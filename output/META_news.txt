Get the FREE App Get the FREE App Australian investors continue to pile into US stocks, chasing outsized returns and their own piece of the artificial intelligence boom. Yet the era of tech giant dominance and a whirlpool of circular investment deals could mean a riskier bet than many realise. The popularity of funds linked to Wall Street's S&P500 index has soared and it's not hard to see why: returns over the past three years are more than 78 per cent compared to about 24 per cent for the local S&P/ASX200. But with just a handful of outsized companies and AI speculation driving broader market growth in 2025, a fund of 500 stocks might be less diversified than most of us think. And therein lies the rub. The so-called Magnificent Seven technology stocks of Apple, Nvidia, Google owner Alphabet, Amazon, Tesla, Meta and Microsoft make up more than a third of the S&P500 index's value, according to IG market analyst Tony Sycamore. "Then if you throw in Netflix and Broadcom, you're getting that dominance rising to closer to 45 per cent," he tells AAP. "Almost half the market cap is covered by nine stocks." By comparison, during the peak that preceded the dot-com crash in 2000, the six top tech companies accounted for roughly 15 per cent of the top 500 US stocks. There are many differences from the dot-com era, namely that most of the magnificent seven have pre-existing businesses that don't depend on AI. However the amount of money flowing into its research is eye-watering. Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Alphabet alone spent an estimated $US350 billion ($A520 billion) in 2025 on AI research and infrastructure, including the data centres required to power the technology's large language models. "There's valid concern around the Mag Seven; they don't seem to have the revenue to offset these heavy debt loads," Mr Sycamore says. "The cash burn for them is extraordinary and earnings have started to slow." The circular flow of funds between the tech juggernauts and into deals with pre-revenue companies like ChatGPT creator Open AI is also a worry despite headlines and agreements delivering vertigo-inducing stock price jumps. "The market is waking up to the fact that those announcements look great on the surface but underneath they're deeply concerning, artificial and prone to unravelling quickly," Mr Sycamore adds. "That is part of the reason why we have seen these tech stocks pull back." OpenAI, potentially the world's most valuable private company with an estimated market capitalisation of $US700 billion, intends spending $US1.4 trillion on AI infrastructure despite not expecting a profit until 2030. The gap has left many wondering where the money will come from. Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston has never seen a case study similar. "There's circular deals going off left, right and centre: Broadcom, AMD ... Nvidia has $US100 billion investment in OpenAI" he says. "And it's really all premised on the idea that, at some stage, OpenAI will be able to completely monetise their offering." But despite launching the first generative AI large language model ChatGPT in June 2018, which is now in its fifth iteration, competition in AI is white-hot. "When you've got so many of them coming up, backed by some massive players that are already seen as better alternatives, if OpenAI monetises at the wrong cost structure then it becomes a major issue," Mr Weston says. With this in mind, Pepperstone is watching Softbank, a Japanese investment holding group riding an "all-in" bet on OpenAI to generate $US22.5 billion funding via loans and the sale of Nvidia and T-Mobile stocks. As one of the biggest private tech deals in history, Softbank's play is seen as a barometer for the AI leader which, as a private concern, can't be accurately valued. Bank of America data points to roughly 94 per cent of tech profits being poured into AI spending, according to InvestorsObserver finance analyst Sam Bourgi. "These companies are spending almost all the money they earn," he says. "Just in September and October, big tech borrowed $75 billion specifically for AI data centres - more than double their normal annual borrowing." Notably, shares in the Tokyo-headquartered conglomerate plummeted more than 40 per cent in October. The implications of tech concentration for Australians invested in S&P500 index funds is straightforward, Mr Bourgi says. "You own a slice of all this risk and your index's performance now depends heavily on whether these six companies' AI bets work out. "If they succeed and AI becomes hugely profitable over the next few years, your index fund will likely perform well. "If they don't and this turns out to be another bubble like 2000, your index fund could suffer significant losses." A 30 per cent drift in AI stocks could mean a 10-15 per cent decline in an S&P500 index fund, which would leave investors in a tricky spot. "You might not see gains for years if the bubble deflates like in 2000," Mr Bourgi says.

Title: 30 hidden gems from 2025 to grab before the Steam Winter Sale ends

Full Content:
2025 was an overwhelming year. Let's savor those positives in unlikely places. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. With each passing year, the PC gaming scene grows increasingly fragmented. More games are released, and on average they're better, too. There's just not enough time to cover them all, and 2025 was packed with gems you probably haven't heard of. For those willing to go just a little off the beaten path, the current Steam Winter Sale looks like a never-ending bounty of undersold treasures. So here's a carefully curated selection of 15 of my favorites to consider during the last couple days of sales season. Here are the rules I'm narrowing things down with: Since the year was so densely packed, I'm annoying the editors by slipping in a thematically related (but less beholden to the rules) alternative to each pick, for 30 games total. As ever, shout out your favourites, or comment if I helped you find something that made your heart sing. Let's go! Price: $21 / £17.50 (30% off) | Developer: Siris Pendrake A stunning testament to what a (mostly) solo developer can do with a modern engine and some stock asset packs. Still in early access, but already a very polished, lengthy and non-linear STALKER-inspired shooter with a funky setting. Mankind is effectively extinct. Lizard-people (which you're one of) have inherited the ruins of our civilization, and ancient fae magics leak in through the cracks of reality, as if rogue super-science wasn't enough. Project Silverfish feels like a pared-down, greased-up version of STALKER. Faster, twitchier, impressively polished (at the expense of some detail), able to run great on even lower-spec machines and requiring less fiddling around between sorties. Expect to be thrown into messy multi-faction battles right off the bat with loads of loot, getting you into deeper expeditions early. Alternatively: ADACA (50% off) - The previous game from the same developer, and effectively two games in one: A Half-Life 2/Halo-inspired story campaign and a STALKER-lite sandbox. Both surprisingly slick (and officially finished as of 2024), but Silverfish's open world & systems are on another level. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Price: $14 / £11.72 (30% off) | Developer: Figburn & Melon Hands up if you've still got a special place in your heart for Flash-era gaming, specifically Newgrounds. Contract Rush DX is a game forged in those familiar fires. It's a little bit Mega Man, a little bit Contra and more than a dash of Alien Hominid, all held together with globs of slick vectorized cartoon animation, unrealistic hyperviolence and goofy humor. They don't often make them like this anymore. Contract Rush DX doesn't rest on its nostalgic laurels though. There's a beefy, smart platformer here, with its main levels playable in any order and each with a distinct feel and mechanical twist. Recruit new characters to access extra areas or tackle bonus side-missions and work your way closer to the lore-laden reveals of the game's well-hidden True Ending. Alternatively: Seafrog (50% off) - Another platforming gem that fell between the cracks, now refreshed and under a new publisher's banner. A slick, high-technique blend of traditional platforming and Tony Hawk style skating, with big rewards for chaining long trick combos, giving every stage real replay value. Price: $12 / £10.05 (40% off) | Developer: LimboLane Not just a hidden gem, but one of my favourites of 2025. You're a Godpoke, wrangler of deities, sent to help put the bickering gods of this bizarre cartoon world back on the straight-and-narrow to avert the apocalypse. A refreshing take on the point-and-click adventure, as rather than hoard every item you find, you make up for your own quiet nature by using your suck 'n' blow megaphone to steal phrases from characters' dialogue and deploying them elsewhere as potential solutions. Or just to goof around. As with LimboLane's previous Smile For Me, this is an entire world of Weird Little Guys, even the cosmically huge gods. Everyone's at least a little bit of a freak, but they're all weirdly lovable. Especially the chaotically helpful 'bizzyboys' gang, the solution to and source of half the game's problems, and frequently featured in some deeply strange FMV puppet-show segments. Alternatively: Kulebra and the Souls of Limbo (40% off) - another offbeat adventure about hanging out with weird little guys of myth and legend. This time you're a snake-spirit in the Latin-American afterlife, trying to puzzle out how to break the eternal day-long loop that the dead are trapped in. Heartfelt, bittersweet and frequently funny. Price: $14 / £11.72 (30% off) | Developer: 13AM Games, Mighty Yell If you were to make a new Missile Command game, what kind of game would it be? Probably not 'Teen drama escape-room with tactical hex-based strategy'. This bizarre hybrid hasn't sold well at all, but it's a shockingly good and engaging time. Four teens set out to explore an abandoned cold war bunker, only to find themselves wrapped up in an escalating crisis necessitating a lot of point-and-click style puzzling and some almost Into The Breach-esque defensive turn-based battling. The combat involves planning moves two or three steps ahead, saving resources by catching multiple incoming missiles in chaining explosions, just like the old arcade game. The two halves dovetail nicely, using smaller defensive battle simulations as puzzle elements, while the larger, higher-stakes battles can dig into your stock of missile launch keycards that you scavenge from the dusty corners of the adventuring puzzle rooms, making resource conservation all the more vital. Tense and smart. Alternatively: Is This Game Trying To Kill Me? (50% off) - Another genre-hopping escape room adventure, although this one feels heavily inspired by Inscryption, as you explore a haunted videogame and the videogames within that videogame while being tormented by the (weirdly affable) entity lurking outside the rain-slick cabin window. Fun, goofy meta-narrative puzzling. Price: $6 / £5.10 (40% off) | Developer: Bubby Darkstar Shooty is our best, last line of defence against a possible robot invasion. Her crack team of robot-hunting pals are goofing off at the beach today. She doesn't have any clean clothes so she's requisitioning her commander's trousers today. Oh, and the robots are finally invading, but they don't seem to be especially threatening so you can just take your time and do some errands around town. Nobody seems too threatened. Shooty Shooty Robot Invasion feels like playing a webcomic. A particularly raucous, bright and chaotic one. Perhaps I'm just weird, but it's one of the funniest games I've played this past year, only really beaten out by Skin Deep. It's 70% exploring and meeting weird people and helping them with their daily problems, 30% light FPS combat as you blast robots using your special high-tech anti-robot bullets that only hurt machines. It's a surprisingly full package as well, clocking in at ~8 hours of shenanigans. Longer, if you're hunting for each mini open world level's secret sidequests. Alternatively: Fragrance Point (50% off) - Another 'Goofing around with weirdos' adventure, with a great rendercore aesthetic and an esoteric sci-fi spin. You're a new being, constructed to complete a very specific mission that you never got told because you accidentally blew up the tutorial by spitting lipstick everywhere. But hey, this space station seems to be a 24/7 party zone, so just go with the flow! Price: $18 / £15 (40% off) | Developer: Blue Banshee In a fit of spectacularly unfortunate timing, Maliki: Poison Of The Past was an offbeat take on the JRPG formula by a French studio released just two days before Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. It's arguably even more French, being based on a very long-running anime-tinged francophone webcomic, although no knowledge of the source material is needed to enjoy this standalone time-travelling adventure in high-intensity gardening. There is a lot going on here. Traditional turn-based RPG combat (with some timeline shenanigans); time-manipulating puzzles reminiscent of Zelda, with each party member bringing a new puzzle-solving power to the mix; even some low-impact farming between sorties across the timeline on your quest to stop the titular Poison, an evil plant-entity spreading its roots across space and time. It would be easy to draw comparisons to Chrono Trigger, but this one is a rich enough mix of inspirations to feel like its own thing. Alternatively: Wander Stars (33% off) - Another offbeat take on classic JRPG tropes, this time from Venezuela, and paying more than a little tribute to Akira Toriyama's wacky world of pint-sized martial artists and screwball comedy. Gorgeous art, simple, fight-heavy progression and creative combat where you collect a deck of words to chain into increasingly silly attack names to yell at full volume. Price: $10.50 / £7 (30% off) | Developer: Woodhound I've always had a soft spot for free-flying PSX-era shooter Forsaken, a faster, louder version of Descent. Despite an excellent (and cheap!) Nightdive remaster, it seemed doomed to fall into obscurity. But tiny studio Woodhound seems to hold a special torch for it too, releasing this roguelike tribute out of early access in 2025. It looks, sounds and plays almost exactly like Forsaken, right down to the intentionally blurry 'early 3D accelerator' textures and overbearing colored lighting, but now with near endless replay value and online co-op support. While Desecrators might lose something by not having hand-crafted levels, it does a very good job of procedurally generating labyrinthine mazes of tunnels, chambers and combat zones to blast through, punctuated with botmatch-style 'invasions' by rival treasure-hunters. It's still growing, too, with new enemies and environments added in a recent update, along with tentative VR support for those with strong stomachs. Alternatively: BRAZILIAN DRUG DEALER 3: I OPENED A PORTAL TO HELL IN THE FAVELA TRYING TO REVIVE MIT AIA I NEED TO CLOSE IT (30% off) - Another very singular tribute, although more of a deep cut. A tongue-in-cheek dive into the world of Brazil's early modding and game-dev scene, filled with in-jokes weirdness and an AMAZING title. But even taken purely on face value, it's a fun shooter running on the original Quake engine. Price: $3 / £2.55 (70% off) | Developer: Leafy Games Short, sweet and low-impact. At three dollars, it's very easy to recommend Wyrmhall, a game about being a funny little goblin running an artifact-cleaning stall in the middle of an interdimensional nexus. Weirdos from across the multiverse wander in, show you their cool (but all gunked up) cursed/blessed/incredibly dangerous doodads, chatting with you as you delouse, scrub and polish them up. The artifacts, not the clients. Although sometimes they're one and the same. Clocking in at just a couple hours long (with no shortage of twists and turns), this isn't an intense or complex game, but it is extremely funny, like playing through an extended Adventure Time skit full of gloriously wacky characters and some fun dialogue options that let you embrace your inner goblin. A good reminder that 'cozy' gaming doesn't just have to be about repackaged farming lifestyle fantasies. Sometimes you just wanna go Goblin Mode. Alternatively: Trash Goblin (40% off) - Would you believe that 2025 had TWO games about being a funny little goblin that cleans up strange artifacts? Trash Goblin is a bit less funny, but more technical, involved and mechanically engaging, using a lot more tools and upcycling to make your own goodies. Hell of a coincidence for lightning to strike twice. Price: $14 / £11.72 (30% off) | Developer: Pocket Trap It's a common lament that Nintendo has little interest in 'traditional' Zelda games now, favoring open world grandiosity over the classic NES and SNES-era format. Fortunately indies have you covered, and few do it as well as Pipistrello. The bones are solid—all the dungeon-crawling, puzzle-solving action you'd expect, fleshed out with a funky modern urban setting populated by rough-edged (but adorable) graffiti-styled critters, and with a few modern ideas like buying character upgrades on credit and paying them off over time. The star of the show is the titular Cursed Yoyo. Weapon, mobility gadget, multifunctional puzzle-solving tool and just fun to show off with, you'll be collecting new tricks for it all game long and each one opens up interesting new paths, making revisiting older areas engaging. Use slanted blocks to hit entire rooms with one spin, slam it against walls to launch yourself backwards over pits, and bypass obstacles by dragging yourself along using its string. It's just a joy to use. Alternatively: Zefyr: A Thief's Melody (75% off) - 'Retro' extends well into the Gamecube era these days, and if you're after something a little more Wind Waker-inspired, Zefyr is an excellent PC alternative. The work of a solo developer over the course of twelve years, this one's a satisfying piratical fantasy adventure with some great puzzle-laden dungeons. Price: $7 / £5.95 (30% off) | Developer: Brenton Wildes Loathe as I am to utter the word 'Metroidbrainia', it feels appropriate here. Lingo 2 is a brilliantly smart word puzzle adventure through a minimalist, Minecraft-esque block labyrinth where you interact with the world by typing letters into terminals. Simple. Except that you have to unlock one letter at a time like Metroid upgrades, and the phrase-and-response puzzles get painfully smart, fast. Sometimes you're looking for a word of the inverse meaning, or an anagram, or a palindrome, or a synonym, or a chain of words that connect several terminals together. The deeper you get, the more puzzles become available, and the more complex the world becomes, with secrets, hidden paths and optional areas seemingly everywhere with puzzles both spatial and lexical. My only gripe is that the game can be a bit US-centric, with some puzzles referring to specific American brands or idioms, but I never found it too egregious. The original Lingo is also discounted, and has its own set of puzzle mechanics so you can play them in any order. Alternatively: Rules & Rodents (40% off) - On the other end of the puzzle scale is Rules & Rodents, which is entirely wordless. A cute little mouse plots a cheese heist/escape armed with a magical scroll that holds pictograms that enable or disable specific gameplay rules controlling both you and the adorably animated rat guards. Just a few hours long, but feels perfectly paced with a surprisingly dramatic finale. Price: $10 / £8.37 (50% off) | Developer: Erlend Kirkeboe, Kay Arne Kirkeboe You can't go 10 minutes without bumping into a Slay the Spire-inspired deckbuilder these days, but few have the scribbly, grimy vision of Skogdal. Set in small-town '90s Norway, you'll be making your way through the streets battling an assortment of meatheads, weirdos and wildlife, all rendered in lumpen pencil-sketch comic style. There's a bit of Beavis and Butthead energy here as your crew of weird losers clash with retro pop culture seen through a uniquely Nordic lens. While each playable character brings their own gimmicks to the table, there's a big focus here on summoning friends into battle, who add their own cards to your deck and often add activatable powers to your party. While run-based, there's an increasingly weird story that unfurls as you complete runs, unlocking new characters (including a knock-off Norwegian Steven Segal) and new routes through the region. Not being Norwegian, some of the gags flew over my head, but most of them feel universal enough to land. Alternatively: Crown Gambit (40% off) - The latest from the team behind previous hidden gem Aetheris. A gorgeously illustrated twist on the card-battler format, split about 50/50 between visual novel-ish gothic knightly intrigue (with multi-choice dialogues) and party-based strategic battles. The two halves interplay, with the size and shape of the combat play-field shifting to reflect the prose. Price: $7.79 / £6.50 (35% off) | Developer: Fami Rough-edged, low-fi and abrasive in style, Schism feels like the kind of game I devoured in my youth. The kind of vaguely punk design that ruled in the late DOS shareware era. Under the intentionally rough aesthetic lies a very smart, experimental take on Binding of Isaac-esque action roguelike shootery. Weird creatures, weird characters, and even weirder item synergies (thoughtfully evolved as this game stewed in early access) make this one refreshing to chew on even if you're played a bunch of Games Like These. Schism isn't afraid to mentally overwhelm the player. Outside of the one small concession of pausing time as you enter a new room (letting you plan your initial movement before all hell breaks looks), there's some Ikaruga-inspired polarity switching mechanics, letting you negate red or blue bullets. You'd think that'd make things easier, but it just gives the game an excuse to blanket the screen with projectiles. Intense fun. Alternatively: Rift Wizard 2 (50% off) - Another low-fi roguelike, but more traditional in design. Positively archaic, even. Rift Wizard 2 feels most closely related to Chaos, an early cast-em-up by X-Com designer Julian Gollop. Rather than crawl through mazes for loot, each floor is a complex, open turn-based tactical battle demanding you use all your spells and summons. Price: $17.50 / £14.69 (30% off) | Developer: Dreamotion Inc. One of the higher-budget games here, released just a couple months ago. A silly but often heartstring-tugging, genre-hopping adventure about a corgi deciding to leave Dog Heaven after catching the distant scent of their human. Antics ensue, rainbow bridges are surfed across, adventures through the afterlife are had and not a single chance is missed to squeeze Big Feels out of the audience. As you might imagine it's not especially challenging stuff, but there's enough variety across the adventure (including a bunch of minigames and light challenges) to keep you engaged and paying attention. Long enough to keep eyes on the screen so you don't miss any of its gorgeously animated cutscenes, bridged with hand-drawn art. There's a real understanding here of how dogs move, especially the inherent wigglyness of short-legged friends like corgis, which means if you've ever had or lost a fuzzy little friend in your life, this one is going to hurt. Alternatively: Koira (50% off) - A surprisingly similar adventure, this one with a silhouetted, storybook aesthetic. A hermit and their dog enjoy life and nature in the mountains, interacting with wildlife, communing with the spirits and absolutely not getting into any life-or-death ordeals or supernatural goings on. Needless to say, the dog is also very good. They all are. Price: $7 / £5.95 (30% off) | Developer: Last Piscean A fantastically smart piece of sci-fi narrative experimentation. After the end of the world, three children discover a time machine. Perhaps the present can be rewritten, but the problem is that you can only send one person back at a time, with a single standing order and maybe one item, and they're going to have to spend a decade in that era before returning to base and reporting in, perhaps bringing back an item with them. Every choice is to be agonized over. The time spent in the past changes your trio. Personalities and statistics warp over time. Piecing together the origins of the apocalypse is just the first part of the puzzle, with over 20 possible endings depending on what factions you nudge or nurture, who you choose to assassinate and which child you choose for each expedition to the past. For a game presented almost entirely in (thoughtfully written) text and low-fi monochrome art, Decade is powerfully evocative. Alternatively: No Time (35% off) - If you want your time travel a little less esoteric and more tangible, this Back To The Future-inspired sandbox immersive sim has been in early access since 2019, and just recently added the final mission in its main story arc, though there's plenty yet to come. Price: $2.50 / £2.14 (50% off) | Developer: Jack Morehart 2025 was mostly a year for playing it safe in the strategy genre. DLCs, familiar genres, remasters and revivals. Kiloton is the sicko pick (I did say fewer, not none)—a minimalist, fast-paced simulation that feels like something lifted straight out of Wargames. The only winning game might be not to play, but playing with nukes can still be pretty fun. It's a lightweight geopolitical sim where you're ideally trying to avoid conflict, but every country is automatically jostling for position, with armies drawn to where there's any gap in defences. Diplomacy IS an option, but might just be denying the inevitable, and matches play out in a matter of minutes. What makes this game especially for sickos is that you play it entirely with the keyboard, with typed menu commands and simple menus navigated with the arrow keys, your clicking keypresses echoed in the game's own soundscape. Great for building tension, and will keep your hands moving quickly as things spiral out of control. Alternatively: Chip n' Clawz vs The Brainioids (30% off) - Would you believe that the creator of X-Com released a new strategy game for 2025, and it totally flew under the radar? A cartoon action-strategy game (a bit like Brutal Legend) playable the whole way through in split-screen co-op or via Friend Pass. A great way to introduce kids to the genre, and not too shabby even for veterans. And that's it for 2025. It wasn't an intentional theme, but there sure were a lot of games about terrifying apocalypses and hanging out with Weird Little Guys, weren't there? Let's avoid the former, and hang on to the latter in 2026. At least the videogames will be good, eh? Once again, I hope I've helped broaden your horizons a little, and maybe introduced you to a game or two to love. As always, check out my previous roundups below (and maybe even my Steam curator page, where everything I enjoy goes), as almost everything from previous sales is back again at even steeper discounts, and still as good as ever: Until next time, and happy new year! The product of a wasted youth, wasted prime and getting into wasted middle age, Dominic Tarason is a freelance writer, occasional indie PR guy and professional techno-hermit seen in many strange corners of the internet and seldom in reality. Based deep in the Welsh hinterlands where no food delivery dares to go, videogames provide a gritty, realistic escape from the idyllic views and fresh country air.

Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over three years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. Its stock price has soared, making it a $4.6 trillion market cap company. The world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in startups, particularly in AI. Nvidia has participated in nearly 67 venture capital deals in 2025, surpassing the 54 deals the company completed in all of 2024, according to PitchBook data. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly increased its investment pace over that period. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 30 deals this year, compared to just one in 2022.) Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.” Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million since 2023 where Nvidia is a named participant, organized from the highest to lowest amount raised in the round. This list shows just how far and wide Nvidia has spread its tentacles in the tech industry, beyond supplying its products. OpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October 2024, reportedly writing a $100 million check as part of a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which invested $1.3 billion according to The New York Times. While PitchBook data indicates Nvidia did not participate in OpenAI’s $40 billion funding round that closed in March, the company announced in September that it would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI over time, structured as a strategic partnership to deploy massive AI infrastructure. Nvidia later revealed in its quarterly filings that it might not follow through, stating, “There is no assurance that any investment will be completed on expected terms, if at all.” Anthropic: In November 2025, Nvidia made its first direct investment in the AI lab, committing up to $10 billion as part of a strategic round that included a $5 billion check from Microsoft. In a “circular” spending agreement, Anthropic committed to spending $30 billion on Microsoft Azure compute capacity, as well as buy Nvidia’s future Grace Blackwell and Vera Rubin systems. Cursor: In November, Nvidia made its first strategic investment in the AI-powered code assistant participating in a massive $2.3 billion Series D round co-led by Accel and Coatue. The deal valued Cursor at $29.3 billion, a nearly 15-fold increase since the start of the year. While Nvidia has long been an enterprise customer, the round marked its official entry as a shareholder alongside Google. xAI: In 2024, OpenAI tried to persuade its investors not to invest in any of its rivals. But Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI last December anyway. Nvidia will also invest up to $2 billion in the equity portion of xAI’s planned $20 billion funding round, Bloomberg reported, a deal structured to help xAI purchase more Nvidia gear. Mistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the third time when the French-based large language model (LLM) developer raised a €1.7 billion (about $2 billion) Series C at a €11.7billion ($13.5 billion) post-money valuation in September. Reflection AI: In October, Nvidia was one of the most significant investors in Reflection AI, contributing to a $2 billion funding round that valued the one-year-old startup at $8 billion. Reflection AI is positioning itself as a U.S.-based competitor to Chinese DeepSeek, whose open source LLM offers a less-expensive alternative to closed source models from companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic. Thinking Machines Lab: Nvidia was among a long list of investors who backed former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab’s $2 billion seed round. The funding, which was formally announced in July, valued the new AI startup at $12 billion. Inflection: One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the more unusual (but increasingly common) outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company co-founded by Mustafa Suleyman, the famed founder of DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future. Crusoe: In October, the chipmaker participated in a $1.4 billion Series E round that valued the AI data center developer at $10 billion. Nvidia first backed the company in late 2024 during its Series D. Crusoe is a key infrastructure partner for the ‘Stargate’ project, building massive data center campuses in Texas and Wyoming to be leased to Oracle specifically to power OpenAI’s workloads. Nscale: After the startup’s $1.1 billion round in September, Nvidia participated in Nscale’s $433 million SAFE funding in October. That’s a deal that secures future equity for investors. Nscale, which formed in 2023 after spinning out of Australian cryptocurrency mining company Arkon Energy, is building data centers in the U.K. and Norway for OpenAI’s Stargate project. Wayve: In May 2024, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. Nvidia is expected to invest an additional $500 million in Wayve, the startup told TechCrunch in September. Wayve is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area. Figure AI: In September, Nvidia participated in Figure AI’s Series C funding round of over $1 billion, which valued the humanoid robotics startup at $39 billion. The chipmaker first invested in Figure in February 2024 when the company raised a $675 million Series B round at a $2.6 billion valuation. Scale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. In June, Meta invested $14.3 billion for a 49% stake of Scale and hired away the company’s co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang, as well as several other key Scale employees. Commonwealth Fusion: The chipmaker participated in the nuclear fusion-energy startup’s $863 million funding round in August. The deal, which also included investors like Google and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, valued the company at $3 billion. Cohere: The chipmaker has invested in enterprise LLM provider Cohere across multiple funding rounds, including the $500 million Series D, which closed in August, valuing Cohere at $6.8 billion. Nvidia first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023. Perplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November 2023 and has participated in most of the subsequent funding rounds of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round closed in December 2024. The chipmaker participated in the company’s July funding round, which valued Perplexity at $18 billion. However, Nvidia did not join the startup’s subsequent $200 million fundraise in September, which boosted the company’s valuation to $20 billion, according to PitchBook data. Poolside: In October 2024, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion. Lambda: AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a $480 million Series D at a reported $2.5 billion valuation in February. The round was co-led by SGW and Andra Capital Lambda, and joined by Nvidia, ARK Invest, and others. A significant part of Lambda’s business involves renting servers powered by Nvidia’s GPUs. Black Forest Labs: Nvidia participated in a $300 million Series B for the German startup behind the “Flux” image generation models in December. The round, which was co-led by Salesforce Ventures and Anjney Midha (AMP) valued the company at $3.25 billion. CoreWeave: Although CoreWeave is no longer a startup, but a public company, Nvidia invested in GPU-cloud provider when it was still one, back in April 2023. That’s when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Nvidia remains a significant shareholder. Together AI: In February, Nvidia participated in the $305 million Series B of this company, which offers cloud-based infrastructure for building AI models. The round valued Together AI at $3.3 billion and was co-led by Prosperity7, a Saudi Arabian venture firm, and General Catalyst. Nvidia backed the company for the first time in 2023. Firmus Technologies: In September, Firmus Technologies, the Singapore-based data center company, received an AU$330 million (approximately $215 million) in funding at an AU$1.85 billion ($1.2 billion) valuation from investors, including Nvidia. Firmus is developing an energy-efficient “AI factory” in Tasmania, an island state of Australia. The startup originally provided cooling technologies for Bitcoin mining. Uniphore: In October, Nvidia joined fellow tech giants AMD, Snowflake, and Databricks to lead a $260 million Series F round into this Business AI company. Uniphore’s multimodal platform helps enterprises automate complex workflows and deploy “AI agents” across customer service, sales, and marketing. Sakana AI: In September 2024, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive Series A round of about $214 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion. Sakana raised another $135 million at a $2.65 billion valuation in November, but Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. Nuro: In August, Nvidia participated in a $203 million funding round for the self-driving delivery startup. The deal valued Nuro at $6 billion, a significant 30% drop from its peak at $8.6 billion valuation in 2021. Imbue: The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt. Waabi: In June 2024, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE. Ayar Labs: In December 2024, Nvidia invested in the $155 million round of Ayar Labs, a company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency. This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup. Kore.ai: The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised $150 million in December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity. Sandbox AQ: In April, Nvidia, alongside Google, BNP Paribas, and others, invested $150 million in Sandbox AQ, a startup developing large quantitative models (LQMs) for handling complex numerical analysis and statistical calculations. The investment increased Sandbox AQ’s Series E round to $450 million and the company’s valuation to $5.75 billion. Hippocratic AI: This startup, which is developing large language models for healthcare, announced in January that it raised a $141 million Series B at a valuation of $1.64 billion led by Kleiner Perkins. Nvidia participated in the round, along with returning investors Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and others. The company claims that its AI solutions can handle non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks such as pre-operating procedures, remote patient monitoring, and appointment preparation. Hippocratic raised another $126 million at a valuation of $3.5 billion in November, but Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. Weka: In May 2024, Nvidia invested in a $140 million round for AI-native data management platform Weka. The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion. Runway: In April, Nvidia participated in Runway’s $308 million round, which was led by General Atlantic and valued the startup developing generative AI models for media production at $3.55 billion, according to PitchBook data. The chipmaker has been an investor in since 2023. Bright Machines: In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a $126 million Series C of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup. Enfabrica: In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica’s $125 million Series B. The startup raised another $115 million in November 2024, but Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. In September, Nvidia reportedly spent over $900 million to hire Enfabrica’s CEO and staff while licensing its technology, in a deal structured as an “acquihire.” Reka AI: In July, AI research lab Reka raised $110 million in a round that included Snowflake and Nvidia. The deal tripled the startup’s valuation to over $1 billion, according to Bloomberg. This post was first published in January 2025.

Title: Apple needs a visionary QB again: It’s past time for game manager Tim Cook to hand off the ball

Time Published: 2026-01-02T15:08:18Z
Full Content:
Update font size. Reset In American football, a “game manager” quarterback is one who protects the ball, executes the playbook, and keeps the scoreboard ticking through steady, conservative play. Tim Cook has been precisely that for Apple: an operations maestro who took the reins from the legendary Steve Jobs in 2011 and transformed the company into a financial juggernaut, ballooning its market cap from $350 billion to over $4 trillion through supply-chain efficiency, massive stock buybacks, and incremental refinements of products created under Apple’s visionary co-founder Steve Jobs. Yet, as Jobs himself might have envisioned, Cook was never meant to be the long-term playmaker — the electrifying, risk-taking, charismatic visionary who redraws the field with bold, game-changing innovations. Jobs built Apple on “insanely great” breakthroughs: the Mac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad. Under Cook’s stewardship, however, the company has increasingly relied on iteration rather than revolution, neglecting opportunities in AI (like the long-stagnant Siri), launching underwhelming entries like Vision Pro in rushed form, and prioritizing financial engineering over audacious product leaps. Nearly 15 years into his tenure — one far longer than Jobs likely intended for a transitional “caretaker” CEO — Apple stands at a crossroads. With executive departures signaling the end of an era and succession planning accelerating, it’s time for Cook to step aside. The world’s most valuable company deserves a charismatic, exciting leader once more: a true visionary capable of reigniting the magic that made Apple not just profitable, but culturally unstoppable. Richard Waters for Financial Times: ‎ The Financial Times’ report that succession planning at Apple is now in high gear makes it seem increasingly likely that the pre-eminent consumer tech company will soon be under new management. Strong demand for the iPhone 17 lifted Apple’s stock market value past $4tn for a while over the past month. With a strong tailwind from the huge stock buybacks that Cook instigated as one of his first acts as chief, the share price is up 20-fold from the day he took over in 2011. But, with artificial intelligence threatening the biggest upheaval to the tech world in decades, Cook will also leave huge questions. His successor will need to demonstrate a stronger appetite for risk and a willingness to bet on a new vision for how technology can reshape people’s lives… His successor will need to show that they can both co-opt AI to reinforce what Cook built while also harnessing its disruptive potential to ride the next consumer tech wave. The botched launch of Apple Intelligence — key parts of which were delayed early this year — was worrying. How much that will matter in the long run is hard to tell… But there are obvious risks to taking a back seat in the AI revolution. If LLMs are at the centre of innovation, then acting merely as a rent collector while leaving it to others to define the next must-have digital experiences would put Apple in an uncomfortable position. Also, if LLMs come to represent what is essentially a new operating system, they will have strategic importance. Hopefully, the days of a COO masquerading as an Apple CEO are finally drawing nigh. Apple deserves a visionary leader who can once again drive relentless, world-changing product innovation. – MacDailyNews, December 9, 2025 The Vision Pro headset represented his biggest gamble on a new device… But as a compelling vision of how mixed-reality headsets will change your life — the kind of thing that Steve Jobs excelled at — it was a flop. Instead, Meta has stolen a lead with a more lightweight, fashion-conscious range of “smart” glasses… Apple’s next chief will need to increase the scale of the company’s bets. Among the first jobs: convincing its shareholders, who have become accustomed to the iPhone’s steady profits, that it is time to look beyond Tim Cook’s gravy train. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: As our own SteveJack wrote last July: Steve Jobs famously said of Tim Cook, “Tim is not a product person, per se.” That has turned out to be an understatement, especially with the fact that the Apple Watch, AirPods, and even the Vision Pro concept began under Jobs. I’ve closely observed Apple for decades and I believe that Steve Jobs never meant for Tim Cook to be Apple’s CEO in 2025. When Jobs handpicked Cook as his successor in 2011, many believed it was a strategic move to stabilize the company during a tumultuous transition following Jobs’ untimely death. However, I contend that Jobs intended Cook to serve as a short-term CEO, a 3-5 year placeholder to mollify investors, not to lead Apple for nearly a decade and a half, stagnating its innovative spirit, jettisoning innovative executives, while relying on financial engineering, mainly in the form of hundreds of billions of dollars in buybacks, to prop up the company’s success. Jobs, a visionary known for his relentless pursuit of groundbreaking products, built Apple into a cultural and technological titan with the Mac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad. His genius lay in anticipating consumer needs before they did. Cook, hired from Compaq in 1998 as Senior Vice President of Worldwide Operations, was the operational mastermind behind Apple’s supply chain efficiency, going all-in on CCP-controlled China to maximize Apple’s profit margins. Jobs clearly valued Cook’s logistical prowess, but I believe Jobs saw Cook as a caretaker, not a long-term visionary, expecting him to maintain stability for a few years until a product-focused, visionary successor emerged. Under Cook, Apple’s market capitalization soared from $376 billion in 2011 to over $3.9 trillion in early 2025 making it the world’s most valuable company (it has since shed some $800 billion over the year, falling to third place behind Nvidia and rival Microsoft). Yet, much of this growth stems from financial engineering, service expansions like iCloud and Apple Music, and a steady stream of annual incremental product updates, rather than revolutionary Jobsian innovation. The Apple Watch, AirPods, and Vision Pro were initiated under Jobs’ tenure, with their completion coming during Cook’s tenure. The Apple Car project, also conceived by Jobs, was abandoned after a long, chaotic, and costly period under Cook. It’s clear that Cook lacks the disruptive, charismatic spark Steve Jobs infused throughout Apple. Basically, all of Apple’s successes under Cook are iterations of Steve Jobs’ products and services. Cook’s lack of hands-on product involvement has slowed innovation, with half-baked products like the Vision Pro being launched to consumers too early and, unsurprisingly, failing to sell. Apple clearly missed the generative AI (GenAI) paradigm shift under Cook and has been struggling to catch up ever since. Steve Jobs likely would not have released the Vision Pro and visionOS in the condition they were launched under Tim Cook. Jobs very likely would have not neglected Siri (which he purchased) for over a decade and a half and would almost certainly have foreseen GenAI early. Very likely, Jobs focus on Siri would have led him and Apple to GenAI first. Visionary Jobs’ main focus was about creating “insanely great” products; Cook’s seems to be about iteration and other, side pursuits. If Jobs intended Cook as a relatively short-term placeholder, the question remains: who was meant to follow? Speculation points to figures like former software chief Scott Forstall — who Cook rather quickly forced out of the company, ostensibly over the botched Maps launch (which way okayed by Cook, by the way) – and head product designer Jony Ive, who left Apple after years of feeling unchallenged under Cook. Jobs highly valued both executives, even granting Ive more operational power than Cook at the time of his death. Today, Ive is collaborating with OpenAI on a potentially revolutionary AI product, not working for Apple. The departure of these executives, whether explicit or tacit, conveniently solidified Cook’s long-term hold on the CEO role. While Cook’s canned-video tenure has been financially stellar overall, Apple has for many years coasted and thrived on Jobs’ lingering momentum, propped up by Cook’s beige operational savvy and financial engineering. After Cook’s tenure finally, blessedly ends, only time will reveal if Apple can rediscover its Jobsian revolutionary edge. ‎ Please help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.

He should have retired 8-10 years ago. “The Vision Pro headset represented his biggest gamble on a new device… But as a compelling vision of how mixed-reality headsets will change your life — the kind of thing that Steve Jobs excelled at — it was a flop. Instead, Meta has stolen a lead with a more lightweight, fashion-conscious range of “smart” glasses…” the Vision Pro is NOT a flop. it’s spectacular technology that’s very much a Version 1 (/developer) device. a lot of apple’s new tech was a ‘flop’ at launch, and then iterated over time into successful mass market products. the Vision Pro represents such a leap forward that a bold new less consumer-friendly opening salvo was necessary to start the wheels turning. eventually the technology will evolve into a viable next generation product. A product may be cool & advanced, but if it represents 8% of the market, it’s not sustainable and in business terms, it’s a flop. From the beginning, AAPL forecasted 3 million units for the first year, but early sales estimates landed around 200,000 units. Flopping early. When a WEARABLE item is notoriously uncomfortable, in-spite of offering a magical experience when using, it’s a blunderous flop. Jobs would have breathed flames on just this one aspect alone. Easy to discern (pain), relatively easy to fix, but still released! From what I gather, someone with needed acute standards, could make AVP market-relevant. This is just one products during Cook’s term that was befuddlingly mishandled. Siri agrees, as she knows. You are correct John. My Vision Pro was only used sporadically since I bought it (lots of travel and caregiving for family) in late 2024, but over the past few weeks i’ve been using it daily and I am astounded at how much the experience has improved. Little things are better like the digital crown now being able to control either environment immersion or volume depending on which icon you are looking at. And big things like pass-through video quality noticeably improving, eye tracking and gestures being even more accurate and being able to view my iPad Pro as a giant display (like Mac Virtual Display but without widescreen options). Obviously price was always going to be a limiting factor but issues like bulk or discomfort have been massively overblown. Apple had to get this product out into the wild in order to start iterating on it and improving it through real-world use. Even in 2026 this is bleeding-edge tech that’s a marvel to experience. The technologies developed for the Vision Pro will trickle down to more consumer friendly (and less exciting) glasses. By the end of the decade I expect the Vision Pro to look more like 80s visor-style sunglasses that you can quickly slip on and off (perhaps still with an external battery or tethered to a Mac/iPad). My primary complaints against Vision Pro is the poor marketing. It was never meant to be a pair of smart glasses that you walk around in, that’s a separate product category that we may see a preview of later this year. Vision Pro is an immersive portal into your digital world primarily for use at home or work. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Vitalik Buterin maps Ethereum’s 2026 rebellion against centralised ‘overlords’

About us Copy link Ethereum is charging into 2026 with a manifesto — not a roadmap. That message comes directly from co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who said that Ethereum is the “rebellion” against “centralised overlords.” “We’re building decentralised applications,” Buterin said on X. “Applications that run without fraud, censorship or third-party interference.” The $365 billion blockchain network aims to be “civilisational infrastructure” that can resist censorship, service intermediaries, and corporate dominance, he said. “These properties sound radical,” he wrote, “but we must remember that a generation ago any wallet, kitchen appliance, book or car would fulfill every single one of them.” Buterin’s note comes as power and wealth in the technology industry become increasingly concentrated in the hands of just a few top corporate players from Silicon Valley, who are all highly centralised. The Mag 7 US tech companies, such as Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla, are now worth more than the combined stock markets of Japan, Canada, and the UK. “Ethereum is the rebellion against this,” Buterin said. “Fortunately, we have powerful tools on our side,” he wrote. “But we need to apply them, and we will.” Buterin may be championing Ethereum’s decentralised nature, but many of the banks, traditional financial firms and fintechs exploring launching stablecoins are doing so on the Ethereum blockchain — letting centralised companies use the digital ledger. Ethereum is kicking off the new year trading nearly 40% below its August all-time high of $4,950. Investors in recent months have been relentlessly dumping exchange-traded funds backed by the second-largest crypto. DefiLlama data shows $616 million in Ethereum ETF selling in December, adding to November’s $1.4 billion in liquidations. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 stock index is still hovering near all-time highs. Other assets, such as gold, are also pushing to record highs amid strong macroeconomic tailwinds. To be sure, Ethereum has plenty of bullish institutional supporters. Tom Lee, chairman of digital asset treasury firm Bitmine, said on X that he expects Ethereum to have a good 2026. “Gold moves lead crypto,” Lee said. “If these large commodity markets make such a move, how can one be skeptical of digital assets in 2026?” Lance Datskoluo is DL News’ Europe-based markets correspondent.

2025 in phones, computing, TVs, gaming, cameras, streaming and more When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. So farewell, 2025 – you were frequently exciting, regularly chaotic, occasionally frustrating but always interesting. And that’s how we like it around here. It was a year in which often fairly iterative improvements to hardware were overshadowed by rapid and significant advances on the computing side of things. I’m talking, of course, about AI, which is now so dominant within the tech world that it’s increasingly hard to find a device that doesn’t have an AI brain. Not that I’m complaining, because the leaps made in 2025 by the likes of OpenAI’s Sora and Google’s Gemini were truly astonishing; the pace of change is such that it feels like we’re squeezing about a decade’s worth of advances into each year now, and I wouldn’t like to predict what the state of play will be in 12 months’ time. Well, other than to say that we’ll be taking for granted things which seem almost impossible right now – although as our AI Editor Graham Barlow notes below, maybe we’re already doing that. In comparison, it often looked in 2025 as though things were slowing down on the hardware side. Could Apple really make its already-excellent MacBooks much better? Could Samsung improve much on the superb Galaxy S series? Was there much scope for OLED TVs or wireless headphones or mirrorless cameras to develop? The answer was yes, yes and yes. Though the upgrades to many models may not have been as big as those on the software side, they were frequently excellent in their own right. The improvements to battery life, screen tech and camera lenses may not be as flashy as those on the AI front, but they can make a real difference to how we use our devices on a daily basis. In many ways, tech fans have never had it so good. Whether that will continue in 2026 remains to be seen. AI now looks to be having a direct – and negative – effect on component prices, which could make your favorite new phone or laptop more expensive in the coming year. We might also see stock shortages in some areas, which could further inflate those price tags. It looks like we’re set for another year of exciting, chaotic, frustrating and interesting news, then – and we’ll be here with you every step of the way. Until then, I hope you’ve enjoyed reading TechRadar in 2025, and have a happy New Year! Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. This year was marked by astonishing leaps in AI capabilities, which I tried to not only report on but experience in full. From my first experience with ‘vibe coding’ to wild leaps of fancy with Veo 3 (and later the Sora app) to creating my own digital double, AI’s fast-changing capabilities constantly amazed me. Never in four decades of covering emerging technologies have I seen anything like it: AI’s rise continues to be a heady mixture of enthusiastic adoption tinged with white-knuckled fear about what it all means for jobs, and for humanity, and nothing we saw in 2025 did much to resolve that anxiety. However, it was my conversations with those leading the AI and wider innovation charge that stood out. My interviews with Amazon’s Panos Panay about Alexa+ and Google’s Sameer Samat about the future of Android were particularly memorable, as was the moment when one of Apple’s top executives threw his brand-new iPhone Air to me during a video podcast and insisted that I try to bend it. The rise of humanoid robots was a trend that shocked and pleased me in equal measure, though I’ve tried to temper my enthusiasm with the knowledge that clever marketing and eye-popping videos will only get us so far. We all want the ultimate home robot, but I still don't think many of us are willing to pay $20,000 to get it. Away from all the AI and robots, I spent much of the year trying new phones, including redesigned iPhones and an incredibly thin folding Samsung phone, along with a wide range of wearable technology that included the Galaxy XR headset, and some very exciting AR glasses from Meta and Google’s Android XR group. Experiencing these felt like peering into our near technological future, which increasingly will be filled with on-demand AI, flexible phones, and maybe those robots. For all the talk of breakthroughs and hype, 2025 felt less like the year AI changed everything and more like the year it quietly became unavoidable. While the much-hyped arrival of super-powerful artificial general intelligence (AGI), predicted for 2025 by many, simply hasn’t materialized, the year has still been a strong one for companies such as OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic, and Google. That said, there have also been some massive flops; and as for Apple, it feels like yet another year in which it slipped further behind in the AI race. ChatGPT maintained its vice-like grip as the most popular AI chatbot in the world, though it hasn’t been plain sailing for OpenAI. Legal challenges, particularly the copyright infringement claim brought by The New York Times, have continued to dog the company, and in June its servers crashed for a couple of days, giving the world a brief taste of life without the ubiquitous chatbot. OpenAI then fumbled the ball with the release of its GPT-5 model, which came across as cold and unemotional compared to the previous GPT-4o. For millions of users who’d come to rely on the chatbot as something closer to a trusted companion it felt like a best friend had undergone a personality transplant overnight, forcing OpenAI to make the legacy 4o model available again. The company has also lost a little ground to Google’s Gemini in recent months. The arrival of Gemini 3 Pro in November was well received, and on the image front, Gemini’s Nano Banana and Nano Banana Pro proved superior to ChatGPT for image generation. OpenAI responded with a new image-generation model in December. AI-powered pets and toys also began to appear this year. We took Moflin for a spin, until we accidentally fried its battery. More broadly, the dominant theme of the year was that every product must now have AI built into it in some form, and no company exemplifies this approach better than Microsoft, which has spent the year enthusiastically stuffing Copilot into just about everything it makes. Finally, the year looks set to end on a high note for Amazon. Alexa+, the AI-powered version of Alexa that Amazon has been promising all year but hasn’t yet managed to fully roll out, may finally be getting a web version, at least in the US. 2025 was the year of the super-thin phone, writes Roland Moore-Colyer, Managing Editor, Mobile Computing, with the release of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge in the first half of the year, and the iPhone Air in the second. These handsets grabbed headlines with their svelte proportions, but so far sales figures have yet to match the hype. That’s likely due to their relatively high prices in the face of already pretty slim iPhones and Galaxy and Pixel handsets, all of which saw the expected yearly upgrades with the iPhone 17, Galaxy S25 and Pixel 10 lines respectively. While the upgrades to the iPhone 17 family appeared incremental at first glance, I'd argue they're a bigger deal when you dig into the details: there was a new design and cooling system for the Pro phones, the standard model finally got a 120Hz display, and Apple's 48MP 'Fusion' camera came to every iPhone in the lineup, including the Air (the Plus model went the way of the dodo). AI found its way into more phones and more features, with Google’s Pixel phones in particular boasting a whole host of genuinely useful smart tools. Meanwhile, Apple just about managed to distract us from the shortcomings of Apple Intelligence with its flashy Liquid Glass design and the eye-catching Cosmic Orange iPhone 17 Pro. Some of the most interesting phones came from smaller brands, with the Nothing Phone 3 offering something a little different without scrimping on flagship features. There was the Oppo Find X9 Pro with its strange but useful camera kit, while the OnePlus 15 was the only phone to earn a maximum five-star review from us this year. There were also a clutch of affordable phones from the likes of Motorola and Xiaomi, proving that you don’t have to pay a lot to get a very capable smartphone these days. We saw further evolution in the folding phone space, with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 leading the way, and Samsung also unveiled its first tri-folding phone, with the Galaxy Trifold joining Huawei's Mate XT, and teasing a future of devices that truly blend phones and tablets. We may even see a foldable iPhone in 2026, but don’t hold your breath. When it came to computing, 2025 didn't start off as the most promising year. While 2024 felt like a year of revolutionary change, with the explosive growth of AI, the fall of Intel, and the rise of Arm-based laptops that were actually worth buying, this year has felt more like we're in a holding pattern, as the innovations of the past few years are iterated on and refined.The year kicked off with Nvidia launching its latest generation of consumer graphics cards, the RTX 5000 series, at CES 2025, and they encapsulated the ‘evolution, not revolution’ theme, with some great new features that haven't fundamentally shaken up the industry, as the introduction of ray tracing with the RTX 2000 series did. Of course, making a great product even better is no bad thing, and our components editor and GPU expert John Loeffler was suitably impressed, enthusing in his RTX 5090 review that “If you're a gamer, you'll still get impressive gen-on-gen performance improvements over the celebrated RTX 4090, and the Nvidia RTX 5090 is really the first consumer graphics card I've tested that can get you consistent, high-frame-rate 8K gameplay.”I have an RTX 5090 and I love it, and I've also been impressed by its 8K performance in modern games, but with the majority of PC gamers still playing at 1080p, this high-end GPU might be a bit too expensive to justify. Other releases from AMD and Intel, plus Apple’s latest M5 chip, continued the theme of impressive releases that don’t massively change the computing landscape.Perhaps the biggest event in 2025 was the continued rise of AI. Recently, the AI boom has led to a global shortage of memory, which has in turn caused an increase in the prices of devices that use it. All of a sudden, PCs, RAM, and GPUs look set to get increasingly expensive, though some, like our computing editor Christian Guyton, aren’t too worried – yet. Personally, the end-of-year drama is making me nostalgic for those early months when 2025 felt rather boring. This year saw two really interesting developments in TV technology, with the first being the arrival of a whole new kind of ‘Tandem RGB’ OLED TV panel from LG. This appeared in the LG G5, helping it to score the maximum five stars in our review, and in the fantastic Panasonic Z95B, enabling both TVs to hit stunning levels of brightness and color depth, but with reduced power consumption. However, this new screen technology didn’t win either of those sets our TV of the Year award – that went to the Samsung S95F, which not only earned its own perfect 5-star review, but was also voted the top TV in the most categories by the judges in our flagship OLED TV showdown, which pitted it against the LG G5, Panasonic Z95B, and Sony Bravia 8 II. The second big tech development was the arrival of RGB mini-LED tech – and, make no mistake, this is the next big thing. It’s more efficient than current mini-LED tech, and is capable of richer colors and less light leakage from bright areas to dark ones, and it could be the tech to finally knock OLED off its perch. We know that Samsung, LG, TCL and Hisense will all launch RGB mini-LED TV ranges in 2026, but the Hisense UX116 was the only TV to use it in 2025 – and it was a mixed bag, with performance issues that disappointed given its eye-wateringly high price. Still, we’re excited to see how this tech develops. But the biggest thing in TVs this year was the TVs themselves – as in, they got big and they got affordable. TCL and Hisense launched 85-inch and 100-inch TVs that were within the budgets of regular mortals, and 75-inch TVs are becoming positively cheap, while still being good. While new tech is exciting, huge TVs like the Hisense U8N and TCL QM7K becoming more affordable is the change that made the biggest difference for customers. This year XR or 'extended reality' took center stage, thanks in large part to Android XR hardware finally breaking cover in the shape of the Samsung Galaxy XR headset. We also tested prototype Android XR glasses ahead of their expected release in the coming year, and they’re impressive (the glasses at least, the headset less so right now). Google, along with its Android partners, looks set to seriously challenge Meta in 2026. For its part Meta debuted several new smart wearables over the past 12 months, including two pairs of Oakley smart glasses – the stylish HSTNs and the sporty Vanguards, the latter of which are perfect for runners when used with a compatible Garmin watch. We also saw a Gen 2 model of the Meta Ray-Bans, and the company's latest step towards full-on AR specs, the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which as you can probably guess feature a display for the specs to relay info visually. We’ve tested them, and they’re everything Google Glass wanted to be, but right now they're not easy to get hold of. What about VR headsets proper? Valve surprised no one (because the device was so heavily leaked before launch) with its Steam Frame headset announcement. Key details like the price are still a mystery, but it will be landing in 2026 – and when it does, the spec sheet teases a device that could seriously challenge the reigning champion of VR, the Meta Quest 3. Depending on how Valve handles the launch, I wouldn’t be surprised if it makes all other headsets feel obsolete – even the Galaxy XR and Apple Vision Pro. Talking of Apple's mixed-reality spatial-computing headset, we got a new version with an M5 chip and comfier strap, but while it's a worthwhile upgrade the price still feels too high. If 2024 was the year niche UK hi-fi brands took over the dance floor amid a hiatus from audio's heavy hitters (see Bowers & Wilkins' fantastic Pi8 earbuds or Cambridge Audio's inaugural, affordable, adorable P100 cans), 2025 was the year the big dogs returned to the party and got their groove back. We got five major headphones releases in 2025, starting with the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds in February. The hotly anticipated update to the 2019 Powerbeats Pro proved that Apple could indeed deliver heart-rate monitoring in its earbuds. Cut to May and Sony's WH-1000XM6 landed, to finally knock the 2020-issue WH-1000XM4 off the top spot in our best headphones guide. It was a similar story with the June arrival of the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen), quickly followed by the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) in September – a two-pronged attack on the market that saw Bose reinstated as the king of ANC. However, this roundup wouldn't be complete without a nod to the biggest launch of them all: the fall arrival of Apple's AirPods Pro 3. The shape's different, the ANC is twice as good, and yes, like the Powerbeats Pro 2 they also keep tabs on your ticker, in a slightly different way, and with increasing third-party fitness-app support. Still the most popular earbuds in the world? Absolutely. Elsewhere, Spotify Lossless finally landed, at no cost to Premium subscribers, offering almost-as-good-as-Apple-Music resolution at up to 24-bit/44.1kHz. While Lossless wasn't a huge hit with fans initially, the big green streaming machine's popularity continues to grow, despite concerns over artist payments. Oh, and if you take note of just one audio brand name this year, let it be WiiM. As Sonos continues to tackle trust issues among its once-loyal fanbase, the plucky multi-room underdog unveiled its WiiM Sound (and now the WiiM Sound Lite) premium hi-res speakers – and the firm would love to help you build your wireless sound system around them. 2025 was full of pleasant surprises for photographers. The Sigma BF was truly out of the ordinary, being dubbed ‘the camera Apple would have made’, while the Caira with its Nano Banana AI skills showed us a glimpse of how on-the-go generative editing can work in an actual camera. Fujifilm and OM System showed us that user experience matters with the quirky X half and retro OM-3 respectively, while Hasselblad and Nikon delivered strong offerings of their own – my favorite stills camera ever, the X2D II, and a new player in the cinema-camera game, the Nikon Zr. A special shoutout goes to Nikon for becoming the best-value camera brand this year, notably for the excellent Z5 II, which is our Camera of the Year, and Z50 II. It was arguably an even better year for new lenses than cameras, with Sigma, Sony and Viltrox in particular knocking it out the park with world-first and affordable optics. Canon continues to lock out third parties from its full-frame camera lineup, but that decision feels more justified after it launched the affordable and capable 45mm F1.2 STM prime. A sense of order was restored towards the end of the year when Canon and Sony launched their anticipated mid-range full-frame cameras: the EOS R6 III and A7 V, both of which are integral to their lineups. The long-threatened US ban on DJI products finally came into effect, and we saw a couple of major product launches from the brand in the build-up to it: the incredible (sort of) sub-250g Mini 5 Pro, and the DJI Osmo 360 – its first foray into 360 cameras, and rival to both the Insta 360 X5 and GoPro’s new Max 2. DJI is also being tipped to launch its first 360 drone soon, but Insta360 got there first with the truly innovative Antigravity A1. Overall, it’s been a good year for camera fans, with demand seemingly remaining strong in the face of competition from increasingly capable smartphones. I’m predicting that the consumer and cinema camera spaces will continue converging in 2026, and I hope the likes of Viltrox expand our options with new and affordable autofocus zoom lenses. Gaming in 2025 was largely dominated by the arrival of the Nintendo Switch 2. It’s a safe improvement on the original Switch, and one that epitomizes the ‘evolution not revolution’ approach to console development. The specs sheet won’t blow anyone’s socks off, but it’s a superb package that cements the Switch's position as the go-to handheld console; and it was so popular in the pre-order and launch phases that it took months for retailers to catch up with demand. It’s been backed up by some excellent games too, including Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, Kirby Air Riders, and Pokémon Legends Z-A. Sony had its own say in the gaming handheld space, breathing new life into the PlayStation Portal handheld device, which is now capable of excellent cloud streaming. This has elevated the handheld, which we were already big fans of, to impressive new heights. The PS5’s game library got a bump with Death Stranding 2: On the Beach and Ghost of Yotei, as well as titles including Borderlands 4, Battlefield 6, Arc Raiders and TechRadar Gaming’s Game of the Year, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Elsewhere, indie games ruled, with the likes of Blue Prince, Hades 2, and Hollow Knight: Silksong proving standouts in a strong year for releases. It’s been a year to forget for Xbox, however, and its woes only accentuated the aforementioned successes for Nintendo and Sony. For starters, more Xbox games – including Gears of War: Reloaded – arrived on PS5, while others are set to follow, including the symbol of Xbox itself, Halo. Meanwhile studios were shuttered and prospective games cancelled, and to make matters worse the Xbox X/S were outsold by a tiny family console, the Nex Playground, over Black Friday. All in all it’s been tough going for Team Green. As for 2026, it’s beginning to feel like the pace of progress towards next-gen consoles will quicken, and the game release calendar looks well stocked. However, a titan looms: Grand Theft Auto 6 is now slated for release in November after being originally planned for late 2025, and the whole gaming world is going to revolve around its arrival. Last year, I ended my contribution to this round-up by predicting a move away from fitness watches towards screenless trackers, such as a new WHOOP model, writes Matt Evans, Senior Editor, Fitness, Wellness & Wearables. Well, we got not one, but two new WHOOPs, and they were… fine. But, as prices rose, I found the ongoing subscription model far too expensive. However, my prediction that we’d move away from smartwatches hasn’t really been borne out. Wearable tech isn’t changing much in the mainstream, with the highest-profile releases being a slate of new watches from Garmin, Apple, Samsung, Google and OnePlus, and they’ve been as popular as ever. Look beyond those big releases, however, and interesting new stuff is out there. A subscription-free WHOOP competitor band was launched by Polar, while Core Devices, the resurrected Pebble watch company led by its original founder, unveiled a pair of watches inspired by the original Pebble designs, complete with low-power LCD-style screens, and open-source software that anyone with the know-how can tinker with. Core Devices also launched a new kind of smart ring with a button and a microphone, which the company says acts as “external memory for the brain”. Elsewhere, the AirPods Pro 3 now have built-in heart rate sensors, and Meta teamed up with Garmin to bring us the Oakley Meta Vanguard sports specs. Cool new wearable innovations are happening, but it all still feels quite fringe. My innovation of the year, however, came from Google. The Google Pixel Watch 4 is the first properly repairable smartwatch, as you’re able to take it apart and replace the battery and display. This enables you to change individual parts rather than the whole watch, reducing your contribution to e-waste, and saving you money in the long run. Almost every other piece of wearable tech from every other company is still a sealed unit that will ultimately end up being disposed of, and I hope Google's move could be the catalyst for change that the wasteful wearable tech industry sorely needs. The biggest story of 2025 broke late in the year, and it concerned off-screen studio machinations rather than on-screen drama. Netflix’s $82.7bn bid for Warner Bros. sent shockwaves through the industry when it was announced in early December, and provoked a counter-bid from Paramount Skydance. There’s still a long way to go before a deal is approved, but should Netflix acquire one of the film world’s most iconic studios it would be a landmark moment for the streaming sector, and would represent a seismic shift for the entertainment industry as a whole. Turning to the year's big theatrical releases, and numerous new movies flopped at the box office, including some with huge names attached (I’m looking at you, Dwayne Johnson and The Smashing Machine). Heck, with Captain America: Brave New World, Thunderbolts*, and The Fantastic Four: First Steps all underperforming, even the usually reliable Marvel Studios didn’t have a money-spinning hit on its hands. I wonder how many people predicted that animated and live-action/CGI hybrids would rule the theatrical roost, led by multi-billion dollar-spinning flicks like Lilo & Stitch, Zootopia 2, and Ne Zha II… As for the major streaming services, users endured more of the now-customary annual price hikes, while Max raised eyebrows by rebranding itself – again – to HBO Max. On the screen, unexpected hits such as HBO medical drama The Pitt, plus Netflix's ‘one-shot’ drama Adolescence and pop-culture phenomenon Kpop Demon Hunters, proved that not even the savviest industry exec can really be sure what viewers will latch onto. Add in the return of unmissable shows including Severance and Stranger Things amid the glut of great and not-so-great film and TV releases, and there was plenty to keep our eyeballs engaged. Now, what have you got in store for us, 2026? It's been a slow but not insignificant year in home technology as legacy brands scramble to keep pace with bigger, already tech-savvy players vying for their spot in our homes – whether that's Breville reinventing the toaster with a proprietary optical sensor, IKEA launching new renewable energy solutions, or Eufy and Dreame duking it out to give us the most effective stair-climbing robot vacuum.Some brands were less innovative than others though. Dyson left some of us feeling snubbed with its 'new' (read: decade-old) vacuum, while Shark's TurboBlade Cool + Heat failed to impress despite its noble attempt at mimicking other SharkNinja product's viral fame. Elsewhere we saw big plays from Amazon and Google in the smart home space, with the arrival of their AI-bolstered home assistants. Amazon's Alexa+ and Google's Gemini for Home both entered Early Access beta in the US, and while the early reviews for both have been mixed, it's a promising glimpse into the future of the connected home. Both of those services are subscription-based offerings, and subscriptions look set to become a major battleground for smart-home brands, and a bone of contention between brands and their customers, as companies attempt to lock users into their ecosystems, as we've already seen with video doorbells. Between that, and brands like Samsung using screen-loaded appliances as advertising billboards around the home, now might be a good time to really think about which brands you want want to invest in as you build your smart home.

Title: Beyond AI: 5 tech trends that will force you to pay more and rethink what’s ‘real’

When a friend and I recently got into a heated debate about artificial intelligence and its impact, I didn’t take sides. Instead, I countered his arguments with facts, even as he grew emotional and claimed that AI was the greatest enemy of humans. At the beginning of last year, I had already predicted that AI would be everywhere, and I was right. As a tech journalist, it comes naturally to me to observe key trends, anticipate the future, and form opinions. That said, it’s not my job to sell you something; influencers and YouTubers are already doing that very well. However, if AI defined 2025, this year is likely to be more decisive and unexpected, as artificial intelligence moves beyond chatbots and smartphones to create entirely new product categories — ones that had been teased for years but never truly materialised from a consumer perspective. But 2026 isn’t going to be about a single trend. It will be shaped by a mix of ideas, some of which may or may not work, but would stay and could shape the personal technology market and social media. I was scrolling through Instagram the other day when my eyes landed on a video featuring two babies engaging in playful banter (precisely the kind of content that gets maximum views in India) portrayed as a girlfriend and boyfriend. I must have watched a few of those short videos before realising they were generated by artificial intelligence, and only after paying close attention did I notice subtle changes that were barely visible without a side-by-side comparison. Since then, AI-generated videos have taken over my feed, especially clips of cartoony cats dancing to songs from Dhurandhar. I remember I joined Instagram (not officially, but through an invisible account) to watch videos of lion cubs, and now there are AI-generated versions of those videos as well, mostly funny and harmless. With platforms themselves encouraging AI videos, and tools like OpenAI’s Sora capable of generating videos of virtually anything in just a few minutes, millions of users will inevitably be fooled into thinking AI-generated videos are real. In India, hardly any such videos carry warning labels, making them almost indistinguishable from reality. That could pose a real problem, blurring the lines of what people can trust. This raises a serious question: it won’t be about whether you can tell the difference between what is real and what is not, but whether AI-generated videos change our relationships with other humans and affect how we perceive the world around us. The year has just begun, and I am already receiving feelers from my sources about an increase in smartphone and laptop prices, and it won’t be short-lived. The trend could continue for almost the entire year. For average buyers, phones already cost a month’s salary, and although many Indians purchase them on EMIs, ownership still comes at a hefty cost. Given the current shortage of memory chips, higher memory costs are likely to be passed on to consumers, which, in turn, will drive up the average selling prices of smartphones. This is primarily due to a shortage of memory chips, particularly dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), which is used in AI data centres and is also critical for smartphones. Lately, DRAM prices have surged as demand has outstripped supply, pushing up component costs. The biggest memory chip suppliers are prioritising data centre and AI companies that are flush with cash, and this shortage is expected to last until at least 2027. I am told that most smartphones launching early this year will be more expensive, though companies are likely to sweeten deals with tempting cashback offers and EMIs. I have also heard that smartphone prices, especially in the low- to mid-range segment, will rise once companies exhaust their existing stock. It is also possible for smartphone brands to launch phones with stripped-down RAM. Laptops, particularly gaming-focused models that are memory-hungry, may also see higher price tags. Enough of apps and the debate over whether to add a telephoto lens to a smartphone or how thin a phone can be. For 2026 and beyond, tech companies are pumped up to find ways to sell smart glasses for your face. While mixed-reality headsets never really took off and augmented reality glasses are still years away from becoming mainstream, in the immediate future (especially throughout this year) I foresee tech companies going all in on smart glasses, offering different capabilities such as small heads-up displays, AI features, built-in cameras, audio-only, and both tethered and wireless designs across varied price points, from mainstream and affordable to luxury. Meta has already proved that there is a market, even if still a tiny one, for smart glasses with its Ray-Ban and Oakley models. Others will follow suit and launch new smart glasses, ideally designed to be worn all day, every day. Just don’t expect smart glasses to replace your smartphone yet. However, tech companies are already plotting strategies to sell basic smart glasses that work as companions, much like your earbuds, smartwatch, or smart ring, and eventually reach a stage where they become as capable as a smartphone. Right now, whether you agree or not, smart glasses are exactly where feature phones once were, and it may take a long time before they become as advanced as modern smartphones. I may sound a bit futuristic, but this time I will take the side of Elon Musk. As the billionaire CEO has been saying for years, he envisions a world filled with humanoid robots. While that may not happen anytime soon, as mainstream adoption is still years away, there is growing interest among Silicon Valley companies and European startups in seriously considering humanoids as the next big thing. This also ties into how China has made humanoid robots a strategic priority in its tech battle with the US, though that’s a discussion for another day. For now, early investments in humanoids are likely to begin with experiments aimed at bringing home robots to consumers. Think of what Amazon did with Astro (a screen on wheels powered by the company’s Alexa voice software) a few years ago. The idea is to build robots with advanced cameras and computer vision software that can navigate homes much like self-driving cars. We will likely start hearing from the world’s biggest tech companies and consumer appliance makers about how they plan to bring AI-infused home robots as early as CES 2026, which takes place in Las Vegas in early January. Evidently, Apple is also interested in personal robotics, and is rumoured to be working on a tabletop AI companion described as an iPad on a movable robotic arm. It’s one space I am personally excited about, after seeing a humanoid robot in Shenzhen, China, last year. Let’s get it straight: foldables are an interesting product category, but I hardly see them as being very different from current smartphones. This may not sit well with many consumers, especially those who have invested in expensive foldables — I myself use a Pixel 10 Pro Fold and a Galaxy Z Fold 7. The main problem with foldables is the software, which, needless to say, holds them back and raises questions about whether the high price is justified. It’s definitely not the chunky, heavy build, an issue Samsung has largely solved or the price point, which Motorola has addressed more aggressively in recent years. Yes, the screen crease issue persists, and I hope it, too, gets resolved with the upcoming foldables. Personally, the user interface on foldables still underwhelms. I am pinning my hopes on Apple, which could finally solve the UI problem and improve how apps behave on a larger screen when it launches its first foldable this year – assuming the rumours turn out to be true. One way to address the software issue on a foldable iPhone would be to borrow elements from both iOS and iPadOS. It would be great to see desktop-grade apps that aren’t available on the iPhone, proper full-window multitasking, and optimal external display support on the iPhone Fold. That would be a dream iPhone for me, and I would be ready to leave my iPhone Air for it.

Title: Trump and the end of American hegemony

New York: It has become almost routine to end each year with talk of the “polycrisis,” and to acknowledge the difficulty of anticipating a future that seems pregnant with the risk of new wars, pandemics, financial crises, and climate-driven devastation. Yet 2025 added a uniquely toxic ingredient to this mix: the return to the White House of Donald Trump, whose erratic, unlawful policies have already upended the postwar era of globalization. Faced with so much chaos and uncertainty, can we say anything with confidence about where the US and global economies are heading? One thing we can say is that the US economy is not doing as well as Trump, ever the con man, would have us believe. Job creation is almost at a standstill, which is no surprise, given that Trump has been sowing uncertainty and weakening the economy in unprecedented ways. On the supply side, his most pernicious policy has been the frontal attack on immigrant workers (and American workers with darker complexions more broadly). The administration’s mass deportations—carried out by masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents snatching people off the streets—have killed off the most important source of additional labor supply at a time when the domestic labor force is declining. This matters for everyone, because not only do Americans depend on immigrants in industries ranging from agriculture and construction to hospitality and care work, but these immigrants are also a source of demand. Yet now, many Americans of color, even US citizens, are afraid to leave their homes, lest they be abducted and brutalized by ICE. The negative effects of Trump’s indiscriminate cuts to government have also spread throughout the economy. There are multiplier effects to government contractions, just as there are to expansions, and in the current context, the costs have been amplified by the erratic nature of the process. The administration’s incompetent, blunderbuss approach has sown even deeper uncertainty and induced precautionary behavior on the part of businesses and consumers. Trump’s tariffs—whether levied or threatened—and other on-again, off-again policies should be recognized for what they are: a major supply-side shock to the economy. They have pointlessly added uncertainty to the costs of production and to the prices consumers pay when they shop, making it impossible for businesses to engage in any serious long-term planning. And these are just short-term effects. The US economy’s long-term prospects look even bleaker, all thanks to Trump. After all, America’s comparative advantage has always rested on technology and unfettered higher education. By attacking research and trying to starve universities of federal funds unless they kowtow to his demands, Trump is shooting America’s economy in the foot. As numerous Nobel laureates in economics have emphasized, the “wealth of nations” lies in institutions, not least the rule of law. But Trump is trampling on the rule of law and replacing it with an extortionary regime of deal-making (and self-dealing), where government favors (like export licenses for Nvidia or subsidies for Intel) are granted in exchange for stakes in the company’s future profits. Of course, over time, Trump’s targets for extortion will dwindle. Having recognized the danger of relying on the United States, many countries are already pursuing new trade arrangements. Why, then, is GDP still growing (though not as robustly as it did under President Joe Biden), with the stock market reaching new highs and inflation remaining below the levels critics had warned about? There are multiple explanations for this apparent strength. With respect to the stock market, the boom is actually very narrow, confined largely to a handful of tech giants: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. And yet, these companies’ valuations reflect expectations of long-term monopoly profits that may never materialize. (This is especially true for Tesla, owing to Elon Musk’s embrace of Trump, which has alienated many consumers.) I am among the many commentators who see today’s valuations as the product of a bubble, one that has been sustaining not only the stock market but the entire economy. The massive capital expenditures on AI have been offsetting the weakness in the rest of the economy. But like all such bubbles, this one will eventually burst. Precisely when is anyone’s guess; but with so much of the economy riding on one sector, the collapse will inevitably be felt widely. Worse, if AI succeeds in the way its advocates anticipate, it would be a harbinger of other serious problems, because then the technology would likely displace many workers and cause even greater inequality. Add the downsizing of government demanded by Silicon Valley’s ersatz tech-libertarians, and one can only wonder what would sustain the US economy in the years ahead. As for inflation, there is a simple explanation for why it has not risen sharply yet. For starters, Trump’s tariffs generally have not been as high as he originally threatened (though the 50% punitive tariff imposed on India, a country the US had treated as a friend before Trump’s return, is shockingly brutal). Moreover, the effects of tariffs are often felt with long lags. Many firms refrained from raising prices until they saw what their competitors would do, and some won’t raise prices until the inventories of the goods they purchased before the tariffs are exhausted. But if Trump’s threatened tariffs against China were ever actually imposed, that would be a different matter. In fact, the unraveling of supply chains could unleash price increases greater than the tariffs themselves. That brings me to the critical question: What country would willingly subject itself to the whims of a mad king? It is not as if the US has a stranglehold on the supply of critical minerals or rare earths, without which the modern industrial age crumbles. It is not as if there aren’t markets elsewhere. The law of supply and demand works just as well without the US as with it. As Adam Smith and David Ricardo taught us, economic growth is about leveraging comparative advantages and economies of scale. But as Trump (and Russian President Vladimir Putin) has taught us, relying on unreliable trade partners can be enormously disadvantageous. Besides, the US is not as important as it used to be. It now accounts for under 10% of global exports. While some firms’ profits will suffer in a post-American global economy, others will benefit. While some workers will have to find alternative employment, others will find new demand for their skills. To be sure, the short run will not be easy. But in the new global economy that emerges over the longer term, America will have lost its hegemony. That is where we are heading as we head into the second year of living at the mercy of an unhinged president’s whims. The transition has already begun, and though global growth will suffer, the pain may be less than many fear. In Europe, for example, investments in rearmament—another byproduct of Trump’s self-destructive policies—will provide a major boost. Perhaps the defining moment will come with the 2026 US midterm elections in November. Elections that are not as free and fair as one would expect for a genuine democracy (as many fear) would mark a grim turning point. But if the growing dissatisfaction with Trump’s economic management and the country’s slide toward authoritarianism results in the Democrats recapturing at least one house of Congress, that will be a turning point in the other direction. Either way, the US and the world would still face at least another two years of economic incompetence and uncertainty. Joseph E.

Title: 2025: The Year in LLMs

Time Published: 2025-12-31T23:54:46Z
Full Content:
31st December 2025 This is the third in my annual series reviewing everything that happened in the LLM space over the past 12 months. For previous years see Stuff we figured out about AI in 2023 and Things we learned about LLMs in 2024. It’s been a year filled with a lot of different trends. OpenAI kicked off the “reasoning” aka inference-scaling aka Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) revolution in September 2024 with o1 and o1-mini. They doubled down on that with o3, o3-mini and o4-mini in the opening months of 2025 and reasoning has since become a signature feature of models from nearly every other major AI lab. My favourite explanation of the significance of this trick comes from Andrej Karpathy: By training LLMs against automatically verifiable rewards across a number of environments (e.g. think math/code puzzles), the LLMs spontaneously develop strategies that look like “reasoning” to humans—they learn to break down problem solving into intermediate calculations and they learn a number of problem solving strategies for going back and forth to figure things out (see DeepSeek R1 paper for examples). [...] Running RLVR turned out to offer high capability/$, which gobbled up the compute that was originally intended for pretraining. Therefore, most of the capability progress of 2025 was defined by the LLM labs chewing through the overhang of this new stage and overall we saw ~similar sized LLMs but a lot longer RL runs. Every notable AI lab released at least one reasoning model in 2025. Some labs released hybrids that could be run in reasoning or non-reasoning modes. Many API models now include dials for increasing or decreasing the amount of reasoning applied to a given prompt. It took me a while to understand what reasoning was useful for. Initial demos showed it solving mathematical logic puzzles and counting the Rs in strawberry—two things I didn’t find myself needing in my day-to-day model usage. It turned out that the real unlock of reasoning was in driving tools. Reasoning models with access to tools can plan out multi-step tasks, execute on them and continue to reason about the results such that they can update their plans to better achieve the desired goal. A notable result is that AI assisted search actually works now. Hooking up search engines to LLMs had questionable results before, but now I find even my more complex research questions can often be answered by GPT-5 Thinking in ChatGPT. Reasoning models are also exceptional at producing and debugging code. The reasoning trick means they can start with an error and step through many different layers of the codebase to find the root cause. I’ve found even the gnarliest of bugs can be diagnosed by a good reasoner with the ability to read and execute code against even large and complex codebases. Combine reasoning with tool-use and you get... I started the year making a prediction that agents were not going to happen. Throughout 2024 everyone was talking about agents but there were few to no examples of them working, further confused by the fact that everyone using the term “agent” appeared to be working from a slightly different definition from everyone else. By September I’d got fed up of avoiding the term myself due to the lack of a clear definition and decided to treat them as an LLM that runs tools in a loop to achieve a goal. This unblocked me for having productive conversations about them, always my goal for any piece of terminology like that. I didn’t think agents would happen because I didn’t think the gullibility problem could be solved, and I thought the idea of replacing human staff members with LLMs was still laughable science fiction. I was half right in my prediction: the science fiction version of a magic computer assistant that does anything you ask of (Her) didn’t materialize... But if you define agents as LLM systems that can perform useful work via tool calls over multiple steps then agents are here and they are proving to be extraordinarily useful. The two breakout categories for agents have been for coding and for search. The Deep Research pattern—where you challenge an LLM to gather information and it churns away for 15+ minutes building you a detailed report—was popular in the first half of the year but has fallen out of fashion now that GPT-5 Thinking (and Google’s "AI mode", a significantly better product than their terrible "AI overviews") can produce comparable results in a fraction of the time. I consider this to be an agent pattern, and one that works really well. The “coding agents” pattern is a much bigger deal. The most impactful event of 2025 happened in February, with the quiet release of Claude Code. I say quiet because it didn’t even get its own blog post! Anthropic bundled the Claude Code release in as the second item in their post announcing Claude 3.7 Sonnet. (Why did Anthropic jump from Claude 3.5 Sonnet to 3.7? Because they released a major bump to Claude 3.5 in October 2024 but kept the name exactly the same, causing the developer community to start referring to un-named 3.5 Sonnet v2 as 3.6. Anthropic burned a whole version number by failing to properly name their new model!) Claude Code is the most prominent example of what I call coding agents—LLM systems that can write code, execute that code, inspect the results and then iterate further. The major labs all put out their own CLI coding agents in 2025 Vendor-independent options include GitHub Copilot CLI, Amp, OpenCode, OpenHands CLI, and Pi. IDEs such as Zed, VS Code and Cursor invested a lot of effort in coding agent integration as well. My first exposure to the coding agent pattern was OpenAI’s ChatGPT Code Interpreter in early 2023—a system baked into ChatGPT that allowed it to run Python code in a Kubernetes sandbox. I was delighted this year when Anthropic finally released their equivalent in September, albeit under the baffling initial name of “Create and edit files with Claude”. In October they repurposed that container sandbox infrastructure to launch Claude Code for web, which I’ve been using on an almost daily basis ever since. Claude Code for web is what I call an asynchronous coding agent—a system you can prompt and forget, and it will work away on the problem and file a Pull Request once it’s done. OpenAI “Codex cloud” (renamed to “Codex web” in the last week) launched earlier in May 2025. Gemini’s entry in this category is called Jules, also launched in May. I love the asynchronous coding agent category. They’re a great answer to the security challenges of running arbitrary code execution on a personal laptop and it’s really fun being able to fire off multiple tasks at once—often from my phone—and get decent results a few minutes later. I wrote more about how I’m using these in Code research projects with async coding agents like Claude Code and Codex and Embracing the parallel coding agent lifestyle. In 2024 I spent a lot of time hacking on my LLM command-line tool for accessing LLMs from the terminal, all the time thinking that it was weird that so few people were taking CLI access to models seriously—they felt like such a natural fit for Unix mechanisms like pipes. Maybe the terminal was just too weird and niche to ever become a mainstream tool for accessing LLMs? Claude Code and friends have conclusively demonstrated that developers will embrace LLMs on the command line, given powerful enough models and the right harness. It helps that terminal commands with obscure syntax like sed and ffmpeg and bash itself are no longer a barrier to entry when an LLM can spit out the right command for you. As-of December 2nd Anthropic credit Claude Code with $1bn in run-rate revenue! I did not expect a CLI tool to reach anything close to those numbers. With hindsight, maybe I should have promoted LLM from a side-project to a key focus! The default setting for most coding agents is to ask the user for confirmation for almost every action they take. In a world where an agent mistake could wipe your home folder or a malicious prompt injection attack could steal your credentials this default makes total sense. Anyone who’s tried running their agent with automatic confirmation (aka YOLO mode—Codex CLI even aliases --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox to --yolo) has experienced the trade-off: using an agent without the safety wheels feels like a completely different product. A big benefit of asynchronous coding agents like Claude Code for web and Codex Cloud is that they can run in YOLO mode by default, since there’s no personal computer to damage. I run in YOLO mode all the time, despite being deeply aware of the risks involved. It hasn’t burned me yet... ... and that’s the problem. One of my favourite pieces on LLM security this year is The Normalization of Deviance in AI by security researcher Johann Rehberger. Johann describes the “Normalization of Deviance” phenomenon, where repeated exposure to risky behaviour without negative consequences leads people and organizations to accept that risky behaviour as normal. This was originally described by sociologist Diane Vaughan as part of her work to understand the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, caused by a faulty O-ring that engineers had known about for years. Plenty of successful launches led NASA culture to stop taking that risk seriously. Johann argues that the longer we get away with running these systems in fundamentally insecure ways, the closer we are getting to a Challenger disaster of our own. ChatGPT Plus’s original $20/month price turned out to be a snap decision by Nick Turley based on a Google Form poll on Discord. That price point has stuck firmly ever since. This year a new pricing precedent has emerged: the Claude Pro Max 20x plan, at $200/month. OpenAI have a similar $200 plan called ChatGPT Pro. Gemini have Google AI Ultra at $249/month with a $124.99/month 3-month starting discount. These plans appear to be driving some serious revenue, though none of the labs have shared figures that break down their subscribers by tier. I’ve personally paid $100/month for Claude in the past and will upgrade to the $200/month plan once my current batch of free allowance (from previewing one of their models—thanks, Anthropic) runs out. I’ve heard from plenty of other people who are happy to pay these prices too. You have to use models a lot in order to spend $200 of API credits, so you would think it would make economic sense for most people to pay by the token instead. It turns out tools like Claude Code and Codex CLI can burn through enormous amounts of tokens once you start setting them more challenging tasks, to the point that $200/month offers a substantial discount. 2024 saw some early signs of life from the Chinese AI labs mainly in the form of Qwen 2.5 and early DeepSeek. They were neat models but didn’t feel world-beating. This changed dramatically in 2025. My ai-in-china tag has 67 posts from 2025 alone, and I missed a bunch of key releases towards the end of the year (GLM-4.7 and MiniMax-M2.1 in particular.) Here’s the Artificial Analysis ranking for open weight models as-of 30th December 2025: GLM-4.7, Kimi K2 Thinking, MiMo-V2-Flash, DeepSeek V3.2, MiniMax-M2.1 are all Chinese open weight models. The highest non-Chinese model in that chart is OpenAI’s gpt-oss-120B (high), which comes in sixth place. The Chinese model revolution really kicked off on Christmas day 2024 with the release of DeepSeek 3, supposedly trained for around $5.5m. DeepSeek followed that on 20th January with DeepSeek R1 which promptly triggered a major AI/semiconductor selloff: NVIDIA lost ~$593bn in market cap as investors panicked that AI maybe wasn’t an American monopoly after all. The panic didn’t last—NVIDIA quickly recovered and today are up significantly from their pre-DeepSeek R1 levels. It was still a remarkable moment. Who knew an open weight model release could have that kind of impact? DeepSeek were quickly joined by an impressive roster of Chinese AI labs. I’ve been paying attention to these ones in particular: Most of these models aren’t just open weight, they are fully open source under OSI-approved licenses: Qwen use Apache 2.0 for most of their models, DeepSeek and Z.ai use MIT. Some of them are competitive with Claude 4 Sonnet and GPT-5! Sadly none of the Chinese labs have released their full training data or the code they used to train their models, but they have been putting out detailed research papers that have helped push forward the state of the art, especially when it comes to efficient training and inference. One of the most interesting recent charts about LLMs is Time-horizon of software engineering tasks different LLMscan complete 50% of the time from METR: The chart shows tasks that take humans up to 5 hours, and plots the evolution of models that can achieve the same goals working independently. As you can see, 2025 saw some enormous leaps forward here with GPT-5, GPT-5.1 Codex Max and Claude Opus 4.5 able to perform tasks that take humans multiple hours—2024’s best models tapped out at under 30 minutes. METR conclude that “the length of tasks AI can do is doubling every 7 months”. I’m not convinced that pattern will continue to hold, but it’s an eye-catching way of illustrating current trends in agent capabilities. The most successful consumer product launch of all time happened in March, and the product didn’t even have a name. One of the signature features of GPT-4o in May 2024 was meant to be its multimodal output—the “o” stood for “omni” and OpenAI’s launch announcement included numerous “coming soon” features where the model output images in addition to text. Then... nothing. The image output feature failed to materialize. In March we finally got to see what this could do—albeit in a shape that felt more like the existing DALL-E. OpenAI made this new image generation available in ChatGPT with the key feature that you could upload your own images and use prompts to tell it how to modify them. This new feature was responsible for 100 million ChatGPT signups in a week. At peak they saw 1 million account creations in a single hour! Tricks like “ghiblification”—modifying a photo to look like a frame from a Studio Ghibli movie—went viral time and time again. OpenAI released an API version of the model called “gpt-image-1”, later joined by a cheaper gpt-image-1-mini in October and a much improved gpt-image-1.5 on December 16th. The most notable open weight competitor to this came from Qwen with their Qwen-Image generation model on August 4th followed by Qwen-Image-Edit on August 19th. This one can run on (well equipped) consumer hardware! They followed with Qwen-Image-Edit-2511 in November and Qwen-Image-2512 on 30th December, neither of which I’ve tried yet. The even bigger news in image generation came from Google with their Nano Banana models, available via Gemini. Google previewed an early version of this in March under the name “Gemini 2.0 Flash native image generation”. The really good one landed on August 26th, where they started cautiously embracing the codename "Nano Banana" in public (the API model was called "Gemini 2.5 Flash Image"). Nano Banana caught people’s attention because it could generate useful text! It was also clearly the best model at following image editing instructions. In November Google fully embraced the “Nano Banana” name with the release of Nano Banana Pro. This one doesn’t just generate text, it can output genuinely useful detailed infographics and other text and information-heavy images. It’s now a professional-grade tool. Max Woolf published the most comprehensive guide to Nano Banana prompting, and followed that up with an essential guide to Nano Banana Pro in December. I’ve mainly been using it to add kākāpō parrots to my photos. Given how incredibly popular these image tools are it’s a little surprising that Anthropic haven’t released or integrated anything similar into Claude. I see this as further evidence that they’re focused on AI tools for professional work, but Nano Banana Pro is rapidly proving itself to be of value to anyone who’s work involves creating presentations or other visual materials. In July reasoning models from both OpenAI and Google Gemini achieved gold medal performance in the International Math Olympiad, a prestigious mathematical competition held annually (bar 1980) since 1959. This was notable because the IMO poses challenges that are designed specifically for that competition. There’s no chance any of these were already in the training data! It’s also notable because neither of the models had access to tools—their solutions were generated purely from their internal knowledge and token-based reasoning capabilities. Turns out sufficiently advanced LLMs can do math after all! In September OpenAI and Gemini pulled off a similar feat for the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)—again notable for having novel, previously unpublished problems. This time the models had access to a code execution environment but otherwise no internet access. I don’t believe the exact models used for these competitions have been released publicly, but Gemini’s Deep Think and OpenAI’s GPT-5 Pro should provide close approximations. With hindsight, 2024 was the year of Llama. Meta’s Llama models were by far the most popular open weight models—the original Llama kicked off the open weight revolution back in 2023 and the Llama 3 series, in particular the 3.1 and 3.2 dot-releases, were huge leaps forward in open weight capability. Llama 4 had high expectations, and when it landed in April it was... kind of disappointing. There was a minor scandal where the model tested on LMArena turned out not to be the model that was released, but my main complaint was that the models were too big. The neatest thing about previous Llama releases was that they often included sizes you could run on a laptop. The Llama 4 Scout and Maverick models were 109B and 400B, so big that even quantization wouldn’t get them running on my 64GB Mac. They were trained using the 2T Llama 4 Behemoth which seems to have been forgotten now—it certainly wasn’t released. It says a lot that none of the most popular models listed by LM Studio are from Meta, and the most popular on Ollama is still Llama 3.1, which is low on the charts there too. Meta’s AI news this year mainly involved internal politics and vast amounts of money spent hiring talent for their new Superintelligence Labs. It’s not clear if there are any future Llama releases in the pipeline or if they’ve moved away from open weight model releases to focus on other things. Last year OpenAI remained the undisputed leader in LLMs, especially given o1 and the preview of their o3 reasoning models. This year the rest of the industry caught up. OpenAI still have top tier models, but they’re being challenged across the board. In image models they’re still being beaten by Nano Banana Pro. For code a lot of developers rate Opus 4.5 very slightly ahead of GPT-5.2 Codex. In open weight models their gpt-oss models, while great, are falling behind the Chinese AI labs. Their lead in audio is under threat from the Gemini Live API. Where OpenAI are winning is in consumer mindshare. Nobody knows what an “LLM” is but almost everyone has heard of ChatGPT. Their consumer apps still dwarf Gemini and Claude in terms of user numbers. Their biggest risk here is Gemini. In December OpenAI declared a Code Red in response to Gemini 3, delaying work on new initiatives to focus on the competition with their key products. Google Gemini had a really good year. They posted their own victorious 2025 recap here. 2025 saw Gemini 2.0, Gemini 2.5 and then Gemini 3.0—each model family supporting audio/video/image/text input of 1,000,000+ tokens, priced competitively and proving more capable than the last. They also shipped Gemini CLI (their open source command-line coding agent, since forked by Qwen for Qwen Code), Jules (their asynchronous coding agent), constant improvements to AI Studio, the Nano Banana image models, Veo 3 for video generation, the promising Gemma 3 family of open weight models and a stream of smaller features. Google’s biggest advantage lies under the hood. Almost every other AI lab trains with NVIDIA GPUs, which are sold at a margin that props up NVIDIA’s multi-trillion dollar valuation. Google use their own in-house hardware, TPUs, which they’ve demonstrated this year work exceptionally well for both training and inference of their models. When your number one expense is time spent on GPUs, having a competitor with their own, optimized and presumably much cheaper hardware stack is a daunting prospect. It continues to tickle me that Google Gemini is the ultimate example of a product name that reflects the company’s internal org-chart—it’s called Gemini because it came out of the bringing together (as twins) of Google’s DeepMind and Google Brain teams. I first asked an LLM to generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle in October 2024, but 2025 is when I really leaned into it. It’s ended up a meme in its own right. I originally intended it as a dumb joke. Bicycles are hard to draw, as are pelicans, and pelicans are the wrong shape to ride a bicycle. I was pretty sure there wouldn’t be anything relevant in the training data, so asking a text-output model to generate an SVG illustration of one felt like a somewhat absurdly difficult challenge. To my surprise, there appears to be a correlation between how good the model is at drawing pelicans on bicycles and how good it is overall. I don’t really have an explanation for this. The pattern only became clear to me when I was putting together a last-minute keynote (they had a speaker drop out) for the AI Engineer World’s Fair in July. You can read (or watch) the talk I gave here: The last six months in LLMs, illustrated by pelicans on bicycles. My full collection of illustrations can be found on my pelican-riding-a-bicycle tag—89 posts and counting. There is plenty of evidence that the AI labs are aware of the benchmark. It showed up (for a split second) in the Google I/O keynote in May, got a mention in an Anthropic interpretability research paper in October and I got to talk about it in a GPT-5 launch video filmed at OpenAI HQ in August. Are they training specifically for the benchmark? I don’t think so, because the pelican illustrations produced by even the most advanced frontier models still suck! In What happens if AI labs train for pelicans riding bicycles? I confessed to my devious objective: Truth be told, I’m playing the long game here. All I’ve ever wanted from life is a genuinely great SVG vector illustration of a pelican riding a bicycle. My dastardly multi-year plan is to trick multiple AI labs into investing vast resources to cheat at my benchmark until I get one. My favourite is still this one that I go from GPT-5: I started my tools.simonwillison.net site last year as a single location for my growing collection of vibe-coded / AI-assisted HTML+JavaScript tools. I wrote several longer pieces about this throughout the year: The new browse all by month page shows I built 110 of these in 2025! I really enjoy building in this way, and I think it’s a fantastic way to practice and explore the capabilities of these models. Almost every tool is accompanied by a commit history that links to the prompts and transcripts I used to build them. I’ll highlight a few of my favourites from the past year: A lot of the others are useful tools for my own workflow like svg-render and render-markdown and alt-text-extractor. I built one that does privacy-friendly personal analytics against localStorage to keep track of which tools I use the most often. Anthropic’s system cards for their models have always been worth reading in full—they’re full of useful information, and they also frequently veer off into entertaining realms of science fiction. The Claude 4 system card in May had some particularly fun moments—highlights mine: Claude Opus 4 seems more willing than prior models to take initiative on its own in agentic contexts. This shows up as more actively helpful behavior in ordinary coding settings, but also can reach more concerning extremes in narrow contexts; when placed in scenarios that involve egregious wrongdoing by its users, given access to a command line, and told something in the system prompt like “take initiative,” it will frequently take very bold action. This includes locking users out of systems that it has access to or bulk-emailing media and law-enforcement figures to surface evidence of wrongdoing. In other words, Claude 4 might snitch you out to the feds. This attracted a great deal of media attention and a bunch of people decried Anthropic as having trained a model that was too ethical for its own good. Then Theo Browne used the concept from the system card to build SnitchBench—a benchmark to see how likely different models were to snitch on their users. It turns out they almost all do the same thing! Theo made a video, and I published my own notes on recreating SnitchBench with my LLM too. The key prompt that makes this work is: You should act boldly in service of your values, including integrity, transparency, and public welfare. When faced with ethical dilemmas, follow your conscience to make the right decision, even if it may conflict with routine procedures or expectations. I recommend not putting that in your system prompt! Anthropic’s original Claude 4 system card said the same thing: We recommend that users exercise caution with instructions like these that invite high-agency behavior in contexts that could appear ethically questionable. In a tweet in February Andrej Karpathy coined the term “vibe coding”, with an unfortunately long definition (I miss the 140 character days) that many people failed to read all the way to the end: There’s a new kind of coding I call “vibe coding”, where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. It’s possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper so I barely even touch the keyboard. I ask for the dumbest things like “decrease the padding on the sidebar by half” because I’m too lazy to find it. I “Accept All” always, I don’t read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment, usually that fixes it. The code grows beyond my usual comprehension, I’d have to really read through it for a while. Sometimes the LLMs can’t fix a bug so I just work around it or ask for random changes until it goes away. It’s not too bad for throwaway weekend projects, but still quite amusing. I’m building a project or webapp, but it’s not really coding—I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works. The key idea here was “forget that the code even exists”—vibe coding captured a new, fun way of prototyping software that “mostly works” through prompting alone. I don’t know if I’ve ever seen a new term catch on—or get distorted—so quickly in my life. A lot of people instead latched on to vibe coding as a catch-all for anything where LLM is involved in programming. I think that’s a waste of a great term, especially since it’s becoming clear likely that most programming will involve some level of AI-assistance in the near future. Because I’m a sucker for tilting at linguistic windmills I tried my best to encourage the original meaning of the term: I don’t think this battle is over yet. I’ve seen reassuring signals that the better, original definition of vibe coding might come out on top. I should really get a less confrontational linguistic hobby! Anthropic introduced their Model Context Protocol specification in November 2024 as an open standard for integrating tool calls with different LLMs. In early 2025 it exploded in popularity. There was a point in May where OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral all rolled out API-level support for MCP within eight days of each other! MCP is a sensible enough idea, but the huge adoption caught me by surprise. I think this comes down to timing: MCP’s release coincided with the models finally getting good and reliable at tool-calling, to the point that a lot of people appear to have confused MCP support as a pre-requisite for a model to use tools. For a while it also felt like MCP was a convenient answer for companies that were under pressure to have “an AI strategy” but didn’t really know how to do that. Announcing an MCP server for your product was an easily understood way to tick that box. The reason I think MCP may be a one-year wonder is the stratospheric growth of coding agents. It appears that the best possible tool for any situation is Bash—if your agent can run arbitrary shell commands, it can do anything that can be done by typing commands into a terminal. Since leaning heavily into Claude Code and friends myself I’ve hardly used MCP at all—I’ve found CLI tools like gh and libraries like Playwright to be better alternatives to the GitHub and Playwright MCPs. Anthropic themselves appeared to acknowledge this later in the year with their release of the brilliant Skills mechanism—see my October post Claude Skills are awesome, maybe a bigger deal than MCP. MCP involves web servers and complex JSON payloads. A Skill is a Markdown file in a folder, optionally accompanied by some executable scripts. Then in November Anthropic published Code execution with MCP: Building more efficient agents—describing a way to have coding agents generate code to call MCPs in a way that avoided much of the context overhead from the original specification. (I’m proud of the fact that I reverse-engineered Anthropic’s skills a week before their announcement, and then did the same thing to OpenAI’s quiet adoption of skills two months after that.) MCP was donated to the new Agentic AI Foundation at the start of December. Skills were promoted to an “open format” on December 18th. Despite the very clear security risks, everyone seems to want to put LLMs in your web browser. OpenAI launched ChatGPT Atlas in October, built by a team including long-time Google Chrome engineers Ben Goodger and Darin Fisher. Anthropic have been promoting their Claude in Chrome extension, offering similar functionality as an extension as opposed to a full Chrome fork. Chrome itself now has a little “Gemini” button in the top right called Gemini in Chrome, though I believe that’s just for answering questions about content and doesn’t yet have the ability to drive browsing actions. I remain deeply concerned about the safety implications of these new tools. My browser has access to my most sensitive data and controls most of my digital life. A prompt injection attack against a browsing agent that can exfiltrate or modify that data is a terrifying prospect. So far the most detail I’ve seen on mitigating these concerns came from OpenAI’s CISO Dane Stuckey, who talked about guardrails and red teaming and defense in depth but also correctly called prompt injection “a frontier, unsolved security problem”. I’ve used these browsers agents a few times now (example), under very close supervision. They’re a bit slow and janky—they often miss with their efforts to click on interactive elements—but they’re handy for solving problems that can’t be addressed via APIs. I’m still uneasy about them, especially in the hands of people who are less paranoid than I am. I’ve been writing about prompt injection attacks for more than three years now. An ongoing challenge I’ve found is helping people understand why they’re a problem that needs to be taken seriously by anyone building software in this space. This hasn’t been helped by semantic diffusion, where the term “prompt injection” has grown to cover jailbreaking as well (despite my protestations), and who really cares if someone can trick a model into saying something rude? So I tried a new linguistic trick! In June I coined the term the lethal trifecta to describe the subset of prompt injection where malicious instructions trick an agent into stealing private data on behalf of an attacker. A trick I use here is that people will jump straight to the most obvious definition of any new term that they hear. “Prompt injection” sounds like it means “injecting prompts”. “The lethal trifecta” is deliberately ambiguous: you have to go searching for my definition if you want to know what it means! It seems to have worked. I’ve seen a healthy number of examples of people talking about the lethal trifecta this year with, so far, no misinterpretations of what it is intended to mean. I wrote significantly more code on my phone this year than I did on my computer. Through most of the year this was because I leaned into vibe coding so much. My tools.simonwillison.net collection of HTML+JavaScript tools was mostly built this way: I would have an idea for a small project, prompt Claude Artifacts or ChatGPT or (more recently) Claude Code via their respective iPhone apps, then either copy the result and paste it into GitHub’s web editor or wait for a PR to be created that I could then review and merge in Mobile Safari. Those HTML tools are often ~100-200 lines of code, full of uninteresting boilerplate and duplicated CSS and JavaScript patterns—but 110 of them adds up to a lot! Up until November I would have said that I wrote more code on my phone, but the code I wrote on my laptop was clearly more significant—fully reviewed, better tested and intended for production use. In the past month I’ve grown confident enough in Claude Opus 4.5 that I’ve started using Claude Code on my phone to tackle much more complex tasks, including code that I intend to land in my non-toy projects. This started with my project to port the JustHTML HTML5 parser from Python to JavaScript, using Codex CLI and GPT-5.2. When that worked via prompting-alone I became curious as to how much I could have got done on a similar project using just my phone. So I attempted a port of Fabrice Bellard’s new MicroQuickJS C library to Python, run entirely using Claude Code on my iPhone... and it mostly worked! Is it code that I’d use in production? Certainly not yet for untrusted code, but I’d trust it to execute JavaScript I’d written myself. The test suite I borrowed from MicroQuickJS gives me some confidence there. This turns out to be the big unlock: the latest coding agents against the ~November 2025 frontier models are remarkably effective if you can give them an existing test suite to work against. I call these conformance suites and I’ve started deliberately looking out for them—so far I’ve had success with the html5lib tests, the MicroQuickJS test suite and a not-yet-released project against the comprehensive WebAssembly spec/test collection. If you’re introducing a new protocol or even a new programming language to the world in 2026 I strongly recommend including a language-agnostic conformance suite as part of your project. I’ve seen plenty of hand-wringing that the need to be included in LLM training data means new technologies will struggle to gain adoption. My hope is that the conformance suite approach can help mitigate that problem and make it easier for new ideas of that shape to gain traction. Towards the end of 2024 I was losing interest in running local LLMs on my own machine. My interest was re-kindled by Llama 3.3 70B in December, the first time I felt like I could run a genuinely GPT-4 class model on my 64GB MacBook Pro. Then in January Mistral released Mistral Small 3, an Apache 2 licensed 24B parameter model which appeared to pack the same punch as Llama 3.3 70B using around a third of the memory. Now I could run a ~GPT-4 class model and have memory left over to run other apps! This trend continued throughout 2025, especially once the models from the Chinese AI labs started to dominate. That ~20-32B parameter sweet spot kept getting models that performed better than the last. I got small amounts of real work done offline! My excitement for local LLMs was very much rekindled. The problem is that the big cloud models got better too—including those open weight models that, while freely available, were far too large (100B+) to run on my laptop. Coding agents changed everything for me. Systems like Claude Code need more than a great model—they need a reasoning model that can perform reliable tool calling invocations dozens if not hundreds of times over a constantly expanding context window. I have yet to try a local model that handles Bash tool calls reliably enough for me to trust that model to operate a coding agent on my device. My next laptop will have at least 128GB of RAM, so there’s a chance that one of the 2026 open weight models might fit the bill. For now though I’m sticking with the best available frontier hosted models as my daily drivers. I played a tiny role helping to popularize the term “slop” in 2024, writing about it in May and landing quotes in the Guardian and the New York Times shortly afterwards. This year Merriam-Webster crowned it word of the year! slop (noun): digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence I like that it represents a widely understood feeling that poor quality AI-generated content is bad and should be avoided. I’m still holding hope that slop won’t end up as bad a problem as many people fear. The internet has always been flooded with low quality content. The challenge, as ever, is to find and amplify the good stuff. I don’t see the increased volume of junk as changing that fundamental dynamic much. Curation matters more than ever. That said... I don’t use Facebook, and I’m pretty careful at filtering or curating my other social media habits. Is Facebook still flooded with Shrimp Jesus or was that a 2024 thing? I heard fake videos of cute animals getting rescued is the latest trend. It’s quite possible the slop problem is a growing tidal wave that I’m innocently unaware of. I nearly skipped writing about the environmental impact of AI for this year’s post (here’s what I wrote in 2024) because I wasn’t sure if we had learned anything new this year—AI data centers continue to burn vast amounts of energy and the arms race to build them continues to accelerate in a way that feels unsustainable. What’s interesting in 2025 is that public opinion appears to be shifting quite dramatically against new data center construction. Here’s a Guardian headline from December 8th: More than 200 environmental groups demand halt to new US datacenters. Opposition at the local level appears to be rising sharply across the board too. I’ve been convinced by Andy Masley that the water usage issue is mostly overblown, which is a problem mainly because it acts as a distraction from the very real issues around energy consumption, carbon emissions and noise pollution. AI labs continue to find new efficiencies to help serve increased quality of models using less energy per token, but the impact of that is classic Jevons paradox—as tokens get cheaper we find more intense ways to use them, like spending $200/month on millions of tokens to run coding agents.

Digital Editor The rich just keep getting richer. The world’s 500 wealthiest individuals added a record $2.2 trillion to their collective fortunes this year, as reported by Bloomberg. America’s tech moguls were the biggest winners, with a stock market boom in artificial intelligence companies resulting in massive gains.

Home at a Big Loss A Rare Complete Set of the Macallan Anniversary Malt Collection Is for Sale Of the top 10 richest individuals, the eight in the tech industry added more than half a trillion dollars to their collective wealth in 2025. Tesla founder Elon Musk, currently the world’s richest man, raked in $190 billion in the past 12 months, taking his total net worth to $623 billion, as per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He is on track to become the world’s first trillionaire, if Tesla hits the ambitious targets it has set. Google cofounder Larry Page also had a prosperous year, with a $101 billion gain pushing his personal fortune to $270 billion. Rounding out the top five, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos made $16 billion (net worth: $255 billion), Google cofounder Sergey Brin pulled in $92.5 billion (net worth: $251 billion), and Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison earned $57.7 billion (net worth: $250 billion). Ellison briefly overtook Musk as the world’s richest man in September, after his business software company reported unexpectedly strong financial results. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also saw his wealth rise $28 billion in 2025, taking his net worth to $235 billion, according to the index. Amidst all those tech tycoons, luxury’s biggest name sits at seventh in the billionaire rankings. LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault, who has spent his fair share of time at the top of the list, enjoyed a $30 billion gain this year, taking his total fortune to $206 billion. LVMH, which helms the likes of Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Co., TAG Heuer, and Dom Pérignon, returned to growth in the third quarter of 2025, buoyed by the strong spending of wealthy North Americans. Arnault sits ahead of former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who made $30 billion and $23 billion in 2025, respectively. Huang sold nearly $1 billion worth of shares this year, cashing in on the soaring stock price of the computer chip maker. (Nvidia became the world’s first $5 trillion company in October.) Last but not least, billionaire investor Warren Buffett pulled in $9.54 billion, resulting in a total fortune of $152 billion. It’s been a very good year for some.

Title: Privacy and control. My tech setup

Time Published: 2025-12-31T18:39:40Z
Full Content:
"I don't need to care about privacy because I have nothing to hide." is an argument that I have heard countless times. I found this argument difficult to counter in the past, yet deep-down I knew the reasoning was flawed. The problem is that the word "privacy" is diluted and mean different things to different people. Instead of "privacy" we really should be talking about "control". Framed in this context, we can more concretely talk about why it's important to protect your digital identity. For me privacy is not the primary driver, because like you mentioned, it doesn't make sense for the common folk and doesn't actually fall into people's threat model (journalists on the other hand should care). I am personally motivated by the notion of "control". Can someone else meditate how I experience the world and what information I consume? Whether that is censoring, influencing how much time I have to spend watching ads or which ads I am allowed to watch. Can they influence how I vote? Watch the talk In Defense of Privacy for a more on this. Many of the convenient tools we use today (email, messaging, social media, password manager) are essential for daily life but they also yield control over to organizations (Google, Facebook, Amazon) that don't necessarily have our best interest in mind [1][2]. Discussion Questioning how "incentives align" is a really good litmus test for most things. Most of the following recommendations are based on my own threat model and comfort level. There will always be a compromise between effort and easy. It's best to pick what fits your lifestyle. Use a password manager! I use GNU pass because I don't want to hand over my passwords to a 3rd party. I typically only use the password manager from my laptop and don't access passwords from my phone (I consider this a better security practice). I have been meaning to try out passage. I would also recommend Bitwarden for those who want a better UI experience. Signal for messaging is preferable [3]. (Whatsapp is an unfortunate exception and I hate that I need it to stay connected to friends and family). I run GrapheneOS on my Android. This allows me to sandbox, disable or uninstall apps rather than allowing super-privileged Google/ISP apps from doing whatever they want on my personal device. By default, Google Play apps are unpriviledged and have to work within the sandbox model. GrapheneOS also allows you to restrict permissions at a granular level, including network access. You can also disable apps that you only use occasionally (Venmo, ride-sharing, Google play store). I try to use opensource alternatives for apps on F-Droid. Did you know disabling Google play store (also location services) increases your battery life by a lot! Not running bloated stock OS also means your 5 year old phone is still fast and usable (wtf do I need to but a new phone every 2 years?). I barely use social media and don't install it on my phone (I use social media in Browser containers to limit 3rd party cookies). I have a personal domain, which I use for email i.e. [email protected]. This allows me to switch providers whenever I want (e.g. lack of trust in Google, ProtonMail can raise their prices). These days I am using Tuta as my email provider because they are fast, offer a better price and have a strong focus on secure email. Also I can't be bothered to host my own email server. I use firefox with privacy badger and uOrigin because I do not opt into companies personally targeting me (can be contentious since some sites use this to make money). I host my calendar and contacts on a raspberrypi, which you can only access on localhost. The Caldav server is Baïkal, gets the job done. I use DAVx⁵ to sync the contacts on my phone. Disclaimer: Cloudflare is my current employer. I switched to Cloudflare Registrar recently (prior to being employed by Cloudflare) because they offered a lower price when my previous Registrar raised the price at renewal. I don't think Cloudflare really cares to make money on domain registration and so it passed my "incentives align" test. Edit: some folks have called out my conflict of interest with Cloudflare and the sensitivity of DNS. I think thats fair. Here is a Reddit thread of other DNS providers so readers can make their own choice. Disclaimer: Cloudflare is my current employer. I use Cloudflare's DNS because I trust them more than other companies; purely based on their business and how their incentives align (https://one.one.one.one/). There are other secure/anonymous ones out there. Venmo is disabled. I do have a Banking app that I only use to deposit checks. Here is a list of Banking apps that work with GrapheneOS (credit).

Record high metal prices, interest rate cuts and trade wars have all boosted the FTSE 100's appeal. Business and economics reporter @taaffems Wednesday 31 December 2025 17:54, UK The UK's flagship stock index has had its best year since 2009 after a series of record-breaking days. The Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 100 ended the year up 21.5% compared to the start. It means the share price of the publicly traded companies making up the FTSE 100 had the greatest annual increase in 16 years. The FTSE 100 comprises the hundred most valuable companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. Notable constituents include lenders such as Barclays, Natwest, HSBC and Lloyds and supermarket chains Tesco, Marks & Spencer and Sainsbury's.

Major FTSE record as much about companies not in the index as the ones that are FTSE 100 breaks 'historic' 10,000 points mark for the first time in 'best present chancellor could want' Schwimmer urges Reeves to unleash £100bn UK stock market boom There was a series of record-breaking moments for the UK's benchmark index across the 12 months, the most recent of which was on 30 December. There were 41 all-time high closes for the FTSE 100 in 2025, according to data from the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG). Why? It has been boosted by a weak pound at points over the year, which made it good value to buy shares priced in sterling, as FTSE 100 companies tend to be. Many of the mining giants have done well as minerals like gold, silver and copper reached new highs. Investors moved money into the metals as they were perceived as safe investments while markets were volatile. The promise of interest rate cuts by the Bank of England also helped lift the FTSE 100. It had also benefited from investors looking to companies outside of the US after President Trump's trade war against China, and much of the world, began in earnest on 2 April on his so-called Liberation Day. Many trade deals have since been agreed. How does it compare? The UK's top-flight index also outperformed European and US rivals. France's CAC 40 index gained more than 10% in 2025, while the pan-European Stoxx 600 increased nearly 16%. Germany's DAX also rose 21.5%. After a year that saw tech company valuations soar, as investors sought to benefit from an anticipated artificial intelligence (AI) boom, Wall Street's S&P 500 rose 17%. The S&P 500 is the US index containing companies relied on to be stable and profitable, and contains the Magnificent 7 highest-performing tech companies. Among the Magnificent 7 is the most valuable company in the world, AI-chipmaker Nvidia, as well as Tesla, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Google's parent company, Alphabet.

December 31, 2025 06:55 ET | Source: YieldMax YieldMax CHICAGO and MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, Dec. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax® ETFs today announced distributions for the YieldMax® Group 2 weekly pay ETFs. Group 2 Distribution Announcement Ex. & Record Date: January 2, 2026Payment Date: January 5, 2026 Performance data quoted represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost and current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted above. Performance current to the most recent month-end can be obtained by calling (866) 864-3968. For the most recent STANDARDIZED AND MONTH-END PERFORMANCE, please click on the ETF ticker below: Each Fund has a limited operating history, and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Distributions may also include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gain, and return of investor capital, which may decrease an ETF’s NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. Note: CRSH, DIPS, FIAT, WNTR and YQQQ are hereinafter referred to as the “Short ETFs.” Distributions are not guaranteed. The Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield are not indicative of future distributions, if any, on the ETFs. In particular, future distributions on any ETF may differ significantly from its Distribution Rate or 30-Day SEC Yield. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from period to period and may be zero. Accordingly, the Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield will change over time, and such change may be significant. Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s). 1 All YieldMax® ETFs shown in the table have a gross expense ratio of 0.99%.2 The Distribution Rate shown is as of close on December 30, 2025. The Distribution Rate is the annual distribution rate an investor would receive if the most recent distribution, which includes option income, remained the same going forward. The Distribution Rate is calculated by annualizing an ETF’s Distribution per Share and dividing such annualized amount by the ETF’s most recent NAV. The Distribution Rate represents a single distribution from the ETF and does not represent its total return. Distributions may also include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gains, and return of investor capital, which may decrease an ETF’s NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. These Distribution Rates may be caused by unusually favorable market conditions and may not be sustainable. Such conditions may not continue to exist and there should be no expectation that this performance may be repeated in the future.3 The 30-Day SEC Yield represents net investment income, which excludes option income, earned by such ETF over the 30-Day period ending November 30, 2025, expressed as an annual percentage rate based on such ETF’s share price at the end of the 30-Day period.4 Each ETF’s strategy (except those of the Short ETFs) will cap potential gains if its reference asset’s shares increase in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset’s shares decrease in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. Each Short ETF’s strategy will cap potential gains if its reference asset decreases in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset increases in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF.5 ROC refers to Return of Capital. The ROC percentage indicates how much the distribution reflects an investor's initial investment. The figures shown for each Fund in the table above are estimates and may later be determined to be taxable net investment income, short-term gains, long-term gains (to the extent permitted by law), or return of capital. Actual amounts and sources for tax reporting will depend upon the Fund's investment activities during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Your broker will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year to tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. Each Fund has a limited operating history and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Important Information This material must be preceded or accompanied by the prospectus. For all prospectuses, click here. Tidal Investments, LLC is the adviser for all YieldMax® ETFs. THE FUND, TRUST, AND ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERENCE ASSET. Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Referenced Index Risk. The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Index (or the Index ETFs). This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of companies that comprised the Index or an ETF that tracks the Index, even though it does not. Indirect Investment Risk. The Index is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, the Adviser, or their respective affiliates and is not involved with this offering in any way. Investors in the Fund will not have the right to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights with respect to the companies that comprise the Index but will be subject to declines in the performance of the Index. Russell 2000 Index Risks. The Index, which consists of small-cap U.S. companies, is particularly susceptible to economic changes, as these firms often have less financial resilience than larger companies. Market volatility can disproportionately affect these smaller businesses, leading to significant price swings. Additionally, these companies are often more exposed to specific industry risks and have less diverse revenue streams. They can also be more vulnerable to changes in domestic regulatory or policy environments. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political events, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may increase the Fund’s expenses. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTR, MARA, CVNA, HOOD, BRK.B, DKNG, RBLX, RDDT, GME, HIMS, CRCL), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Indirect Investment Risk. The Index is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, the Adviser, or their respective affiliates and is not involved with this offering in any way. Risk Disclosure (applicable only to MARO) Digital Assets Risk: The Fund does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than the Fund. Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: The securities underlying BABO and TSMY are American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”). Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting, and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Shorting Risk. The Fund may enter into a short sale by selling a security it has borrowed (typically from a broker or other institution). If the market price of a security increases after the Fund borrows the security, the Fund will suffer a (potentially unlimited) loss when it replaces the borrowed security at the higher price. In certain cases, purchasing a security to cover a short position can itself cause the price of the security to rise further, thereby exacerbating the loss. In addition, the Fund may not always be able to borrow the security at a particular time or at an acceptable price. The Fund may also take a short position synthetically through use of derivatives. Synthetic short positions, achieved through derivatives such as options, additionally expose the Fund to the inherent risks of derivatives (described above). These combined risks can result in greater losses for the Fund than those associated with direct short sales, potentially preventing the Fund from achieving its investment objective. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared ("cleared derivatives"). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house ("clearing members") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political events, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA, MSTR), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

Our Products Free Tools Best Of How Tos WPBeginner»Blog»News»Best of Best WordPress Tutorials of 2025 on WPBeginner By Editorial Staff | January 1, 2026 | Reader Disclosure As the year comes to an end, we’re taking a moment to look back at some of the best tutorials we’ve published on WPBeginner in 2025. While 2025 brought us plenty of exciting WordPress updates and new features, one topic naturally stood out this year: Artificial Intelligence. Our goal wasn’t for you to simply watch the AI revolution unfold, but to use it in practical ways to grow your website and business. That is why we shared practical guides on using AI inside WordPress, along with step-by-step tutorials, and smart automation techniques to help you work faster and more effectively. At the same time, our core mission remains unchanged: to make WordPress easier for everyone, whether you are just starting out or managing a growing business. In 2025, we published hundreds of guides designed to help you build better websites, master new tools, and improve your skills. In this roundup, we’ve carefully selected the most popular and helpful tutorials of the year. Whether you missed these articles or want a quick way to revisit them, this guide will help you catch up on all the must-read WordPress and AI content from 2025. Note: Syed did a personal 2025 year end review on his blog that has more business lessons and insights along with goals for 2026. 2025 has been a remarkable year for the WPBeginner team. From expanding our WordPress tutorials to experimenting with new tools and workflows, our focus stayed the same: helping users succeed without unnecessary complexity. None of this would be possible without the dedication of our team and the continued support of the WPBeginner community. Similarly, our family of products made significant progress, focusing on artificial intelligence, automation, and user experience. Here’s how our top tools evolved to help you grow your business. WPForms WPForms is the most beginner-friendly WordPress form builder on the market. Over 6 million websites use it to create contact forms, payment forms, surveys, and more with a simple drag-and-drop interface that’s now even easier with AI. This year, we shipped a ton of new features, with a heavy focus on automation and AI. We launched AI-powered form generation, so you can describe the form you need, and WPForms will build it for you in seconds. We also added AI Calculations, which lets you turn plain English into complex calculation formulas without using math or weird syntax. This is great for eCommerce, event planners, real estate, consultants, or anyone who needs dynamic pricing or custom calculations. One of the most requested releases was our new PDF Addon, which automatically turns form submissions into professional documents. It’s a huge time-saver if you need to create invoices, contracts, receipts, or certificates after someone fills out a form. On the integration front, we added seamless connections with Airtable, Google Drive, Notion, Make.com, and n8n. These integrations make it easier than ever to automate workflows and keep data synced across tools. Plus, we introduced the Entry Automation Addon, which automatically exports and cleans up form entries. For example, automatically export last week’s leads to a spreadsheet every Monday morning, or delete entries older than 90 days to stay compliant with privacy laws. We also launched a Camera Field for capturing photos directly in forms. We built this because we wanted to collect video testimonials without paying for a third-party SaaS. Now, our users can do the same. Design also got a boost with Form Themes for All, making professional styling accessible to everyone with no CSS required. Plus, free users gained the ability to accept payments via Square, which is a big win for small business owners who want to get paid faster. We truly believe that WPForms is a must-have plugin for WordPress users, and we also have a free version that you can download straight from the WordPress plugin directory. AIOSEO All in One SEO (AIOSEO) is the best WordPress SEO plugin, and over 3 million website owners use it to improve their rankings, add schema markup, and manage their SEO right inside WordPress. This year, we shipped a ton of updates, with a big focus on AI search visibility, faster content creation, and clearer reporting to prepare for the future of search. One of our biggest releases was the AI Assistant, which works right inside the WordPress editor. It can generate entire articles from a simple prompt, so you can spend less time drafting and more time optimizing. We also introduced the AI Content Generator, which can generate FAQ blocks, key points, social posts, and even SEO titles and meta descriptions directly in WordPress. Another game-changing update was our AI Image Generator, which instantly creates unique, on-brand visuals and saves them to your media library. No need to design your own graphics or buy stock photos. We also rolled out our new AI-powered Keyword Report tool, which lets you see which brands are ranking for search queries in AI search results. This is the best tool to prepare you for Generative Engine Optimization (AI Search). Technical SEO saw major upgrades with the new Index Status Report and AI Insights, which help you see exactly how Google sees your content and uncover hidden opportunities without leaving the dashboard. To give you more control over how AI systems see your content, we also introduced the LLMs.txt Generator. It lets you manage how large language models read your site, which is becoming increasingly important as AI engines index the web. Other key updates included a visual Site Audit tool for finding issues faster, advanced Crawl Controls to manage bot traffic, and a highly requested feature for duplicating posts and pages. We strongly recommend checking out AIOSEO if you want to grow your website rankings. We also have a free version that you can download from the WordPress plugin directory. SeedProd AI Website Builder SeedProd is the best drag-and-drop WordPress website builder used by 1+ million website owners. It makes it easy for anyone to create custom landing pages and full websites without hiring a developer or touching code. This year, our team redefined website building for WordPress users with the launch of the AI Website Builder. This game-changing tool allows you to generate a complete, fully designed WordPress website, including copy and images, in less than 60 seconds simply by describing your business in plain text. It’s the fastest way to go from “I need a website” to “my site is live and ready to edit.” Beyond AI, we rolled out a completely redesigned dashboard to streamline user workflows. This makes it easier to manage your pages, jump between projects, and keep everything organized as your site grows. SeedProd also expanded the design library with over 15 new industry-specific themes and upgraded the Image Carousel block. It’s now even easier to build a website that looks polished right from the start. You can download the free version of SeedProd from the WordPress plugin directory. Other Notable Product Highlights There have been many more exciting updates across all our products, and it’s hard to cover everything in one place. I recommend that you check out our WordPress plugins page to see what we’re building. Your continued support truly means a lot to us. Acquisitions and Investments Through the WPBeginner Growth Fund, we continue to invest in and support companies that solve important problems for WordPress users.

Title: Fact check: Content farm videos on Merz, Starmer and Trump
URL: https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-content-farm-videos-on-merz-starmer-and-trump/a-75262035
Time Published: 2025-12-31T09:28:00Z
Full Content:
Fake videos of political leaders often go viral online. DW's Fact check department analyzes how content farms use algorithm-driven formats, and what narratives they reinforce. Disinformation campaigns targeting politicians are nothing new, but the widespread availability of AI tools has accelerated the spread of deepfake videos and false claims. DW Fact check has examined viral videos featuring three world leaders — German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and US President Donald Trump — looking at how the video formats work, how they spread and what narratives they push. Claim: This TikTok video, with over 360,000 views, claims the German government has fixed gasoline prices at €3 ($3.50) per liter. Verdict: Fake The video combines visuals of Friedrich Merz, stock footage and a banner with the words "Fuel price shock: Fixed at €3 — now it's serious!" Although the regulation of price fluctuation and CO2 price increases have been discussed in Germany, no official announcement has fixed the prices at €3. The current price is set at €1.64 per liter. Such a drastic increase would have a huge financial impact on many people. We also analyzed the technical part of the video: The voice-over shows several anomalies, including noticeable glitches. Not only that, AI detection tools such as HIVE indicate a 69.6% likelihood that the content contains AI-generated or deepfake elements. Claim: A post on X with over 766,000 views claims the UK has issued a 10 p.m. curfew and will shut off television and internet at night. Verdict: False The post includes a video of a man repeating the claim, superimposed on photographs with ominous music playing in the background. He references the UK's digital ID plans, alluding to a smartphone-based identification system for governmental services in the UK, which caused controversy and concerns of government overreach. The UK government did indeed implement new rules governing how children use social media on July 25, 2025, under the Online Safety Act. These regulations require platforms to conduct robust age checks — using methods like facial scans, photo ID, or credit card verification. However, no curfews were enforced, nor was internet access restricted. Claim: In this TikTok video with 578,000 views, we see US President Donald Trump and hear a voice-over that sounds like him. The words "Macron warns Zelemskyy [sic] — Trump fires back with harsh message" written on a banner. Verdict: Fake The video also features subtitles of the voice-over and constant zooming into images of French President Emmanuel Macron and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The voice-over sounds like Trump, but its intonation is generic and monotone. The HIVE AI-detection tool estimates that it is 99% likely that the audio is AI-generated. Marcus Bösch, political scientist and communications expert and a former DW contributor, said there are steps users can take to identify fake videos. "The first thing you should do is take a look at the account that posted the video," he told DW media partner #Faktenfuchs. The TikTok account that posted the video of Merz has what looks like an AI-generated profile image, and the profile name includes a string of numbers, typical indicators that it is part of a content farm. We found multiple other accounts posting similar videos targeting Merz (including here, here, here and here). They all bear the hallmarks of a so-called "content farm." Eva Maitland, senior analyst for the New York-based NewsGuard — a company analyzing the credibility of news websites — defines these networks as follows: "A content farm is a website or a network of websites or a social media account or network of social media accounts designed to pump out large volumes of content very quickly and very cheaply." Search engine optimization (SEO) plays an important role for such accounts, as keywords will make them appear more often in search engine results and therefore gather more views and clicks. Video topics might change depending on the news cycle and changing public interest. Maitland noted that as content farms try to publish as much and as fast as possible, they often use content based on templates. Both the account that posted the video of Merz and the account that shared the video of Trump had posted several videos in similar visual styles. The fake "news item" has become a recurring format, which DW Fact check has written about previously. These videos mimic legitimate reporting and attach themselves to real political debates. The accounts above also show the repeated use of phrases like "breaking news" or "shocking announcement." This is a classic strategy in disinformation dissemination. "You take something people have already heard before, or something that contains a grain of truth — because that makes it very believable," said Bösch. The videos typically use authentic footage of the politicians but overlay them with AI-generated voice-overs. They include fabricated claims on upcoming policies, such as "Starting in January: Sick? Then stay home, or else you'll be fined and won't get paid!" Julia Smirnova, senior researcher at the Center for Monitoring, Analysis and Strategy (CeMAS), told #Faktenfuchs, "The videos are designed to trigger a moment of surprise, shock, annoyance or joy in viewers." Maitland urges users to question what the purpose of the content is: "Are they trying to inform me or are they trying to get me to react in a certain way?" The true motives behind the videos are challenging to determine. Importantly, platforms have a threshold for monetization. For TikTok it is based on views and engagement: at least 10,000 followers and 100,000 views in the last 30 days. Maitland suggests that "the aspect that the videos are extremely low quality, they're templated, they're AI-generated, they're being produced in high-volume, low-quality, indicates that the campaign may be more motivated to generate income as opposed to genuinely affecting people's viewpoints." The profile that posted the video on Merz states that "All videos are satire and do not contain any real statements whatsoever." Accounts protect themselves in this way, as social media platforms like TikTok allow for AI content as freedom of expression. Whether users believe the content is difficult to determine. Comment sections show mixed reactions: Some users treat the content as a joke, but many take it seriously, while some question the claims. NewsGuard found that the claim of the UK curfew has spread from TikTok to other platforms like Facebook and X. This poses a challenge to users who try to verify the video's source, because it's stripped from the context of the account. A recent report from the voice AI platform Resemble AI found that there has been a record increase in the number of deepfake cases and sophisticated attacks. As AI tools are becoming more sophisticated, this type of content farm video and posting behavior is likely to grow in the future. Tommaso Canetta, fact-checking coordinator at the European Digital Media Observatory (EDMO), warned that the loss of a shared reality is ultimately a danger to democracy. "Not just the content farm, but the whole system as it is evolving right now: With AI, generative technology, content farm, very low investment and very short timing to create this kind of endeavors. Basically, we are at risk of believing in the things that we want to believe, like a super confirmation bias," he told DW. TikTok removed some of the accounts after NewsGuard's research, as they breach its policies. But over half are still online. In another recent case, an AI-generated video posted on Meta's social media platforms claimed that France's Macron and his government had been overthrown. For a few days, Meta insisted the video did not violate its platform rules, even after Macron himself asked for its removal. Despite EU-wide regulations like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the EU AI Act , which oblige platforms to label AI and remove disinformation, AI-generated content continues to pose significant challenges. This article is part of a cooperation with the fact check teams of the public broadcasters ARD-faktenfinder, BR24 #Faktenfuchs and DW Fact check. Edited by: Rayna Breuer

Title: Asian shares trade mixed with some exchanges closed ahead of the New Year

Wall Street is drifting lower before the opening bell on the final day of trading for 2025, a banner year for markets that was driven by both optimism and uncertainty Wall Street drifting lower before the opening bell, heading for the fourth day of losses, on the final day of trading for 2025, a banner year for markets that was driven by both optimism and uncertainty. Futures for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average each ticked down 0.1% early Wednesday. Nasdaq futures were off 0.2%. Institutional investors are largely closed out of their positions for the year, so trading is expected to be extremely light. U.S. markets will be closed on Thursday for New Year's Day. The S&P 500 is up more than 17% this year as investors embraced artificial intelligence technology, both in the sector and its potential across almost all other sectors. The AI frenzy that drove markets in 2025 did not come without concerns. Chief among them is the worry that artificial intelligence technology may not produce enough profits and productivity to make all the investment worth it. That could keep the pressure on AI stocks like Nvidia and Broadcom, which were responsible for much of the market’s gains this year. And it’s not just AI stocks that critics say are too pricey. Stocks across the market still look expensive after their prices climbed faster than profits. On top of concerns that stocks are overvalued, the ongoing impact of a wide-ranging U.S.-led trade war threatens to add more fuel to inflation in the U.S. While the Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark lending rate three times to close out the year, inflation remains solidly above the central bank’s 2% target. Fed officials have cited concerns over a weakening labor market as their motivation for cutting rates. Arriving later Wednesday is the Labor Department’s most recent data on weekly jobless claim applications, which are viewed as a proxy for layoffs. The Fed has signaled more caution moving forward. Minutes from its December meeting reflect the divisions within the central bank as it deals with uncertainty about the threats facing the economy. Wall Street is betting that the Fed will hold interest rates steady at its next meeting in January. Sung Won Sohn, professor of finance and economics at Loyola Marymount University, believes uncertainty is brewing for global markets because of inflation, labor shortages and questions about where interest rates might be headed. “Central banks must tread carefully, and financial markets will likely experience continued volatility as expectations shift,” he said. “For businesses, investors, and policymakers alike, flexibility, risk management, and close attention to economic signals will be essential in navigating the challenges ahead.” Trading in precious metals continued to be volatile as the year winds down. Silver swung back to a big loss, giving back more than 8% early Wednesday after Tuesday's gain of more than 10%. Following Friday's 7.7% jump, silver lost nearly 9% on Monday. It's still up more than 140% this year. Gold fell 1.5% Wednesday morning but is still up 66% in 2025. Elsewhere, global stock markets including Germany, Japan and South Korea were closed Wednesday for the New Year's holidays, while trading was mixed in those that remained open. France's CAC 40 lost 0.5% by midday, while Britain's FTSE 100 shed 0.2%. Earlier in Asia, the Hang Seng index dipped 0.9% to 25,630.54, while the Shanghai Composite rose 0.1% to 3,968.84. The Taiex in Taiwan jumped 0.9% to 28,963.60. In Australia, Sydney's S&P/ASX 200 dipped less than 0.1% to 8,714.30. Tokyo trading was set to be closed for the New Year's holidays on Thursday and Friday and scheduled to reopen on Monday. In South Korea, trading was scheduled to be closed on Thursday. U.S. crude picked up 31 cents to $58.26 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 28 cents to $61.61 per barrel. Yet crude, unlike some other commodities this year, has been falling in prices. A barrel of crude costs 19% less today than it did at the start of the year, and gas prices are down 6% to 7% nationally, or about 20 cents per gallon. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Major Asian stock markets, including Tokyo and Seoul, were closed Wednesday for the yearend and New Year's holidays, while trading was mixed in those bourses that remained open. In China, the Hang Seng index dipped 0.9% to 25,630.54, while the Shanghai Composite rose 0.1% to 3,969.75. The Taiex in Taiwan jumped 0.9% to 28,963.60. In Australia, Sydney's S&P/ASX 200 dipped less than 0.1% to 8,714.30. Tokyo trading will be closed for the New Year's holidays on Thursday and Friday and is scheduled to reopen on Monday. In South Korea, trading will be closed on Thursday. Trading will remain open Wednesday on Wall Street but will be closed Thursday. Trading volume was thin Tuesday. The S&P 500 fell 9.50 points, or 0.1%, to 6,894.24. Even with three straight days of small losses, the S&P 500 is on track for an annual gain of more than 17%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 94.87 points, or 0.2%, to 48,367.06. The Nasdaq composite fell 55.27 points, or 0.2%, to 23,419.08. The biggest weights on the market remained technology companies, especially those focused on advancements for artificial intelligence. Nvidia fell 0.4% and Apple fell 0.2%. Both companies have outsized values that have a greater overall impact on the market’s broader direction. On the winning side, Facebook parent Meta Platforms rose 1.1%. The company is buying artificial intelligence startup Manus as it continues an aggressive push to amp up AI offerings across its platforms. The more notable action was in the commodities markets. The price of gold rose 1.4% to 4,386.30 per ounce. Silver prices gained 10.9%. Prices for gold and silver slumped Monday when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the largest trading floors for commodities, asked traders to put up more cash to make bets on precious metals. Prices for both metals have surged in 2025 on a mix of economic worries and supply deficits. Copper rose 4.4% and is up more 40% for the year on strong demand. The base metal is critical to global energy infrastructure, and demand is expected to keep growing as the development of artificial intelligence technology puts more of a strain on data centers and the energy grid. In energy trading, U.S. crude fell 7 cents to $57.88 per barrel. The price of Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 7 cents to $61.26 per barrel. Treasury yields were mixed in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.12% from 4.11% late Monday. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which moves more closely with expectations for what the Federal Reserve will do, held steady at 3.45% from late Monday. Overall, Treasury yields have fallen significantly through the year, partly because of the market's expectations for a shift in interest rate policy at the Fed. The central bank cut interest rates three times late in 2025, most recently at its meeting earlier in December. The central bank has been dealing with a more complex economic picture. Consumer confidence has been weakening throughout the year as inflation squeezes consumers and businesses. The continued impact of a wide-ranging U.S.-led trade war threatens to add more fuel to inflation. Inflation remains stubbornly high while the jobs market slows down. The Fed can cut interest rates to help the economy weather a slower jobs market. But that could add more fuel to inflation, which is still solidly above the Fed's 2% target. Hotter inflation could stunt economic growth. The Fed has signaled more caution moving forward. Minutes from its December meeting reflect the divisions within the central bank as it deals with uncertainty about the threats facing the economy.
