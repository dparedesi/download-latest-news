In March, the AI cloud infrastructure provider went public in one of the biggest and most anticipated IPOs of the year that didn’t live up to its hype. Another setback took place in October, when a planned acquisition of the cloud provider’s business partner, Core Scientific, faltered due to skepticism from the acquisition target’s shareholders. In the meantime, the firm has acquired a number of different companies, its stock has gone up and down, and it’s been both criticized and lauded for its role in the booming AI data center market. In an interview at the Fortune Brainstorm AI summit in San Francisco on Tuesday, CoreWeave’s co-founder and CEO, Michael Intrator, defended his company’s performance from critics, noting that it was in the midst of creating a “new business model” for how cloud computing can be built and run. Their collection of Nvidia GPUs is so valuable, they borrow against it to help finance their business. The executive seemed to imply: If you’re charting a new path, you’re destined to encounter some road bumps along the way. “I think people are myopic a lot of times,” Intrator said when questioned about his company’s occasionally unstable stock price. “Yes, it is seesawing,” he admitted, while noting that the CoreWeave IPO took place not long before President Trump’s tariffs went into effect — a notably uncertain moment for the overall economy. “We came out into one of the most challenging environments, right around Liberation Day and, in spite of the incredible headwinds, were able to launch a successful IPO,” the CEO told Brainstorm editorial director Andrew Nusca. “I couldn’t be prouder of what the company has accomplished,” he added. CoreWeave’s stock may have debuted amid the economic doldrums of March but its price has gone on quite the journey since then. It debuted at $40 and, over the past eight months, has climbed to well over $150, but currently rests at around $90. Its more wary critics have compared it to a meme stock due to its penchant for going up and down. Some of the uncertainty around CoreWeave’s stock has been credited to the company’s hefty level of debt. Not long after CoreWeave announced a deal on Monday to issue even more debt to finance its data center buildout, its stock dropped some 8%. Intrator seems to see his company as a disruptor, one whose unconventional tactics may take some getting used to. “When you introduce a new model, when you introduce a new way of doing business, when you disrupt what has been a static environment, it’s going to take some people some time,” he said during his appearance Tuesday. CoreWeave actually started its corporate life as a crypto miner but in short order built itself into a pivotal provider of “AI infrastructure” to some of the tech industry’s most major players. In that role, it provides GPUs to AI developers and has made major partnerships with Microsoft, OpenAI, Nvidia, Meta, and other tech titans. Another topic broached Tuesday was the notion of “circularity” within the AI industry. “Circular” business deals, in which a small number of powerful AI companies invest in one another, have frequently been criticized and have raised questions about the industry’s long-term economic stability. Perhaps not surprisingly, since Nvidia is one of its investors and its supplier of GPUs, Intrator swatted away such concerns. “Companies are trying to address a violent change in supply and demand,” he said. “You do that by working together.” Since the IPO, CoreWeave has continued to make efforts to expand its business. After it acquired Weights & Biases, an AI developer platform, in March, it went on to acquire OpenPipe, a startup that helps companies create and deploy AI agents through reinforcement learning. In October, it also made deals to acquire Marimo (the creator of an open source notebook) and Monolith, another AI company. It also recently announced an expansion of its cloud partnership with OpenAI and said it has plans to move into the federal market, where it wants to provide cloud infrastructure to U.S. government agencies and the defense industrial base.

Title: CoreWeave CEO: Despite see-sawing stock, IPO was ‘incredibly successful’ after challenges of Liberation Day tariff timing

CoreWeave has been rocked by dizzying stock swings—with its shares currently trading 52% below their post-IPO high—and it’s a frequent target of market commentators, but CEO Michael Intrator says the company’s move to the public markets has been “incredibly successful.” And he takes the public’s mixed reaction in stride, given the novelty of CoreWeave’s “neocloud” business, which competes with established cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud. “When you introduce new models, introduce a new way of doing business, disrupt what has been a static environment, it’s going to take some people some time,” Intrator said Tuesday at the Fortune Brainstorm AI conference in San Francisco. But, he added, more people are beginning to understand the CoreWeave business model. “We came out into one of the most challenging environments,” Intrator said of CoreWeave’s March IPO, which occurred very close to President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs in April. “In spite of the incredible headwinds, [we were] able to launch a successful IPO.” CoreWeave, which priced its IPO at $40 per share, has experienced frequent severe up-and-down price swings in the eight months since its public market debut. At its closing price of $90.66 on Tuesday, the stock remains well above its IPO price. As Fortune reported last month, CoreWeave’s rapid rise has been fueled by an aggressive, debt-heavy strategy to stand up data centers at unprecedented speed for AI customers. And for now, the bet is still paying off. In its third-quarter results released in November, the company said its revenue backlog nearly doubled in a single quarter—to $55.6 billion from $30 billion—reflecting long-term commitments from marquee clients including Meta and OpenAI, as well as French AI startup Poolside. Both earnings and revenue came in ahead of Wall Street expectations. But the numbers were not all celebratory. CoreWeave disclosed a further increase in the debt it has taken on to finance its expansion, and it revised its full-year revenue outlook downward—even with historic demand in the pipeline. With media headlines calling CoreWeave a “ticking time bomb,” and critics calling out insider stock sales, circular financing accusations, and an overreliance on Nvidia, Intrator was asked whether he felt CoreWeave was misunderstood. “Look, we built a company that is challenging one of the most stable businesses that exist—that cloud business, these three massive players,” he said, referring to AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. I feel like it’s incumbent on CoreWeave to introduce a new business model on how the cloud is going to be built and run. And that’s what we’re doing.” He repeatedly framed CoreWeave not as a GPU reseller or traditional data-center operator but as a company purpose-built from scratch to deliver high-performance, parallelized computing for AI workloads. That focus, he said, means designing proprietary software that orchestrates GPUs, building and colocating its own infrastructure, and moving “up the stack” through acquisitions such as Weights & Biases and OpenPipe. Intrator also defended the company’s debt strategy, saying CoreWeave is effectively inventing a new financing model for AI infrastructure. He pointed to the company’s ability to repurpose power sources, rapidly deploy capacity, and finance large-scale clusters as proof it is solving problems incumbents never had to face. “When I look back at the history of the company, it took us a year with a company investor like Fidelity, before they were like, ‘Oh, I get it,’” he said. “So look, we’ve been public for eight months. I couldn’t be prouder of what the company has accomplished.”

Title: Bitget Reports Record 4,468% Surge in Tokenized US Stock Futures During Earnings Season

December 09, 2025 08:02 ET | Source: Bitget Limited Bitget Limited Seychelles Seychelles VICTORIA, Seychelles, Dec. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bitget, the world’s largest Universal Exchange (UEX), has released new data showing unprecedented growth in global demand for tokenized US equities during the recent earnings season. From mid-October to the end of November, spot trading volume for tokenized US stock tokens increased by 452% month-over-month, while futures trading volume rose by 4,468%, marking the strongest period of activity since these products launched on Bitget. The report examines the acceleration of tokenized equity adoption and identifies three underlying forces driving this growth. The first is the composition of assets themselves, with demand gravitating toward technology leaders and crypto-linked equities that offer high volatility and directional opportunity. The second is the shift toward 24-hour market accessibility, which lowers traditional barriers and allows traders to participate across global time zones without interruption. The third is the influence of a globally diverse user base, whose trading patterns and risk appetites are reshaping how tokenized markets form, scale, and mature. Futures markets experienced extraordinarily aggressive trading behavior centered around mega-cap technology stocks, with Tesla, Meta, MicroStrategy, Apple, and the Nasdaq-100 ETF (QQQ) dominating activity. Meta’s futures volume increased 40,774%, Microsoft 24,339%, and MicroStrategy 11,684% MoM, reflecting traders’ efforts to capture earnings-driven volatility and AI-related momentum. Spot market participation showed a more balanced allocation pattern. Nvidia led with 1,888% MoM growth, accompanied by broad index exposure through QQQ (+3,492%) and SPY (+3,247%). The surge in demand for TLT (+69,573% MoM), the long-term Treasury ETF, demonstrated a move toward defensive hedging and macro risk management during a volatile reporting season. Bitget’s 5×24 trading model proved critical in enabling this activity. Global trading patterns revealed that Asian users, in particular, leveraged extended access to respond to earnings releases, adjust positions before the US market opens, and mitigate overnight risk, advantages unavailable through traditional equity markets. The user base remained distinctly international, led by East Asia (39.66%), alongside meaningful participation from Latin America, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Europe. Behavioral segmentation showed high-frequency “whales” executing an average of 51.7 trades per day, while retail traders engaged more selectively around earnings catalysts. “What we’re seeing is the emergence of a fully democratized global equity market,” said Gracy Chen, CEO of Bitget. “When investors across continents can participate in earnings season in real time, using USDT, with 24-hour access and without geographic barriers, the market becomes broader, more liquid, and fundamentally more sophisticated. Tokenized equities are no longer experimental. They are becoming a mainstream asset class shaped by global capital and global behavior.” Bitget’s findings indicate that tokenized stock tokens have entered a new phase of structural maturity, defined by diversified investment strategies, seamless global access, and increasingly sophisticated market participants.

If youâre looking for a more immersive way to play your favorite titles, where the digital world becomes your reality in every sense, you need a VR set in your setup. These not only offer better visuals, but also unique sensations based on whateverâs happening in the game, pulling you into action. PlayStation owners should consider grabbing the PSVR2, especially now that itâs going at a 25% discount at Amazon. This brings its usual $400 price down to $299, which, while not the lowest price ever, is still not bad considering all the features the bundle comes packed with. Itâs open to all shoppers, and you donât have to worry about any delivery charges either. Just be sure to grab it quick. Amazon hasnât specified an end date for this one, but weâre not expecting it to stick around for more than a couple of days. See at Amazon The bundle includes the PlayStation VR2 headset and a pair of Sense controllers. The headset is comfortable to wear, featuring a rear band that sits a bit low on the back of your head for stability. Once on, the two 2000 x 2040 OLED displays push incredibly sharp and vibrant 4K HDR visuals, which are four times better than the original PSVR. Thereâs support for eye tracking that simulates emotional responses from the version of you in the game for a better sense of realism, especially when playing with friends. The headset is also designed to be responsive with vibrations, meaning in-game sensations can be felt like theyâre happening right in your living room. For instance, when cars race past, youâll feel a burst of movement around through the headset. But of course, visuals alone canât offer a truly immersive experience, and for that, thereâs 3D audio that surrounds you and adapts to your position with head movements. Everything from whispers to footsteps, gunfire, and screams will be heard as if youâre right in the middle of the battlefield. Best of all, you can still keep an eye on whatâs happening in the real world with the See-through View function. As for the controllers â these offer haptic feedback for you to physically feel your in-game responses in the form of vibrations, intense pulses, and more. Finger touch detection lets you feel elements of the virtual world even when youâre not pressing any buttons, while adaptive triggers make it easy to sense the digital tension and resistance. The latter is great for feeling that bowstring pull when youâre just about to hit a bad guy, or sensing objects crumple as you crush them in your hand just before delivering an Oscar-worthy line. All in all, if youâve been looking to play your favorite titles in a way that makes you feel like youâre a part of the action, a VR bundle can deliver exactly that and more. This one, in particular, offers immersive, 4K visuals that show every in-game detail in a lifelike manner, plus let you feel all thatâs happening in the digital world with unique sensations through the controllers. The bundle typically retails for $400, but you can now snap it up for $299 after a sweet 25% discount. Amazon wonât be this generous for long, and considering how there are no major sales lined up, itâs best to get your orders in as soon as you can.

Title: The U.S. Is Betting the Economy on ‘Scaling’ AI: Where Is the Intelligence When One Needs It?

Yves here. Servaas Storm provides a fantastic broad and properly sobering view on the AI/stock market mania and the far too many reasons why US players can’t possibly deliver on their hype. One tiny quibble, more of presentation: Storm discusses AI borrowing, initially making it sound as if it is being done by the big players themselves, which to some degree it has been. He then does describe how they are increasingly making use of off balance sheet vehicles, and so far, investors are bizarrely keen about them. I have not looked at any of these structures, but wonder how off-balance-sheet they will prove to be in practice. During the financial crisis, banks who had been securitizing credit card receivables found out lenders were making them eat some of the losses, despite the entities having been structured so as to be arm’s length. The funders said, effectively: Try selling us another one. The banks depended on being able to off-load the receivables (they could not afford the capital costs of retaining them) and so relented. In at least one data-center deal, Meta had signed up for four successive five year leases. When I was as kid, we’d capitalize this sort of commitment as an operating lease and treat it as debt. That does not seem to be modern practice. What happens if the underlying business comes a cropper? Does Meta try to default on the lease payments? By Servaas Storm, Senior Lecturer of Economics, Delft University of Technology. Originally published at the Institute for New Economic Thinking website Introduction Three years ago, on November 30, 2022, ChatGPT was released to the public. This Large Language Model (LLM) was a total novelty, an AI tool that appeared able to do things that no one believed to be possible. Within five days of launch, over one million users had signed up to chat with the AI bot – a growth rate 30 times faster than Instagram’s and 6 times faster than TikTok’s at their start. It became the fastest-growing consumer product in history, recording more than 800 million weekly users in October 2025. OpenAI, the start-up that developed ChatGPT and that began as a non-profit in 2015, became a household-name almost overnight, and is now valued at $500 billion or even $1 trillion (for an initial public offering). Surfing the LLM wave, Nvidia, the producer of around 94% of the GPUs needed by the AI industry, hit, as the first public corporation ever, a market capitalization of $5 trillion on October 29, 2025, up from just $0.4 trillion in 2022. Nvidia currently has a weight of around 8.5% in the S&P500 Index, while the so-called ‘Magnificent 7’ (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) have a combined weight in the S&P500 of circa 37%. The data-centre investments by a concentrated set of hyper-scalers in the American AI industry constitute the main source of growth in an otherwise sclerotic U.S. economy. The U.S. is betting the economy on reaching Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), by building ever bigger computing infrastructure to run and test-time their LLMs, using more GPUs, more power, more cooling water and more data than ever before. But three years after ChatGPT’s launch, fears are growing in many quarters that the bet on scaling LLMs to reach AGI is going wrong. The AI boom, many whisper, may be a bubble. The Trump administration and the AI industry are showing signs of nervousness. At a recent Wall Street Journal tech conference, OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar suggested that a government loan guarantee might be necessary to fund the enormous investments needed to keep the company at the cutting edge. Her coded message was that OpenAI has become TBTF. The message was understood. President Trump’s AI and crypto czar, David Sacks said (in response) that a reversal in AI-related investments would risk a recession. “We can’t afford to go backwards,” he added, indication support for Friar’s demand. (He later clarified that he remains opposed to any bailouts for individual companies in the AI sector.) History Rhymes, Or Is This Time Different? The U.S. stock market is definitely firmly in bubble territory. Figure 1 presents data on the S&P 500’s Shiller P/E Ratio, calculated as average inflation-adjusted earnings from the previous 10 years. Historically, a Shiller P/E Ratio above 30 has been a harbinger of speculative excess, followed by a bear market. In December 2023, the Shiller index rose to 30.45 and has remained above 30 ever since; in November 2025, the Shiller P/E ratio rose above 40. Since 1871, this is only the sixth instance in which the CAPE Ratio exceeded 30. The first time it happened was during August-September 1929 and we all know what came next: the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 89% of its value. The second time it happened occurred almost seven decades later: during the end-of-the-millennium dotcom bubble, when the Shiller P/E ratio recorded an all-time high of 44.19 in December 1999. Following the bursting of the dot-com bubble, the S&P 500 lost 49% of its peak value. The next three peaks above 30 in the Shiller P/E Ratio occurred very recently: during September 2017-November 2018; December 2019-February 2020; and August 2020-May 2022. Following these surges, the S&P 500 eventually dropped by anywhere between 20% and 33%. We are currently living in the sixth such period of speculative excess. Source: Robert Shiller (2025), https://shillerdata.com/ (accessed on 15/11/2025) However, the AI party is still in full swing. AI firms are racing to build out data centre infrastructure for what they believe is virtually limitless demand for AI services. Capital expenditures on data-centre infrastructure by Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft are steeply rising (also as a percentage of sales) (Figure 2). JP Morgan Chase & Co projects that 122GW of data centre capacity will be built from 2026-2030 to satisfy the (arguably) astronomical demand for ‘compute’ (Wigglesworth 2025a). The additional 122GW of data centre capacity is estimated to cost between $5-7 trillion. For 2026, the projected data centre funding needs will be around $700 billion, which, according to the report, could probably be entirely financed by hyper-scaler cash flows and by High-Grade bond markets. “However, 2030 funding needs are in excess of $1.4 trillion, which will surpass current market capabilities, necessitating the search for alternative funding sources.” Source: Christopher Mims (2025), ‘When AI Hype Meets AI Reality: A Reckoning in 6 Charts.’ Wall Street Journal, November 14. Crucially, most of the mega-financing deals are remarkably circular. To give you a flavour: Nvidia invests in OpenAI and OpenAI is looking to buy millions of Nvidia’s specialized chips. OpenAI buys computing power from Oracle which buys Nvidia’s GPUs. Nvidia owns about 5% of CoreWeave and sells chips to CoreWeave. CoreWeave’s biggest customer is Microsoft, which is an investor in OpenAI, shares revenue with OpenAI, buys chips from Nvidia and has partnerships with AMD. AMD, a rival to Nvidia, was so eager to land OpenAI as a customer that it issued warrants for OpenAI to buy 10% of AMD at a penny a share. OpenAI is a CoreWeave customer and also a shareholder. Nvidia has invested in xAI and will supply it with processors. And so on and so forth. The deals include revenue sharing across the stack and cross-ownership. Nothing in these circular deals is transparent. It is not clear where the money needed for these deals is coming from. It is not clear what these opaque circular transactions imply for the valuations of the listed and non-public AI firms involved. It is not clear what all this means for the competition over hardware between chip producers (Nvidia versus AMD) and over AI services AI startups (OpenAI versus Anthropic versus xAI versus Microsoft). Not surprisingly, therefore, these astronomical circular financing deals (referencing billions of U.S. dollars) are raising eyebrows. To many observers, they bring back traumatic memories of the circular financing arrangements of the late 1990s, when vendors and clients reinforced each other’s dotcom stock valuations without generating any real value. AI Bang or Bubble? AI industry leaders are now busy doubling down on their message that the AI revolution is NOT A BUBBLE, but real and sustainable. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated (in an earnings call on November 19) that there is no AI bubble and exponentially growing AI demand is structural rather than speculative. Huang claims that the AI boom constitutes a Big Bang, a historical revolution, because of three fundamental shifts toward accelerated computing: the move from CPUs to GPUs (which can simultaneously process multiple tasks and solutions), the rise of generative AI, and the emergence of agentic AI systems that supposedly can independently make decisions based on large datasets. Asset-managing firm Blackrock concurs: “AI is not just a technological trend; it represents an infrastructure transformation with growing macroeconomic significance”, adding that “unlike the speculative frenzy of the late 1990s and early 2000s, today’s technology leaders are anchored by fundamental stability.” The optimistic vibes around the transformative power of AI have even infected Nouriel Roubini (2025), the profession’s perennial Dr. Doom and now a senior economic strategist at Hudson Bay Capital, who has somehow become convinced that the tailwinds of the unprecedented AI data-centre investment boom will overwhelm any disruptions coming from Trump’s tariffs and geopolitical strains. But the various statements by Huang, Blackrock and Roubini are “sound and fury, signifying nothing.” The structural demand for Nvidia’s GPUs originates from the same circle of companies that are betting the business on scaling AI. The AI data centres may not be the “shovels of the AI gold rush”, but rather a black hole in which billions of dollars disappear. The surge in demand for GPUs and data-centre infrastructure may, in other words, very well be speculative, if it turns out that the AI models are not delivering good value for money to the investors – and cannot live up to the exaggerated expectations of the Lords of the AI Ring. Every reader of Kindleberger and Galbraith knows that this would not be the first time in (economic) history that most people – all in the same bubble – had it fully wrong, all at the same time. The financial crisis of 2008 is just the most recent example of a collective mania that ended in a crash. The Insufferable Irrationality of the AI Industry The AI race is mostly based on the irrational fear of missing out (FOMO), in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street – which induces a herd mentality to follow ‘momentum’, a complete disregard for fundamental values in favour of placing an exaggerated importance to the limited availability of a key resource (here: Nvidia’s GPUs and ‘compute’), and overwhelming confirmation bias (the all-too-human inclination to look for information that confirms our own biased outlook). To bring home the point: the use of ChatGPT has been found to decrease idea diversity in brainstorming, as per an article in Nature. It is deeply ironic that the industry that is supposed to build ‘super-intelligence’, a deeply flawed concept with rather sinister origins (see Emily M. Bender and Alex Hanna 2025), is itself deeply irrational. But solid anthropological evidence on the local tribes living in Silicon Valley and working on Wall Street shows that this irrationality is hardwired into the perma-adolescent psyches of the inhabitants, who are wont to talk to each other about the coming AIpocalypse, almost religiously believe in AI prophecies, have deep faith in their algorithms, regard AI as a superior ‘sentient being’ in need of legal representation, enthusiastically engage in techno-eschatology, and, above all, are deeply fond of Hobbits and the LOTR. These very same people are also used to talk about and think in terms of billions of dollars as just ‘stuff’ that funds compute, necessary for scaling in order to reach AGI. “I don’t care if we burn $50 billion a year, we’re building AGI,” Sam Altman said, adding: “We are making AGI, and it is going to be expensive and totally worth it.” The same Sam Altman lost his cool during an interview with podcaster and OpenAI investor Brad Gerstner, when he was asked how it all is supposed to add up, given OpenAI’s miniscule revenue. “If you want to sell your shares, I’ll find you a buyer,” a taken-aback Altman replied curtly. “Enough.” There are more signs of irrationality in the AI industry. In the first six months of 2025, AI start-ups that have no profits, no sales, no pitch and no product to speak of, have been securing billions of dollars of funding. For example, pre-revenue, pre-product AI company ‘Safe Superintelligence’, founded by Ilya Sutskever, ex-chief scientist at OpenAI, raised $2 billion at a $32 billion valuation in April 2025. Similarly, ‘Thinking Machines Lab’, an AI research and product company launched by OpenAI’s former chief technology officer Mira Murati, raised $2 billion at a valuation of $12 billion from investors such as Nvidia, AMD and Cisco in July 2025. The company has not released a product, has no customers and has even refused to tell investors what they’re even trying to build. “It was the most absurd pitch meeting,” one investor who met with Murati said. “She was like, ‘So we’re doing an AI company with the best AI people, but we can’t answer any questions.” The best AI people are in charge, or so they tell us. A handful of labs, led by Tolkienesque techies, control the narrative around frontier LLMs. The narrative they tell the public is that they are on a mission to build AGI to benefit all of humanity, but this emerging autonomous super-intelligence is so complex and potentially dangerous, even apocalyptic. Anthropic’s chief scientist Jared Kaplan is only the latest in a long line of AI-experts sounding the alarm; or consider Geoffrey Hinton who predicts, once more, the total breakdown of society once AI gets smarter than people. The overblown claims go like this: “It would become impossible for humans to get paid to do work because the superintelligence could do it better and cheaper. You and I would not have jobs. Nobody would have jobs.” The message is clear: reaching AGI is Very Serious Stuff, and Potentially Dangerous. But rest assured: the AI-developers can safely handle these risks and they have the expertise to decide what counts as ‘safe’. Reaching AGI will also need gigantic data-centres, land, electricity and water (for cooling), but don’t worry: the promised results will be transformative and a benefit for all. AGI will find cures for cancer, discover ways to end hunger, solve the affordability crisis, empower students and workers, and somehow also solve climate change. Just trust us, they tell us. Give us the resources we need to build AGI. But what they tell their investors is altogether different: we are building technology that can “do essentially what you will pay us for”, including making workers redundant by automating jobs or turning them into gig workers while putting them under corporate surveillance. Emily M. Bender and Alex Hanna (2025) recount, for example, how the National Eating Disorders Association in the U.S. replaced their hotline operators with a chatbot days after the former voted to unionise. AI algorithms also work successfully to help landlords push the highest possible rents on tenants. Likewise, the health insurance industry uses AI automation and predictive technologies to systematically deny patients coverage for necessary medical care. AI also works for the military: defence company Anduril builds autonomous drones, virtual reality headsets, and other AI-powered technologies for the U.S. military. And private equity firms are hiring AI people to go through the companies they own and see how these should be restructured. This way, the AI industry has convinced the financial sector, the cash-rich platform corporations and wealthy venture capitalists to invest their cash in funding the training and inference of the LLMs and the giga-data-centre infrastructure, that is driving the current AGI boom in the U.S. In a new Working Paper, I argue that this AI data-centre investment boom is a bubble which will pop, probably rather sooner than later. This will prove to be socially costly to the larger U.S. economy, not just because of the inevitable correction, crash and recession, but more fundamentally, in terms of the scarce resources that have been and will be wasted on the hallucinogenic pipe dreams of a few entitled Ayn Randian billionaire tech brothers and sisters, who, quite in character and as was noted already above, have begun to hedge their bets by begging the taxpayer for subsidies and government loan guarantees (Cooper 2025). The AI bubble will eventually pop for the following four reasons. The Revenue Delusion There is no world in which the enormous spending in data centre infrastructure (more than $5 trillion in the next five years) is going to pay off; the AI-revenue projections are pie-in-the-sky because of the following: Hence, most AI companies will fail to turn a profit, as prices will fall (because of Chinese competition), while (training and inference) costs go up due to the scaling strategy. Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS) 2023-2025. Notes: The U.S. Census Bureau conducts a biweekly survey of 1.2 million firms. Businesses are asked whether they have used AI tools such as machine learning, natural language processing, virtual agents or voice recognition to help produce goods or services in the past two weeks. See Torsten Sløk (2025b), https://www.apolloacademy.com/ai-adoption-rate-trending-down-for-large-companies/ The Ticking Time-Bomb of Hyperscale Borrowing There is no way in which the AI industry can fund its capital expenditures out of revenues from paid subscribers or money from sovereign wealth funds. Hence, AI firms will have to resort to hyperscale borrowing from banks and investment-grade bond markets to fund their capex, laying the foundations for the next debt crisis. This hyperscale borrowing will create a ticking time bomb on the balance sheets of AI firms, because the core capital expenditure is on specialised GPUs and servers, which — because of unrelenting technological progress — risk becoming economically obsolete within two or three years. Nvidia is not helping in this respect, because it is building new generation GPUs each and every year and GPU prices are likely falling. Nvidia’s latest generation Blackwell GPU’s require entirely new servers, and if you use many of them, an entirely new data centre, because the Blackwell GPUs require much more power and cooling. The rate of economic decay of the AI compute infrastructure, therefore, is high and the payback periods are correspondingly short. “You’re investing in something that is a perishable good,” economist David McWilliams told Fortune, calling AI hardware “digital lettuce” that is “going to go off now.” Data servers, networking equipment and storage devices have a useful lifetime of 3-5 years and a corresponding annual depreciation rate of 20%-30%. These chips are not general-purpose compute engines; they are purpose-built for training and running generative AI models, tuned to the specific architectures and software stacks of a few major suppliers such as Nvidia, Google, and Amazon. These chips are part of purpose-built AI data centres — engineered for extreme power density, advanced cooling, and specialised networking. Together, they form a closed system optimised for scale but hard to repurpose. Figure 4 shows borrowing for AI data-centre construction. Investment-grade (IG) borrowing by AI big tech firms during September-October 2025 amounted to $75 billion — compared to $32 billion on average per year during 2015-2024. IG bonds issued by the AI companies make up 14% of the American IG bond market in October 2025. Barclays estimates that cumulative AI-related investment could reach the equivalent of more than 10% of U.S. GDP by 2029, compared to circa 6% in the first six months of 2025. OpenAI, Anthropic and other startups continue to lose money, and must fund most of the planned investment by selling off pieces of themselves to investors and by resorting to hyperscale borrowing from banks and investment-grade bond markets. Ignoring numerous red flags, particularly operating and financial leverage and the short pay-back periods, virtually every Wall Street player is angling to get a slice of the action, generally via off-balance-sheet Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs), from banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley to asset managers such as BlackRock and Apollo Global Management. This Wall Street frenzy will in all likelihood lay the foundations for the next debt crisis (Fitch 2025). Source: Bank of America Global Research; chart created by Lucy Raitano (October 31 2025). Notes: IG = investment grade. The data for Blue Owl and Meta refer to a project-style holding company created by Blue Owl Capital to invest in a large-scale Hyperion data centre joint venture with Meta. Exponential Growth in an Analogue World It will be impossible to build the projected data centre infrastructure in the next five years or so (which is the horizon of most AI investors). The lead time necessary to build a hyperscale data centre is currently around 2 years, but expect it to become much longer, say 7 or more years. Why? Upstream suppliers to the growth in data centres — the established industrial companies — have to expand production. These upstream suppliers will run into labour shortages, long waiting times for power grid connections, material bottlenecks and regulatory blowback – and all this will lengthen the lead times necessary to build a hyperscale data centre, as explained in more detail in the Working Paper. FT Alphaville (2025) further notes that the nature of the AI-related power demand is particularly problematic (Wigglesworth 2025a). It cites a recent Nvidia (2025) report: “Unlike a traditional data center running thousands of uncorrelated tasks, an AI factory operates as a single, synchronous system. When training a large language model (LLM), thousands of GPUs execute cycles of intense computation, followed by periods of data exchange, in near-perfect unison. This creates a facility-wide power profile characterized by massive and rapid load swings. This volatility challenge has been documented in joint research by NVIDIA, Microsoft, and OpenAI on power stabilization for AI training data centers. The research shows how synchronized GPU workloads can cause grid-scale oscillations. The power draw of a rack can swing from an “idle” state of around 30% to 100% utilization and back again in milliseconds. This forces engineers to oversize components for handling the peak current, not the average, driving up costs and footprint. When aggregated across an entire data hall, these volatile swings — representing hundreds of megawatts ramping up and down in seconds — pose a significant threat to the stability of the utility grid, making grid interconnection a primary bottleneck for AI scaling.” AI Scaling is Hitting a Wall The strategic bet of leading AI firms that Generative AI can be achieved by building ever more data centres and using ever more chips is already going bad. This scaling strategy is already exhibiting diminishing returns. It is the wrong strategy, since generic LLMs are not constructed on proper and robust world models, but instead are built to autocomplete, based on sophisticated pattern-matching (Shojaee et al. 2025). LLMs will continue to make errors and hallucinate, especially when used outside their training data. Generic AI products are never going to actually work right and will continue to be untrustworthy. Three years into the LLM wave, AI-expert Gary Marcus explains very clearly why ChatGPT has not lived up to expectations: “The results are disappointing because the underlying tech is unreliable. And that’s been obvious from the start.” Generic LLMs are hard to control; they still can’t reason reliably and never will; they still don’t work reliably with external tools; they continue to hallucinate; they still can’t match domain specific models, they continue to struggle with alignment between what human beings want and what machines actually do. “The truth is that ChatGPT has never grown up,” Marcus concludes. Marcus also presents disturbing new research on the performance of frontier LLMs across three benchmarks by CMU professor Niloofar Mireshgalleh. The first benchmark is a math test that could plausibly be answered by large quantities of data. Unsurprisingly, the frontier LLMs perform increasingly well – but, as we saw, at the cost of gigantic volumes of compute. On the second benchmark (which is focused on coding), initial progress in performance is now tailing off, exhibiting diminishing returns. However, as Marcus explains, on the third benchmark, “on a complex task combining theory of mind and privacy that seems harder to game”, the frontier LLMs show slow linear progress – again, at the cost of billions of dollars and huge quantities of electricity and water. In sum, progress in performance on complex tasks is just terribly slow – which is the key factor explaining the disappointment of users of LLMs and the limits to profitable adoption by enterprises. LLMs are great at generating plausible output – while being much less good at getting their facts straight, while being incapable of reasoning. The hardwired inclination to hallucinate (Metz and Weise 2025) limits the usefulness of AI in high-stakes activities such as healthcare, education and finance. Potential liabilities resulting from the harm done by the decisions of autonomous unsupervised AI tools are simply too large in these high-stake activities — and this will restrict the adoption of and reliance on such AI tools. More generally, we have to think of LLMs, as Bender and Hanna (2025), suggest, as “synthetic text-extruding machines”. “Like an industrial plastic process,” they explain, text databases “are forced through complicated machinery to produce a product that looks like communicative language, but without any intent or thinking mind behind it”. The same is true of other “generative” AI models that spit out images and music. They are all, the authors say, “synthetic media machines” – or giant plagiarism machines. “Both language models and text-to-image models will out-and-out plagiarize their inputs,” the authors write. A large fraction of the output will be AI-slop. In an ironic twist, the supply of AI-slop will only increase in future, because due to the lack of ‘authentic training data’, LLMs will increase their input of ‘synthetic’ AI-generated artificial data — an incredible act of self-poisoning. The more AI-slop these models ingest, the greater the likelihood that their outputs will be junk: the “garbage-in, garbage-out” (GIGO) principle does hold. AI systems, which are trained on their own outputs, gradually lose accuracy, diversity, and reliability. This occurs because errors compound across successive model generations, leading to distorted data distributions and irreversible defects in performance. Veteran tech columnist Steven Vaughn-Nichols warns that “we’re going to invest more and more in AI, right up to the point that model collapse hits hard and AI answers are so bad even a brain-dead CEO can’t ignore it.” Conclusion Because of these four reasons, AI’s ‘scaling’ strategy will fail and the AI data-centre investment bubble will pop. The unavoidable AI-data-centre crash in the U.S. will be painful to the economy, even if some useful technology and infrastructure will survive and be productive in the longer run. However, given the unrestricted greed of the platform and other Big Tech corporations, this will also mean that AI tools that weaken the labour conditions — in activities including the visual arts, education, health care and the media — will survive. Similarly, generative AI is already entrenched in militaries and intelligence agencies and will, for sure, get used for surveillance and corporate control. All the big promises of the AI industry will fade, but many harmful uses of the technology will stick around. The immediate economic harm done will look rather insignificant compared to the long-term damage of the AI mania. The continuous oversupply of AI slop, LLM fabricated hallucinations, clickbait fake news and propaganda, deliberate deepfake images and endless machine-made junk, all produced under capitalism’s banner of progress and greed, consuming loads of energy and spouting tonnes of carbon emissions will further undermine and self-poison the trust in and the foundations of America’s economic and social order. The massive direct and indirect costs of generic LLMs will outweigh the rather limited benefits, by far. FWIW. This morning from DeepSeek. … Thank you for that important clarification. You are absolutely right to correct the author. “The AI Con” is by Alex Hanna and Emily M. Bender (released in 2025). The previous answer incorrectly attributed it to Josh Bivens, whose book is “The Ultimate Goal.” My apologies for the confusion… Hallucination is a technical term for any result we don’t like. For the AI, it is all hallucination. Hallucination is an extreme case of misperception. First one has to admit that our senses are far from perfect so we human can naturally hallucinate. For instance when we see mirages in the desert. Couple our limitations with drugs and the hallucinations can become a permanent feature. Illusory thinking and illusory perceptions might be defined as a kind of hallucination which derives from strong stimuli. Because the LLMs are forced to have an answer (are stimulated to reply) always or nearly always the term “illusory thinking” might be more appropriate than hallucination. For the AI it is all an illusion. Just an illusion for the elder or a beautiful Illusion for the younger. You can Hallucinate (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgBmIfaHLKQ&list=RDGgBmIfaHLKQ&start_radio=1) with this Dua Lipa. I think hallucination is a sort of marketing term that implies that the results that we consider bad are anomalous, like a made up reference is worse than a real one for us. For the LLM they are the same. Humans are prone to apophenia, or seeing patterns in random information that aren’t there, it seems generative AI applies the patterns whether they are there or not. People are also prone to generate plausible answers with no information, and present them as if they were true. This behavior, epitomized in the BS artist, has also been adopted by chatbots. “Three years ago, on November 30, 2022, ChatGPT was released to the public.” What tells another part of the story: Look at what the the Nasdaq and S&P indexes were doing in 2022. Some hype needed to be created and fast. Outstanding article. Does a good job of summarizing the major problems of the AI craze in an accessible way (Ed Zitron gets a shout-out, which I find personally satisfying since it shows that a bizzare writing style does not lock you out of the discourse!) One thing I don’t understand is why the fourth section of critiques, which is basically that AI doesn’t work and is unfit for purpose, is left for last. This seems to be a common feature of AI criticism, the fact that AI is technically unsound and inherently dangerous, is downplayed and treated as a minor issue compared to things like economic problems in the industry. The strategic bet of leading AI firms that Generative AI can be achieved by building ever more data centres and using ever more chips is already going bad. This scaling strategy is already exhibiting diminishing returns. It is the wrong strategy, since generic LLMs are not constructed on proper and robust world models, but instead are built to autocomplete, based on sophisticated pattern-matching (Shojaee et al. 2025). LLMs will continue to make errors and hallucinate, especially when used outside their training data. Generic AI products are never going to actually work right and will continue to be untrustworthy. Talk about burying the lede! BTW, there is an extremely good metaphor for LLMs in here: More generally, we have to think of LLMs … as “synthetic text-extruding machines”. “Like an industrial plastic process,” they explain, text databases “are forced through complicated machinery to produce a product that looks like communicative language, but without any intent or thinking mind behind it”. It’s an urgent task to find ways to explain the problems with AI in ways that people outside the industry can effectively grasp. “AI industry leaders are now busy doubling down on their message that the AI revolution is NOT A BUBBLE…” When “industry leaders” feel the need to make such a statement it’s a sure sign that it is. Not sure which deals, but in the case of Meta raising funding for AI data centres, Zuckerberg has personally promised to reimburse the investors in the event that things go sideways. If he had not done so, no one was going to invest so much as a nickel. A promise you can take to the bank, I’m sure. Ha Ha. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Pick Your Financial Crash
URL: http://prospect.org/2025/12/09/pick-your-financial-crash/
Time Published: 2025-12-09T10:15:00Z
Full Content:
The stock market has made gains at rates that are several multiples more than the growth of the real economy for three years running. Investor euphoria is always a sign of danger ahead, but this time there are other special factors signaling a pending crash. And of course, they all interact. Once investors head for the exits, others start bailing. I. Deregulation of Increasing Risk. Trump’s bank regulators are systematically dismantling the safeguards that were put in place after the financial collapse of 2008. That crash was caused by opaque financial instruments such as credit derivatives that allowed almost infinite amounts of leverage. When they turned out to be worthless, the collapse was also nearly infinite. In the aftermath, Congress and the regulators limited the risks that banks could take. In classic Wall Street form, the wise guys responded by creating non-banks that could do most of what banks do. One “innovation” was private credit, a cool-kid word for shadow banking. Another was fintech, a cool-kid word for shadow banking with an app. These newly invented lenders are banks in everything but name, and thus evade nearly all transparency, supervision, or regulation. Absent regulation, these non-bank banks can engage in sky-high leverage, meaning that the ratio of lending to their own real capital can be unlimited and unexamined. More from Robert Kuttner In 2013, as part of the post-2008 reforms, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Reserve put in place leverage limits for banks. Loans worth more than six times a company’s annual earnings were seen as too risky. That ruled out a lot of bank loans to fund private equity takeover targets, or loans to tech fantasies that had no earnings. Private credit stepped in to fund those projects that banks couldn’t take. Capital raised for lending to private equity–backed companies jumped more than a hundredfold to nearly $700 billion between 2006 and 2024, according to The Wall Street Journal. One thing that isn’t well understood is that private credit is propped up by traditional banks; Moody’s reported in October that banks have lent $300 billion to private credit firms. So if those firms go kablooey, it won’t stop short of the broader financial system, but cascade through the heart of Wall Street. Nevertheless, the banks complained to the regulators that they were losing business (to the very companies they were funding). Given what we know about the crashes of 2008 and 1929, the right policy would be to bring the upstarts under the regulatory umbrella. But instead, last Friday the agencies agreed to the bankers’ demands to help competition by deregulating the banks and getting rid of the 2013 leverage limits. Now, dealmakers can play banks off against private credit entities for the best (most risky) terms. And banks can go beyond funding non-banks and set up their own non-bank affiliates. When the inevitable crash comes, government will bail out the insiders, leaving regular people to suffer the aftermath. II. Crypto. The value of Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies have been on a wild ride. Crypto plays no useful function in the economy except for pursuing illegal transactions and speculation in crypto itself. When crypto was the next new thing, and investors keep bidding up the market value of crypto coins, everyone looked like a financial genius. The whole market has been banking on self-enrichment by the Trump family and his key allies—like Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who handed his crypto-friendly bank Cantor Fitzgerald to his son and has seen it enjoy its best year ever—leading to regulatory leniency and therefore freedom to make a fortune. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. Congress, on the take from the crypto industry, added to the hype last July by enacting the GENIUS Act, which stands for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins.” The act, written by the industry, pretends to provide prudent regulation, giving crypto a kind of federal blessing, but with no real protection for investors. But as the old Wall Street saying goes, genius is a rising market. And here again, leverage that works brilliantly on the upside becomes catastrophic when prices start falling. In recent weeks, Bitcoin, the marquee crypto product, has fallen from a peak value of just below $126,000 on October 7 to about $90,000 today. In just one week in November, the asset class lost $400 billion in value. This collapse has multiple knock-on effects on residual crypto plays. As Bloomberg recently reported, “An array of public companies thought they had found a sort of perpetual motion machine: Use your corporate cash to buy up Bitcoin or other digital tokens and presto, your share price shot up even more than the value of the tokens you bought.” But once prices started falling, “The median stock price of US and Canadian-listed digital asset treasuries has fallen 43% this year, with some companies’ stocks falling over 99%.” When the crypto craze began, traditional financial companies were insulated from it. But Wall Street has tried to get in on the action by sponsoring crypto-backed funds, exposing blue-chip firms like BlackRock to risk. I recently got a pitch from a crypto company promoting the story of how an entrepreneur in Argentina shielded himself from exchange rate risk and inflation risk by loading up on Bitcoin. In fact, the entrepreneur could have gotten exactly the same benefits by buying dollars. Buying Bitcoins rather than dollars added the risk that the Bitcoins would lose value—which they have. What’s really happening, as it does in every Ponzi scheme, is that the wise guys, who profited handsomely by getting in early, need more rubes to keep buying the stuff in the hope that it will hold its value. As crypto becomes more interconnected with the rest of an unregulated financial system, the risk is that they will take each other down. III. Artificial Intelligence and Tech. Is the AI boom a bubble? Apologists for the massively inflated value of Nvidia and other digital stocks reliant on the growth of AI keep pointing out that unlike pure stock market bubbles, where inflated stock prices are based mainly on the hope of further price rises, AI is adding real value and Nvidia is earning real and massive profits. Maybe. On the other hand, a dangerously concentrated share of the stock market’s run-up, more than half, is in just seven companies, the so-called Magnificent Seven: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. Of these, Tesla is already faltering. Another tech giant, OpenAI, had a disappointing rollout of the latest version of its marquee product, ChatGPT. The massive bet on AI may pay off in many respects. But any economy that is this highly concentrated is at risk. With inflation rising and the cost of capital increasing with it, the $3 trillion widely projected to be invested in AI in the coming years becomes more costly and risky. Meanwhile, China, which just rang up its first trillion-dollar annual trade surplus as of the end of November, is challenging the U.S. lead in AI. Plus, as the Prospect has reported in detail, the way the build-out of AI is being funded bears numerous resemblances to the housing bubble, with dicey loans, loads of hype, and circular financing. A loss of demand or simply someone calling in their loans could lead to a crash. I am not licensed to provide investment advice. It could be that the highly leveraged loans by private credit will pay off; that the value of crypto will rebound; and that AI will live up to its hype.

In the spirit of the magic of the season (and in hopes of providing some warm respite from the usual end-of-the-year best-of deluge of stories and their attendant doldrums), IndieWire is proud to present our first-ever Holiday Week. [Editor’s note: This list was originally published in December 2022. It has since been updated with new entries.] Rockin’ around the Christmas tree at the Christmas movie stop! That’s right: You’ve reached the North Pole of movie recommendations, where our toymakers (read: film critics) have been hard at work sifting through titles all year long. It’s easy to think of holiday movies as the one area of cinema audiences have permission to practically forget about the rest of the year. With a limited window between Thanksgiving and Christmas, most film lovers can only make time for a handful of seasonally appropriate screenings before New Year’s snaps our attention back to awards season and the big Best Picture contenders. Plus, with new yuletide offerings hitting theaters and streaming platforms in a steady flurry throughout December, there’s only so much time to enjoy Christmas classics while staying current on new holiday fare. Selection is made even more complex when you get into the Christmas genre’s inexplicable tendency toward gatekeeping. It’s a frustrating reality of the movie machine that some titles, for no real discernible reason, get saddled with debates that have relatively little to do with their stories. Such is the case with John McTiernan’s “Die Hard”: the 1988 action-packed crowdpleaser starring Bruce Willis that’s become synonymous with the contentious classification of so-called “Christmas movies” and the separately defined “movies set at Christmas.” In curating this list, we’ve disregarded that delineation, allowing Stanley Kubrick’s psychosexual thriller “Eyes Wide Shut” and Bob Clark’s slasher “Black Christmas” their rightful spots alongside traditional TV specials, from “A Charlie Brown Christmas” to “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.” The best Christmas movies, as defined here, make up a collection of films celebrating and/or challenging the holiday while using its motifs and themes to explore the light and dark sides of the human spirit. Selections have been ranked with both Christmas relevance and overall film quality in mind. Check out IndieWire’s guide to the best Thanksgiving movies. With editorial contributions by David Ehrlich, Jim Hemphill, Sarah Shachat, and Christian Zilko. You’d be hard-pressed to find a Disney fan willing to argue “Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas” is “better” than the original. But director Andy Knight’s straight-to-VHS release from 1997 — a “midquel” imagining Belle and the Beast’s first Christmas, from before Gaston leads that angry mob to their castle in the first film — is ridiculously magical. The story sees none other than Tim Curry give voice to the formidable Forte. A grumpy composer turned into an evil pipe organ by the witch’s curse, the hidden gem Disney villain doesn’t want the spell broken because he likes his new life. The late Paul Reubens voices Forte’s right-hand, Fife, a trembling piccolo willing to do anything for the solo his conductor has promised him if the Beast doesn’t become human. “Enchanted Christmas” makes heavy use of early CGI (Forte himself is entirely digital) and it lacks much of the hand-drawn charm that made the earlier masterpiece. But with Bernadette Peters adding even more holiday cheer — she’s a tree angel and love interest for Lumiere (Jerry Orbach, again) — this is the seed that planted the forest of holiday spin-offs Disney devotees continue to enjoy each year. —AF Netflix has attempted more than its fair share of Christmas movies, including Best Animated Feature nominee “Klaus” in 2019. But “Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey” stands out from the streaming service’s crowd — offering everything from a Dolly Parton musical to Kurt Russell as Santa — with writer/director David Talbert’s delightfully overstuffed celebration of holiday excess. A blistering race through Christmas spectacle, musical bangers, top-notch acting, and maybe (read: definitely) one too many steampunk-inspired visual effects, “Jingle Jangle” makes for a snow globe-like display akin to a modern spin on the chorus line musical extravaganzas of yesteryear. Originally envisioned as a stage production, the 2020 straight-to-streaming film follows Forest Whittaker’s inventor character as he bonds with his brilliant granddaughter, portrayed by Madalen Mills. Together, they pull off a harrowing rescue mission, unravel a dastardly plot, and find new hope in the holiday spirit. —AF For the only tie on this list, we offer up two adaptations of Dr. Seuss’ “How the Grinch Stole Christmas” (knowing full well there are at least two other features you could consider that don’t make the cut). The 1957 children’s story was adapted first by “Looney Tunes” artist Chuck Jones and his longtime collaborator Ben Washam in a brilliantly crafted animated special, which aired on CBS in December 1966. This version boasts Boris Karloff as the voice of the Grinch: a performance that would shape the humbug-turned-unlikely hero for decades to come. Channelling Karloff’s rendering and the curling physicality of Jones and Washam’s illustrative design, Jim Carrey totally embodies the fabled mean one in Ron Howard’s live-action outing from 2000. The aughts favorite is perhaps most celebrated for its quotable lines (“Am I just eating because I’m bored?”) but is infamous for its intense prosthetics and costuming, which Carrey reportedly despised. Still, it earned three Oscar nominations and won for Best Makeup. —AF On par with “The Music Box” and “Way Out West” as a matter of family fun, this Laurel and Hardy musical from 1934 adapts parts of Victor Herbert’s 1903 stage production for a fantastic fairytale adventure revolving around a home mortgage dispute (yes, really). The film’s slap-happy concoction of over-the-top physicality, show-stopping musical numbers, and recognizable storybook characters – including the big man himself, Santa — makes this comedy of errors in Toyland, also known as “March of the Wooden Soldiers,” the best version to date. There have been multiple “Babes in Toyland” movies made for TV, as well as Disney’s 1961 theatrical feature and 1997’s animated take from MGM. —AF Considering the prevalence of his origin story, it’s a wonder Rudolph hasn’t enjoyed a more successful run in film. Sure, Santa’s ninth reindeer appears in some form or another for most of the big man’s movies; even “The Nightmare Before Christmas” gives Jack’s ghost dog Zero an excuse to cosplay as his yuletide counterpart. But as far as standalone Rudolph outings go, nothing has surpassed the 1964 stop-motion TV special (first aired on NBC) and the instantly recognizable franchise it would inspire. “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer” joyfully expands on its namesake poem (and song!) with a story introducing new characters, from love interest Clarice to the Abominable Snow Monster. That tradition would continue in prequel and sequel films, most notably with the iconic Heat Miser in 1974’s “The Year Without Santa Claus.” Still, this is one instance where, if you only have time to enjoy a single film, the original can’t be beat for its hand-crafted care and inherent nostalgia. —AF No, don’t scoff! Yes, “Last Christmas” is a shaggy, odd thing of a film, and yes, the end twist is infamously ridiculous (and also pretty easy to see coming). But Paul Feig’s underrated London Christmas fantasy is also a moving portrayal of self-improvement and growth, with a genuinely wonderful turn from Emilia Clarke as an aimless and surly menial shop worker at its center. Struggling after a health emergency and carrying strained relationships with pretty much everyone in her life, Clarke’s Kate gets a new lease on life when she meets and bonds with Henry Golding’s charming Tom. But “Last Christmas” actually works best when it isn’t a romance: there’s some real edge to Clarke’s portrayal of Kate and her self-destructive attitude that gives the film some unexpected grit, and the screenplay manages to make her eventual redemption feel genuinely earned. Plus, they deliver what you want from a movie with this title, with a stirring closing performance of Wham’s “Last Christmas” that’s simply magical. —WC A simple but nourishing ode to the power of good deeds, “We’re No Angels” sees famous hardboiled cynic Humphrey Bogart take a stab at spreading cheer and whimsy. Michael Curtiz’s film sees the “Casablanca” leading man play Joseph, a prisoner who jail breaks himself from Devil’s Island along with two buddies (Peter Ustinov and Aldo Ray), taking refuge in a local shop. Although they plan to rob the place blind and leave, a Christmas dinner with the kindhearted, struggling family makes them reconsider, as they dedicate themselves to helping their hosts instead. A little weird and wild in its plotting (a venomous snake comes into play), “We’re No Angels” nonetheless is a sweet and simple tale of Christmas redemption, that also has a wee dash of effortless Bogart suave. —WC This horror film about a kid traumatized on Christmas who grows up to go on a killing spree while dressed as Santa sparked national outrage when it was released in 1984, angering parents and critics with both its content and its lurid marketing materials. (Those of us who grew up in the era will never forget the poster with Santa coming out of the chimney with an ax.) As is so often the case, the movie itself got lost in the controversy — which is a shame, because it’s a stone cold slasher masterpiece. Filled with genuine wit and gleeful irony courtesy of screenwriter Michael Hickey, it’s very funny and earns its shocks; director Charles Sellier was a TV producer with hundreds of hours of on-set experience, and his proficient craftsmanship makes this a grim, hilarious Christmas classic. —JH One year before “Die Hard,” writer Shane Black and director Richard Donner brought us the first truly great Christmas action movie of the 80s and made the definitive buddy cop flick in the process. From the opening strains of “Jingle Bell Rock” on the soundtrack and the expertly choreographed shoot-out in a Christmas tree lot to the overall sense of bittersweet holiday melancholy that permeates the proceedings, this is pure Christmas cinema nirvana. Shane Black would return to the holidays many times in many great films (“The Long Kiss Goodnight,” “Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,” “Play Dirty”), but this is the gold standard. —JH It’s been overshadowed in recent years by Greta Gerwig’s genuinely revelatory adaptation, but the 1994 “Little Women” film by Gillian Armstrong has its charms and its pleasures, from a brilliant performance as Jo by a spirited Winona Ryder, an early killer role from Kirsten Dunst as a young Amy, and Christian Bale giving a defining heartthrob turn as a particularly charming Laurie. And like all adaptations of Louisa May Alcott’s beloved novel, the 1994 “Little Women” is a perfect movie to watch during the holidays, between the comforting golden hue with which it renders its rural Massachusetts setting and the bright, decadent costumes on display. The Christmas scenes are more tearjerking than they are joyous, though. —WC Shane Black returns to the subgenre he invented in “Lethal Weapon” with another terrific Christmas action script, this one about an amnesiac teacher (Geena Davis) who learns she was a ruthless assassin in a past life. Director Renny Harlin tears into Black’s script like a Doberman into a prime rib, milking every last set piece for maximum impact — the shoot-outs, car chases, and knife fights are spectacularly entertaining and get a lot of added flavor out of the Christmastime setting. Holiday purists might be put off by the Christmas cheer existing alongside violent torture scenes and Geena Davis spouting dialogue like, “Suck my dick,” but if cynical Christmas movies are your thing, this one is tough to beat. —JH There are many horrible Christmas movies Netflix has inflicted upon the world, from “The Christmas Prince” to “Hot Frosty.” Easily the best, and a genuine treat to treasure, is Sergio Pablos’ wonderful animated confection “Klaus.” An origin story of sorts for Santa, in which he’s a reclusive toymaker in a distant Northern town befriended and aided by a lazy postal worker, “Klaus” could easily verge on the silly: do we really need a prequel to the Santa mythos? But the film just works, with a sweet message preaching the importance of generosity and the perfect mix of humor and heart. And the film also looks gorgeous, using detailed, gorgeously lit 2D animation to bring its winter wonderland to life. —WC The holidays can provide a lovely opportunity to spend quality time with our loved ones. But, as great artists like Éric Rohmer understand so well, they can be deeply isolating weeks for single people without an obvious place to go. Random meetings with strangers can escalate into deeper connections than you might find at any other time of year — but holidays are inherently ephemeral, and many of those newfound friendships and romances are destined to end. “My Night at Maud’s” is a brilliant film about those fleeting holiday connections. Most of its characters don’t start out as strangers, per se, but they wouldn’t be nearly as close of friends at any other time of year. Cold winter nights are broken up by lengthy conversations about Pascal’s Wager, and the romance that seems to loom around the corner is thwarted by the reality that intellectual chemistry need not be indicative of any larger compatibility. The script is Rohmer’s brand of cerebral filmmaking at its absolute best, all building towards a denouement in which nothing really changes externally but everyone is left with a treasured memory. It’s not your stereotypical holiday movie, yet it hits like a snowglobe — a perfectly preserved winter memory you can return to again and again. —CZ A heavily-Tarantino inspired crime comedy, Doug Liman’s “Go” doesn’t exactly scream Christmas cheer. But it’s set around the holidays, with the tantalizing image of a young shirtless Timothy Olyphant with a Santa hat draped on his head providing much of the Yuletide tie-in. Olyphant is just one of many, many young stars in the film, which also features people like Katie Holmes, Sarah Polley, Scott Wolf, and young Jane Krakowski and Melissa McCarthy in small roles. They all liven up the funny, ramshackle story, set across one Christmas Eve night as they try and score drugs, head on an LA trip, and try to entrap a drug dealer. Spiky dialogue and a blindingly fast pace keep the film going like a festive rush that you never wish ends. —WC A warm, funny tableau more than a film, “Christmas Eve in Miller’s Point” is a touch long for a movie so plotless. Luckily, it’s so delightful that it’s hard to actually care. Tyler Thomas Taormina’s painfully accurate portrait of Long Island families — which will ring very close to home to anyone who’s ever grown up taking the LIRR into NYC — features a massive ensemble playing the Balsano family, a large clan who crowd around the table of their matriarch’s home for what seems destined to be the last time. While there’s some business with the rebellious teens (including Francesca Scorsese and Elsie Fisher) sneaking away, “Christmas Eve in Miller’s Point” is mostly content to paint a picture of the stress, anger, and joy that comes from the holiday, and the melancholy inherent to the season. —WC “In Bruges” is only a Christmas movie in the sense that “Die Hard” is a Christmas movie. But cinephiles big and small should still jump at the chance to toast the season with Martin McDonagh — a filmmaker whose knack for delivering violent fairytales to unsuspecting audiences rivals even Santa’s grasp on global gift giving. When Irish hitmen Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) are sent to hide in the Belgian city of Bruges after a botched job, involving a priest and altar boy (yay, Catholic guilt!), they’re met with an ironically cheery setting. Shiny nostalgia can’t keep criminals off the naughty list though, and it’s not long before they’re stuck in a bloody, whipsmart game of cat-and-mouse that makes Chevy Chase and the squirrel from “Christmas Vacation” look like friends. It’s a dazzling testament to McDonagh’s unique ability to balance dark and light, and even as a passive backdrop, winter festivities pair remarkably well with Farrell and Gleeson’s undeniable chemistry. “In Bruges” came out in 2008, years before the Oscar-winning “Banshees of Inisherin” reunited the actors, and Ralph Fiennes’ role as a crime boss here will make you wish he was in that film, too. Watch both and you’ll dream of Little Jenny pulling a flying sleigh. —AF Winona Ryder’s red-headed Kim dancing in the flurries of “snow” beneath Edward’s ice sculpture. That unforgettable image is what takes Tim Burton’s 1990 suburban fairytale from a movie that just so happens to be a Christmas to the status of bonafide holiday classic. Aesthetically wrapped in the magic of the season but with a plot too often devoid of goodwill towards men, “Edward Scissorhands” at once weaponizes the annual stratification that comes with “My consumerist nightmare is better than your consumerist nightmare!” discourse while also allowing its characters to take refuge in the season’s pockets of joy. Featuring a memorable appearance by Vincent Price as Edward’s inventor, the film starring Johnny Depp intertwines a fairly predicated story of an outcast thrust into society with a unique character concept that elevates the rest of his sweet and sorrowful saga. —AF David Lowery’s “The Green Knight” is, canonically, a Christmas story. Sure, the 2021 film takes one of the oldest tales for the fireside in the English language and turns it into a trippy vision-quest interrogating the true nature of honor and morality with some of the lushest, most transporting, most bewildering visuals since “The Fall.” That may not sound too Christmas-y. But on the other hand: Dev Patel. Tell me you don’t want to watch Dev Patel flail around in the mud while you’re digesting your Christmas meal with a straight face; you can’t. Real ones know that “The Green Knight” is a fantastic Christmas movie because, like the best of them, it takes you to a place and a time wholly different from our own, and gets us to feel a little fonder, a little more grateful for our corner of this burning universe. Just be braced, if any normie relatives who happen to join you, you will probably get asked about what happens with the sash two-thirds of the way through. —SS After the production of “Ghostbusters,” Bill Murray took a hiatus from filmmaking that ended (barring a cameo or two) with “Scrooged,” which teamed him with Richard Donner for a blithe, comedic take on “The Christmas Carol” story. Scrooge is now Murray’s Frank Cross, a ruthless TV executive obsessed with financial gain who gets a chance at atonement when a series of ghosts visit him on Christmas Eve to try and help him learn the error of his ways. The film’s script is a little shaky, balancing its more mean-spirited humor with the eventual sentiment somewhat poorly, but it’s all okay when Murray is such a force as the sleezeball at the center. He makes Frank’s redemption sweet despite the script issues, turning the film into a holiday staple single-handedly. Like a lot of Murray films, though, you kinda like him better when he’s being an asshole. —WC Man, if you think your family argues at Christmas. Arguing is, honestly, kind of the premise of “The Lion In Winter.” After all, arguments are much more fun when they’re written by James Goldman — also behind the stellar ‘older people having feelings and also having swords’ film, “Robin and Marian” — and delivered with decades of built-up bombast by Catherine Hepburn and Peter O’Toole. The Anthony Harvey-directed movie finds the restless King Henry II (O’Toole) and the disgraced but still dangerous Eleanor of Aquitaine (Hepburn) thrown together for the Christmas season with their miserable failsons Richard (Anthony Hopkins), Geoffrey (John Castle), and John (Nigel Terry), who might be scheming against their dad. Everybody has feelings, betrayals, mad lusts for power, and a begrudging sense of connection, despite it all. “The Lion In Winter” has some of the biggest showdowns and grandest dialogue of any movie you’ll ever see, Christmas-themed or otherwise. In its largesse, it also has some of the most fun of any movie, Christmas-themed or otherwise. It’s well worth the trip to medieval times, where, as Eleanor sarcastically proclaims, “It’s 1183 and we’re barbarians!” —WC Appearing on IndieWire’s list of the best feminist horror movies ever made, this historic, final girl-defining slasher was directed by Bob Clark. Yes, that Bob Clark: the director behind the family favorite “A Christmas Story” among others. “Black Christmas” and “A Christmas Story” are tonally disparate projects, to be sure. Still, you’ll find a familiar glow akin to the Parker family’s Christmas tree lights framing plenty of frames in the the earlier horror flick: a warm halo around the suspense – and carnage — still to come. Set at a sorority house during the holidays, “Black Christmas” stars Olivia Hussey as protagonist Jess. When menacing phone calls turn to bumps in the night and finally someone turns up dead, our heroine is forced to confront a killer lurking closer than she thinks. With a seriously vexing conclusion — that’s effective but still maddening — “Black Christmas” is best saved for those willing to weather a yuletide nightmare only to come up with metaphoric coal come the ending. —AF “I made my family disappear.” In the role that turned a 10-year-old into a household name, Macaulay Culkin stars as “Home Alone” hero Kevin McAllister. Written and produced by John Hughes with Chris Columbus serving as director, this 1990 slapstick classic follows the MacGyver-esque Kevin after he’s accidentally left behind on his family’s Christmas vacation and forced to battle two home invaders back in his sleepy Chicago suburb. Jazzy Christmas carols and zippy one-liners (“Keep the change, ya filthy animal!”) bind Culkin’s gleeful starring performance to Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern’s brilliant duo of burglars. But it’s Catherine O’Hara’s scenes, melting down as Kevin’s guilty and panicked mom Kate, that give the movie its enduring heart. “Home Alone” was followed up with a 1992 sequel set in New York City, once again starring Culkin, Pesci, Stern, and O’Hara. It’s a lesser movie, but still funny and well worth watching if you don’t already know what happens when Kevin spends a night at the Plaza. —AF Need a break from…everything? Let director Michael Curtiz’s 1954 Christmas spectacle transport you back in time with its old-world cool, polished performances, and gleefully bonkers musical logic. Princes of the silver screen Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye play friends Bob and Phil, who become singing and songwriting partners after nearly dying in World War II. (Like we said, musical logic!) When the men run across sisters Betty and Judy, played by Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen, the four embark on a jazzy journey to the shockingly not-so-snowy Vermont. Say what you will of the Technicolor film’s story, but there’s no debating “White Christmas” contains masterful music. The namesake tune won Best Original Song in 1942 and is prolific enough that it’s likely playing in your head right now. But for this writer, there’s just no beating the imagery evoked in the lesser-known “Snow,” sung by the four stars aboard a train car. (“It won’t be long before we’ll all be there with snow….” “I want to wash my hands, my face and hair with snow….”) —AF There’s an unabashed schmaltziness to writer/director Richard Curtis’ “Love Actually”: a Christmas rom-com that’s at once intoxicatingly cheery in its sentimentality and sharply clever with its intricate design and British wit. Mainly set in London, with one subplot taking us to the French countryside and later Portugal, the 2003 title has become synonymous with a specific story structure. And though that moniker is sometimes doled out disparagingly (here’s looking at you, Garry Marshall’s “Mother’s Day,” “Valentine’s Day,” and “New Year’s Eve”), there’s a reason so many tenderhearted movie lovers keep coming back to it. A star-studded cast — Colin Firth, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Laura Linney, Billy Nighy, and the late Alan Rickman, among others — charm their way through nine holiday tales tied together by character relationships and some iconic wrap-around narration from Hugh Grant, who plays a lovestruck prime minister. —AF Diane Keaton as the warm, thick-glasses-clad mom! Craig T. Nelson as the emotionally open and even-keeled dad! Luke Wilson as the stoner brother! Rachel McAdams as the tote-swinging, crunchy granola sister! Truly, there are very few fictional families that are more of a joy to spend Christmas with than the family Stone — though Sarah Jessica Parker’s uptight girlfriend forced to spend Christmas with them thanks to her boyfriend, a golden boy son played by Dermot Mulroney, would probably disagree. “The Family Stone” wasn’t a particularly well-received film upon release, but 20 years have made this Christmas comedy of errors a staple watch and a classic, and that’s all thanks to the incredible cast that manages the delicate balance between comedy and drama that Thomas Bezucha’s movie offers. McAdams is the standout, but everyone gets a moment to shine, and it’s really hard difficult to think of a better Christmas gift than vegging out to their antics for a second or third or 400th rewatch. —WC The Grinch may reign supreme as cinema’s most instantly recognizable Christmas scoundrel. But Billy Bob Thornton’s titular “Bad Santa,” a conman named Willie T. Soke who once a year teams up with his partner Marcus Skidmore (Tony Cox) to steal from shopping malls in a dastardly Santa scam, easily ranks among the top five holiday movie hooligans. Directed by Terry Zwigoff, this 2003 dark comedy achieves the kind of naughty fun later films (think the aptly named “A Bad Moms Christmas”) would attempt, but with an earnest nastiness that heightens its humor to near-flying sleigh heights. As Willie’s myriad addictions and intense selfishness threaten the criminals’ partnership — against a backdrop of scheming from a cast that includes Lauren Tom and Bernie Mac, plus the much-celebrated performance of then 8-year-old Brett Kelly — the explosively violent fallout forces the titular coal receiver to reconsider his life. “Bad Santa” was eventually followed by 2016’s “Bad Santa 2,” which offers some of the same fun but is significantly more clumsy than the first. —AF Unafraid to challenge the filmmakers who came before her, Greta Gerwig remade “Little Women” in 2019: the triumphant sixth film adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s well-loved tale of four sisters growing up in Massachusetts at the turn of the century. The Best Picture nominee reunited its writer/director with “Lady Bird” star Saoirse Ronan as Jo alongside Emma Watson as Meg, Florence Pugh as Amy, and Eliza Scanlen as Beth. Laura Dern and Bob Odenkirk played the girls’ parents with Timothée Chalamet rounding out the cast as love interest Laurie. Oh, did we mention Meryl Streep? In the most literal sense, “Little Women” is a Christmas film because it sets two pivotal scenes on the holiday. Alcott’s book famously opens with the girls grappling with a meager celebration on Christmas morning: an economic consequence of the American Civil War raging in the background. The second holiday in their story underlines the loss of one of the March sisters in a heartbreaking sequence that marks one of Gerwig’s most successful tragedies. But more than that, the film is brimming with love and sisterly affection as winter provides a fleeting backdrop to the heroines’ individual weighing of sorrow, acceptance, spirit, and defiance. —AF Accept no substitutes. Reject all remakes. If you want the story of a tough as iron and sharp as nails career woman, living in the Big City™ and forced, through a set of comedic circumstances, to pretend to be a farm wife for the holidays, look no further than 1945’s “Christmas In Connecticut.” The cast is lights-out incredible, anchored by Barbara Stanwyck as a woman’s advice columnist who’s never baked a pie, forced to return to her “family home” in Connecticut to present some homemaking bona fides for her oblivious publisher and ably abetted by Dennis Morgan as a navy man (it is 1945) who Stanwyck bring in from the cold, if you know what I mean. But the supporting ensemble is an embarrassment of riches. You could power TCM for a week off of each of them: Sydney Greenstreet, S.Z. Sakall, Una O’Connor, Reginald Gardiner. This movie is just fun, in that good old-fashioned way, sparking and charming and directed with a spritely touch by Peter Godfrey. Many other films run exactly the same playbook as “Christmas In Connecticut.” But there are very few who run it better. —SS “Last Holiday” wouldn’t stand out in the metaphoric rom-com Christmas tree lot without shining star Queen Latifah perched atop its scraggly story. When a terminally ill woman discovers her health insurance won’t cover the price of a necessary operation (seriously dark, but that’s American healthcare for you!), she decides to blow the last of her money on a solo vacation to the Czech Republic. With LL Cool J as her strapping love interest, Latifah’s Georgia breathes endless life into a wintery adventure that sees her new outlook seriously confusing hotel staff and guests. A case of mistaken identity (with an extra layer of irony, once you know the film’s ending) leads Georgia down a bow and holly-adorned adventure of fine dining, mud masks, snowboarding, and pissing off Timothy Hutton’s pompous antagonist that’s nothing if not fun. —AF National Lampoon’s Vacation franchise consists of four films starring Chevy Chase and Beverly D’Angelo. (There’s five if you count the 2015 reboot with Ed Helms and Christina Applegate, and six if you count the straight-to-video spinoff “Christmas Vacation 2”: a Randy Quaid vehicle from 2003 that barely makes it out of the metaphoric parking lot.) While there are merits to each of these harebrained family trips/events — particularly the original 1983 outing to Wally World directed by the late Harold Ramis — few would deny that writer/producer John Hughes and director Jeremiah S. Chechik’s “Christmas Vacation” is a top-of-the-tree, crowning achievement for the series. Reprising their parts as Clark and Ellen Griswold, Chase and D’Angelo are joined by the best ensemble cast the franchise ever saw with a sprawling family that’s only sometimes lovable but always believable. The 1985 comedy boasts supporting performances from then-kid actors Juliette Lewis and Johnny Galecki — the best Griswold kids ever cast — as well as Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Nicholas Guest as the Griswolds’ memorably awful neighbors. (“Why is the carpet all wet, Todd?” “I don’t know, Margo.”) —AF Before the (surprisingly demanding?) era of Airbnb, swapping homes for Christmas break provided a romantic premise for Nancy Meyers’ “The Holiday.” Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz star as a Brit and an American — both spinning in the wake of infidelity in their relationships — who agree to stay in one another’s homes for the last two weeks of December. Once landed in Los Angeles and London respectively, the women run headlong into two aughts rom-com plots: prepared to their most satisfyingly saccharine. Jude Law plays opposite Diaz as a handsome book editor reeling from the loss of his late wife and struggling to cope with single parenthood. Back in the States, Jack Black charms Winslet as a movie score composer whose affable charisma would make him an obvious love interest, if he wasn’t already taken. Like a crushed-down “Love Actually,” “The Holiday” hits familiar beats but keeps the story fresh with its four-hander structure. —AF Tom Burton’s weirder, freakier “Batman” sequel sets a strange psychosexual tale during Gothem’s holiday season, with Christmas ornaments and snow-covered skyscrapers making for a cheery backdrop to Bruce Wayne’s (Michael Keaton) melancholic battle against the villainous Penguin (Danny DeVito). As the vengeful ghoul runs for mayor and hatches a plan to kidnap the children of Gotham’s elite in a twisted Santa Claus plot, Bruce tangos with Catwoman Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) both in and out of their spandex. Their chemistry makes for maybe the sexiest Christmas movie ever made, particularly when Pfeiffer seductively delivers the oh-so cheesy but oh-so-perfect line, “Mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it. But a kiss can be even deadlier if you mean it.” —WC Set in the winter of 1970 and shot to look as if it had actually been made back then, Alexander Payne’s nuanced and hyper-literate “The Holdovers” takes great pleasure in defying every impulse of modern cinema from even before the moment it starts (the studio fanfare includes a “throwback” Focus Features logo, which is a cute little in-joke about a company that wasn’t founded until 2002). And yet, it might take even greater pleasure in embracing some of the movies’ most time-honored tropes and traditions. Chief among them: The inviolable rule that anything a school teacher “casually” tells their students in the first act of a film must speak to a core idea of the film itself. In that light, be sure to take notes during the opening scene in which Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti) quotes Cicero to the “vulgar philistines” in his Ancient Civilization class. “Non nobis solum nati sumus.” “Not for ourselves alone are we born.” No spoilers, but that’s definitely going to be on the final exam of “The Holdovers,” which gradually thaws into a slight but sensitive tale about a trio of lonely souls who teach each other to push through their lives’ most isolating disappointments. —DE Let’s be real: “Gremlins 2” is significantly more fun than its 1984 predecessor. If you don’t already know that in your bones, then you should prioritize seeing the nonseasonal sequel — and possibly its spot-on “Key & Peele” parody — first. That said, “Gremlins” is the holiday half of Joe Dante’s creature duology, and it has more than enough zip to satisfy fans of ’80s camp looking for a quintessential horror holiday. When a traveling salesman (the late Hoyt Axton) brings home a strange new pet for his son, known as a “mogwai,” hero Billy Peltzer (Zach Gilligan) is tasked with abiding by three rules of care: no sunlight, no water, and no feeding it after midnight. Naturally, it takes no time at all for Billy to screw up and unleash the consequences of his adorable Christmas present on his unsuspecting town. “Gremlins” qualifies as top holiday viewing not only because its zany antics take place at Christmas, but because it also includes one of the most baffling beats in “Home Alone” director Chris Columbus’ screenwriting history. Truly, Phoebe Cates’ infamous Santa-in-a-chimney monologue is one tonal mystery that keeps on giving. —AF What do NYPD detective John McClane and classic holiday singer Bing Crosby have in common? They’ll both be home for Christmas. John McTiernan’s “Die Hard” chronicles the ill-fated reunion of Bruce Willis’ starring action hero and his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) at her company’s Christmas party in Los Angeles. McClane’s plans to win his wife back come undone when a high-stakes heist disguised as a terrorist attack takes over the festivities thanks to Alan Rickman’s notorious villain Hans Gruber. At its core, “Die Hard” is a tale of redemption. Sure, he’s not as on-the-nose naughty as the Grinch or Scrooge, but McClane is paying for past mistakes through the hellish ordeal that unfolds before/beneath/beside/above him in an explosive act of absolution. Even more memorable is the story of Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson), an LAPD officer whose history on the force motivates the film’s heroic climax. If that worthy Christmas message isn’t reason enough for you to check it out, then trust that the script is full of holiday gems: from saccharine platitudes (“It’s Christmas, Theo! It’s the time of miracles…”) to season’s greetings (“Yippee-ki-yay, motherfuckers!”) —AF Bob Clark’s “A Christmas Story” has a rhythmic familiarity for some families: celebrated each year in an all-day marathon on TBS, seamlessly looping from Ralphie’s initial request for a Red Ryder carbine-action BB gun (that’s the “200-shot, range model air rifle with a compass in the stock and this thing that tells time,” of course) to the warm glow of Christmas morning when he discovers whether or not his dream present made it in under the tree. Along the way, Jean Shepherd, who co-wrote the script with Clark and Leigh Brown (not to mention narrates as an older Ralphie), imbues the Parker family with details from his real life, first appearing in his short stories. The road-weary marriage of Melinda Dillon and Darren McGavin’s Mrs. and Mr. Parker stands out as a testament to parents pushing to their absolute limits to make Christmas miracles. —AF Not to be confused with its 1994 remake (though the Mara Wilson vehicle does have its moments), 1947’s “Miracle on 34th Street” is the masterwork of writer/director George Seaton that continues to shape how New Yorkers honor the holidays. The black-and-white film stars Edmund Gwenn as Kris Kringle: the new Santa at a Macy’s department store who shocks the city when he claims to be the real Saint Nick. An 8-year-old Natalie Wood plays Susan: a little girl whose faith in Kringle becomes central to the fairytale’s message. “Miracle on 34th Street” was nominated in multiple categories at that year’s Oscars, including Best Picture. It won three: two for writing and one for Gwenn, who clinched Best Supporting Actor. —AF There are two film adaptations of Charles Dickens’ “A Christmas Carol” appearing on this list, with many, many more available. And though Brian Henson’s 1992 family favorite ranks lower than its competition, we can confidently say it’s got the better puppets. With Kermit the Frog (performed by Steve Whitmire) as its Bob Cratchit and Michael Caine playing Ebenezer Scrooge, “The Muppet Christmas Carol” stays remarkably close to its Gothic source material: a smart grounding move that heightens the film’s bursts of Muppet parody to among the funniest in the ongoing franchise. Come for the promise of punny characters (Fozziewig!) and catchy musical numbers (“It feels like Chriiistmaaas!”). Stay for the goofy witticisms only the Muppets can do justice: “You’re a little absent-minded, spirit.” “No, I’m a large absent-minded spirit!” —AF The holidays are a time of joy, but they’re also bittersweet. “The Apartment” is one of the great melancholy Christmas films, a movie about being lonely and blue during that confusing period between Christmas and New Year’s. Jack Lemmon stars as meek office drone Baxter, who uses his bachelor pad to get ahead in his career by loaning it out as an affair spot for his married superiors. But when his office crush, elevator operator Fran (Shirley MacLaine, luminous), engages in an affair with the head of the company, he’s forced to reconsider the morals of what he’s doing, and what he really wants out of his life. It’s not the most cheery Christmas film of all time, but its perfectly awkward office holiday party scene and running joke about sending a fruitcake to a person whose heart you broke every December 25 firmly establish it in the sad Christmas canon. —WC The swan song of legendary Swedish auteur Ingmar Bergman, “Fanny and Alexander” is an epic in miniature, capturing the lives of two young children born to a wealthy family as they contend with death and abuse but find comfort in themselves and their large extended family. The film, which in its uncut form runs over five hours long, begins with an extended act showcasing the decadent celebrations of the Ekdahl family across Christmas — a relatively secular tradition in which even the Jewish uncle Isak is allowed to partake. The warmth and joy on display (it’s one of the most gorgeous Christmas parties in film history) make the rest of the film — where the siblings’ father dies, and their mother remarries to a severe and abusive Protestant bishop — all the more stark in their cold isolation. Through the contrast between these two methods of religious celebration, “Fanny and Alexander” is one of the few Christmas films to seriously contend with the religion of Christianity itself, asking questions about the role spirituality plays in our lives, and whether it can lead one to happiness or ruin. —WC Its sunny yellow Miami lighting doesn’t scream Christmas. But “Tangerine,” Sean Baker’s breakout film, is very much of the season, taking place entirely on Christmas Eve. The madcap dramedy stars Kitana Kiki Rodriguez as Sin-Dee, a sex worker released from a short jail stint who discovers her boyfriend has been cheating on her. Enraged, she recruits her fellow prostitute and friend Alexandra (Mya Taylor) to help her find him. The film largely focuses on the two engaging in some very non-Christmas activities, from screaming fights to smoking meth. But their sweet friendship and almost sisterly bond keep the film of the season: if the holidays are about family, then the found family relationship seen in “Tangerine” is one of the best. —WC Satoshi Kon is best known for his mind-bending, meta films like “Paprika” or “Perfect Blue,” movies that toy with ideas of self-perception, delusion, and identity. But between those enigmatic releases, he dropped “Tokyo Godfathers,” a bittersweet tragicomedy Christmas film rooted in the down-and-out lives of ordinary people in modern-day Japan. The result is still one of the most offbeat and unusual Christmas films ever made, and also one of the most heartwarming. Heavily inspired by John Ford’s 1948 Western “3 Godfathers,” “Tokyo Godfathers” moves that story of gunslingers attempting to shepherd a baby to safety to Tokyo, where our heroes are three homeless people who find an abandoned child in the trash on Christmas Eve. Their journey across the city to find the kid’s parents is difficult and alternates between hilarious and sobering, but there’s an affection for these unlikely heroes that shines through the jokes. It’s a lovely look at the unluckiest of people during the season of giving. —WC For even some readers who first encountered the ghostly tale of Ebeneezer Scrooge on the page, the late Scottish actor Alastair Sim is the face of literature’s most famed redemptive protagonist. Directed by Brian Desmond Hurst, this 1951 black-and-white adaptation of “A Christmas Carol” — also known as “Scrooge” — enjoys an otherworldly quality emanating from its now-antiquated filmmaking and Dickens’ illustrious prose: exploring the supernatural side to Christmas in a winding story of a greedy businessman confronting his misdeeds via poltergeist. Sim’s turn as Scrooge sees the seasoned actor dexterously scale the philosophical work’s Jacob’s ladder, guiding the unlikely hero from a horror-esque villain to a soft-smiled man making peace with his life. He’d lead Guy Hamilton’s “An Inspector Calls” as the titular inspector calling just two years later, in 1954. —AF Will Ferrell brings the Christmas spirit and then some in Jon Favreau’s fish-out-of-water (elf-out-of-snow?) 2003 comedy about an effervescent Christmas enthusiast visiting gritty New York City. After spending his entire life with Santa in the North Pole, Buddy the Elf arrives in Manhattan like a breath of syrup/candy/spaghetti-infused air: challenging his nasty Scrooge of an estranged father (the late James Caan) to accept his seemingly boundless love and affection. From picking out an ill-conceived gift for that “special someone” to cutting down a tree in Central Park (a serious and illegal whoopsie!), “Elf” is chockfull of familiar traditions twisted to their most misguided and extreme. It’s a crowdpleaser not just for fans of Ferrell and kids who grew up in the aughts, but anyone needing a reason to enjoy the season. After all, say it with me: “The best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear.” —AF “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is often used and recorded as a light, jubilant, or romantic song. But the iconic standard, as introduced by a sprightly Judy Garland in “Meet Me in St. Louis,” is actually a massive downer, a desperate attempt at comfort and happiness during a loved one’s darkest hour. Garland, whose rich voice has never been more beautiful, performs the song in the technicolor Vincente Minnelli musical as hopeless romantic Esther to her little sister Tootie (Margaret O’Brien) after they discover their father will be moving the whole family away from their home. It’s meant to comfort Tootie, but also herself, as she will be ripped away from the boy she loves right after he proposed to her. The scene on Christmas Eve is the only part of “Meet Me in St. Louis” that actually focuses on the holidays, but its perfect blend of melancholy and beauty makes the film an essential entry in the Christmas canon. —WC Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara will knock the breath from your chest in Todd Haynes’ “Carol.” Adapted for the screen by Phyllis Nagy, from Patricia Highsmith’s 1952 “The Price of Salt,” this lesbian period romance (a subgenre done to death, we know) chronicles the swelling attraction between the shop girl/aspiring photographer Therese Belivet and the magnetic soon-to-be divorcee Carol Aird. At first blush, one might clump the women’s love story — featuring clandestine looks framed in artificial snow and an understated meet-cute involving a Santa hat — with other seasonal romances, such as “You’ve Got Mail” or “Love Actually” (also appearing on this list). But where those romantic comedies cut their lovers’ budding tension with holiday antics, “Carol” dares to stare deep into the melancholy thoughtfulness that comes with this time of year by incorporating a heart-rending story of a gay woman fighting to be with her daughter. The result gifts romance fans a slow-burn consideration of the bold futures we choose to allow ourselves and a final shot that will make your heart grow three sizes. —AF It’d be a little cliched to crown director Frank Capra’s “It’s a Wonderful Life” the best Christmas movie of all time: what with the seemingly endless references and homages to it appearing in other holiday films. And yet, to deny hero George Bailey’s all-time heartbreaker one of the top spots feels just about as nice list-qualifying as denying Santa his cookies. Plus, who really needs to justify giving a James Stewart performance — arguably, his best (though the legendary actor would only win an Oscar for 1940’s “The Philadelphia Story”) — supreme accolades? Based on Philip Van Doren Stern’s “The Greatest Gift,” this 1946 black-and-white fable considers the melancholia and existential despair characteristic for so many at the holidays. When news of a man’s suicidal thoughts reach heaven, Henry Travers’ guardian angel character Clarence Odbody intervenes. For those with a heavy heart this time of year — or any for that matter — “It’s a Wonderful Life” offers a hopeful salve from an old world. —AF It takes a special kind of balding, depressed, zig-zag-wearing kid to anchor not one, not two, but three major holiday specials. Four if you count “It’s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown,” “A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving,” “A Charlie Brown Christmas,” and “A Charlie Brown Valentine” (though that last one might be on the fringes of modern popularity and there are other lesser titles we’re not mentioning). After Lucy asks Charlie Brown to direct the Christmas play, he’s thrust into a challenging leadership position that sees him battling Schroeder’s piano and the rest of the gang’s antics for attention. Simultaneously, Linus considers the biblical origins of the holiday and ponders what we owe to one another. The best friends’ journeys meet at night in a cold lot, where Charlie Brown picks out what may very well be the most instantly recognizable Christmas tree in TV and film history. —AF Stanley Kubrick’s final movie is unlike any other of the holly-jolly titles on this list, but there’s no denying the late filmmaker had something to say about Christmas with his sordid tale of a husband and wife’s thorny encounter with an underground sex cult. Finished just days before Kubrick’s death, “Eyes Wide Shut” stars Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise as a raw nerve of a couple whose growing resentment culminates in a would-be affair spun out of control. Tinsel and lights offer an obvious (and ominously gorgeous) seasonal background for the film, released in July 1999. But it’s Kubrick’s repeated presentation of the holiday’s innate consumerism that drives home his thesis — or at least one interpretation of a thesis! — that marriages and families can be hungrily consumed by the vapid mundanity of self-obsession and competitive capitalism. —AF Not just one of the greatest Christmas rom-coms, but one of the greatest rom-coms period, “The Shop Around the Corner” and its tale of pen pals falling in love during the Christmas season has been adapted and modernized several times, such as in the Broadway musical “She Loves Me” or ’90s email film “You’ve Got Mail.” But Ernst Lubitsch’s original, based on the play “Parfumerie,” remains the greatest telling. In the Budapest leathergoods shop where they work, Klara (Margaret Sullavan) and Alfred (James Stewart) bicker endlessly, but in the anonymous letters they write to each other, they both reveal their softer sides and find themselves smitten with the stranger they don’t know. Both actors are phenomenal, with beautiful simple chemistry that’s alternatively spiky and sweet. They’re supported by a lovely cast, including Frank Morgan as the owner of the store Matuschek who discovers his wife is having an affair. What makes the film such a holiday great is its exploration of lonlieness during the winter months, from the two leads struggling to find love to Matuschek’s despair over his situation. It’s a simple but moving story about finding connection, and how love and companionship can be the greatest gift of all. —WC By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

Title: Netflix needs Warner Bros.’s IP and franchises to remain the default streaming service
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/08/netflix-warner-bros-deal-ip-franchises-default-streaming-service-ai/

Good morning. There’s a lot of debate over last week’s surprise announcement that Netflix struck an $83 billion deal to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery. President Donald Trump said Sunday that their combined market share “could be a problem,” and the deal will face international scrutiny, too. Some takeaways so far: Warner Bros. held out for a bigger shared win. An insider told me that Warner Bros. chief David Zaslav was not eager to partner with Paramount Skydance because of financing, the price, and the fact that rookie CEO David Ellison would not only retain controlling shares but was still digesting his last win. Activate Consulting CEO Michael J. Wolf, a veteran media consultant and former president of MTV Networks, argues that this deal is a must-do for Netflix, given the rising strength of competitors like YouTube, Amazon Prime and Tubi. “No doubt Netflix is the default streaming service,” Wolf told me over the weekend. “Going forward, what will be required to win is more iconic IP and more global franchises that work everywhere. Warner Bros. Discovery is one of the only companies out there that will give Netflix both of these at once.” Experience matters. Content and the ability to distribute it have fueled many an entertainment merger. But history is filled with examples of those who’ve generated huge value for stakeholders from such deals and many that did not. The AOL Time Warner merger proved to be an expensive cautionary tale about clashing cultures, mistimed market shifts and the perils of buying at peak bubble. (Time Warner’s Turner acquisition, on the other hand, was a home run.) I remember GE CEO Jeff Immelt telling me “we know this world” when merging VivendiUniversal and NBC. Turns out GE didn’t create as much value as NBC Universal’s subsequent buyer Comcast did. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos is right to say that “our mission has always been to entertain.” But even if he overcomes antitrust scrutiny, he must then win over Hollywood, investors and consumers who already balk at the idea of this new behemoth. AI is changing the game. We’ve already seen how much AI is changing the entertainment game, with AI-generated actor Tilly Norwood, AI influencers, Coca-Cola commercials, and movies. Since Netflix is a longtime builder—versus a buyer—some wonder if the streamer is interested in Warner Bros.’ deep library for reasons other than simply giving consumers more stuff to consume. As Melissa Otto, head of research at S&P Global Visible Alpha, told Fortune, the future of entertainment may come down to who owns what she calls “the video corpus” to train and power the next generation of AI models. Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com China’s $1 trillion trade surplus President Trump’s tariffs weren’t enough to rein in China’s exports. The country’s trade surplus blew past $1 trillion for the first time this year, with one month to spare. China’s exports to the U.S. have plummeted, falling 29% in November year-on-year, but shipments to other countries, especially in southeast Asia, have soared, making up the difference. IBM’s big AI deal IBM is reportedly in talks to buy Confluent, a company that manages real-time flow of data in big AI models, in a deal worth $11 billion. The acquisition would be IBM’s largest in recent years; the tech giant announced it was slashing thousands of jobs in November in a shift towards AI. Apple’s C-Suite shakeup Four Apple executives who report to CEO Tim Cook have stepped down in the past week, marking a major shakeup at the tech giant known for C-Suite stability that’s hampering its effort to catch up in the AI race. Deutsche Bank pay bump Deutsche Bank wants to boost the pay of its supervisory board chair, Alexander Wynaendts, who is already the highest-paid chair in Germany’s Dax 40 companies. Germany’s largest lender will ask shareholders to approve a 47% bump for Wynaendts, which will take his pay to roughly $1.6 million. Rate cut expectations Wall Street analysts expect Fed chair Jerome Powell to announce another rate cut following the central bank’s meeting this week but to hold off on signaling a January cut as he balances dovish and hawkish committee members. Bank of America analysts wrote on Friday that Powell will have a hard time sending “a credibly hawkish signal” as important jobs and consumer data will be released between this week’s meeting and the one in January. China’s newest AI billionaire A homegrown Chinese chipmaker, Moore Threads Technology Co., staged China’s second-largest IPO of the year on Friday, raising $1.1 billion. Its stock rocketed 425% in its Shanghai debut, making co-founder Zhang Jianzhong, an ex-Nvidia executive, a billionaire and giving momentum to China’s push for chip self-sufficiency. Moving on from the Metaverse Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is leaving the Metaverse behind as the company announced it is cutting 30% from the budget of the lab responsible for the project, per Bloomberg. The experiment that Zuckerberg once described as the “successor to the mobile internet” has accumulated $70 billion in losses since 2021. S&P 500 futures were up 0.13% this morning. The last session closed up 0.19%. STOXX Europe 600 was flat in early trading. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was down 0.08% in early trading. Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.18%. China’s CSI 300 was up 0.81%. The South Korea KOSPI was up 1.34%. India’s NIFTY 50 is down 0.86%. Bitcoin is up at $92K.

Title: The Defining Artworks of 2025

By Francesca Aton, Brian Boucher, Daniel Cassady, Anne Doran, Maximilíano Durón, Alex Greenberger, Harrison Jacobs, Tessa Solomon, Emily Watlington December 8, 2025 5:00am By some measures, democracy is in downward decline in quite a few countries across the world, while censorship is only increasing. (A coincidence? Hardly.) But even with so much valid concern about the fragility of the world order more broadly, artists pressed ahead in 2025, producing valuable works that contended with police violence, abuses of power, fallen monuments, climate change, and trans rights. This list taking stock of the 25 artworks that defined the year includes many pieces confronting these issues. Not every work here is a protest, of course; there are also pieces that conjure science-fictional worlds and new possibilities for abstraction. (Not every artwork is even particularly great—we’ve included one piece we really didn’t like but found significant nonetheless.) But in a time when freedom of expression is under threat, just about any kind of art feels political in its own way. This list is a reminder that artists can, and will, forge onward, even in the darkest moments. It’s also a reminder that artists did just that in the past, too. To complement the new and recent artworks featured here, we’ve also roped in some older pieces that speak well to our current mood. These works show that history is unsettled—particularly at a time when some political forces would prefer for the past to remain set in stone. —Alex Greenberger We loved Adrien Brody in The Pianist (2002) and The Brutalist (2024), but “the artist” is a role he is unable to master, judging by the ridiculously bad, overdetermined products on view in his summer show “Made in America,” in which he portrayed iconic characters like Mickey Mouse and Marilyn Monroe, who artists great (Warhol) and not-so-great (KAWS, Banksy) have long since worked with. But the show was seemingly all anyone could talk about. In another great movie, The Matrix (1999), when Joe Pantoliano’s character is going to be plugged back into the fake world, he says, “I want to be rich. Someone important. Like an actor.” But even some actors, with all their money and fame, deep down, just want to be artists. Is that at least something that artists can feel good about? —Brian Boucher As hysteria over AI reached a fever pitch this year, artists began tackling the technology’s implications in refreshingly off-kilter ways. Shanghai-born, Tokyo-based artist Lu Yang is a case in point. Though the artist has been creating videos, installations, and interactive works featuring his virtual avatar Doku since 2020, this year Yang debuted a new installation, DOKU the Creator, that became the talk of Art Basel Hong Kong. (It later traveled in a modified form to the Amant art space in Brooklyn.) The piece is a sensory overload of an installation anchored by an hour-long video in which Doku moves through a surreal dreamscape that blends video game animation with AI-generated imagery. In Hong Kong, the video was presented inside an interactive installation that included a pop-up store. Works were sold in “blind boxes,” each hiding one of 108 possible pieces—a setup that laid bare the casino-like nature of the art market. The video and its surrounding environment evoke an art world in which the artist is no longer essential to the system’s functioning. Doku appears to operate autonomously, free to create, destroy, and mourn the value of art without any mediation by its creator. What distinguishes Yang’s work from other AI critiques is that he seems unbothered by this state of affairs. Drawing on Buddhist philosophy, he suggests that all creation functions like an algorithm—endlessly combining and recombining the totality of human thought and creativity into conceptual forms. Our mistake, he implies, is in attaching too much meaning to the artist, or their originality, at all. In the end, they are all temporary illusions. —Harrison Jacobs Surrealism—which just celebrated its 100th anniversary—is having a moment even as its canon grows ever more inclusive, with rising auction prices for Surrealist works by women, a run of expansive institutional shows like 2022’s “Surrealism Beyond Borders,” and growing interest in formerly underknown figures such as Les Lalanne. A case in point is the Museum of Modern Art’s current Wifredo Lam retrospective, on view through April 11, which presents the Cuban Surrealist painter as a transformative figure rather than an exotic offshoot of a primarily European movement. Of Chinese and African descent, Lam was deliberate about using Afro-Caribbean imagery in his works, famously telling art historian Gerardo Mosquera that his art was “an act of decolonization.” A highlight of MoMA’s exhibition is Lam’s painting Grande Composition (1949), which features a hybrid horse-human taken from the African diasporic religion Santería. The work epitomizes Lam’s belief in what he told Mosquera was “the importance of bringing the Black presence into art.”—Anne Doran Invited to create a work for the Guggenheim’s 1963 Pop Art exhibition “Six Painters and the Object,” artist Harold Stevenson produced The New Adam, a 40-foot-long wraparound painting of a nude man. (Actor Sal Mineo was the model for the body; the partially obscured face is that of Stevenson’s lover at the time, British aristocrat Timothy Willoughby.) It was rejected by the show’s curator Lawrence Alloway, who wrote, “[The] problem . . . is publicity, rumor, and all those entertaining things which would go along with exhibiting a nude with a phallus the size of a man.” More than 60 years later the time finally seems right for Stevenson’s gargantuan canvas, which not only celebrates the male body but expresses homosexual desire at a scale impossible to ignore. It is currently on view through January 19 in the Whitney Museum of American Art’s exhibition “Sixties Surreal.” —Anne Doran Few works in 2025 carried the cultural and political weight of Un coro de yicas (A chorus of yicas), the centerpiece of Claudia Alarcón and Silät’s exhibition at James Cohan. The installation—composed of 100 hand-woven yica bags—made visible a lineage of Wichí women whose textile knowledge has been passed down by generations and until recently dismissed as craft. Each yica is made using chaguar fibers harvested, processed, spun, dyed, and woven through a communal, intergenerational labor system that Alarcón learned at age 12. The work crystallizes what their practice represents: not formalist abstraction but a living language, a structure of communication, memory, and autonomy passed from mothers to daughters across the Alto la Sierra and La Puntana communities in Argentina. Seen together, the 100 bags operate as both archive and chorus, a collective declaration of presence at a moment when Indigenous women’s labor is finally being recognized as contemporary art. —Daniel Cassady This mixed-media sculpture by Ser Serpas featured in the MoMA PS1 exhibition “The Gatherers,” which brought together the work of artists whose practices collect and accumulate various forms of detritus in a world that is increasingly wasteful and on the brink of environmental collapse. Serpas is one such young artist who has injected new energy into this form of assemblage. Her installation, titled tube of brief cadavers made sadder still, might on its surface resemble a trash heap at a dump, but the two main items juxtaposed together—a plastic orange saddle-like contraption that could be part of a boat, and shredded silver fabric recalling emergency blankets—lend the piece a connotation of migrants fleeing by sea. Its haunting title seems to confirm that allusion, memorializing those who do not make the crossing and, more recently, those who are being targeted in such boats. —Maximilíano Durón The history of Japanese internment—when the United States government detained and imprisoned its own citizens—never seems to loom as large within American consciousness as it should. Perhaps that might change with Bruce Yonemoto’s Broken Fences, which debuted in the Hammer Museum’s “Made in L.A.” biennial this year, where it emerged as one of the show’s standouts. For the piece, Yonemoto has constructed two fence-like armatures into which he has embedded video screens. On the screens play two sets of propaganda—sometimes side by side, sometimes separately: one produced by the U.S. War Relocation Authority documenting the deportation of Japanese Americans, and one created by the Nazis about the Theresienstadt concentration camp. Both falsely promote the supposed “benefits” of these detentions. (The work’s dominating audio, however, comes from the German propaganda film.) Yonemoto poignantly underscores how two opposing wartime powers deployed strikingly similar visual and rhetorical tools, drawing a chilling parallel between their methods and the ideologies they served.—Maximilíano Durón More so than any other artist this year, South Korean phenom Ayoung Kim took the American art press by storm, with her work appearing on the cover of simultaneous issues of Artforum and Frieze this fall. (ARTnews also profiled her around that time, too.) There’s good reason to be suspicious of any artist who receives so much attention so suddenly, but Kim is the real deal, as proven by her current MoMA PS1 exhibition and a Performa commission staged this past November. The centerpiece of her PS1 show is this video installation, one of three chapters in a trilogy of works about motorcycle-riding female delivery workers who seem to attract and antagonize each other. Projected onto three formidably sized screens that hang from the ceiling, Kim’s footage switches seamlessly between imagery made using gaming engines and AI, and often displays impossibly tall ramps and staircases in futuristic worlds. Those worlds may not look ours, but the workers who scale them are navigating a capitalistic rat race that feels a lot like the one of the present. —Alex Greenberger The mercurial pop-music star Lorde tapped the art world in a number of ways in the promotional push around her fourth studio album Virgin, including a video that alluded to Walter De Maria’s seminal Land art work The New York Earth Room and, in a booklet that accompanied the vinyl LP, a bare-it-all picture of a waist in see-through pants by photographer Talia Chetrit. But the cover of the album was the master stroke: an X-ray image of a pelvis by Heji Shin. Bones in the arresting image are joined by a zipper (the same one as in the pants in Chetrit’s photo?) and an IUD. —Andy Battaglia This one’s very meta. When climate protestors threw soup on Van Gogh’s sunflowers and mashed potatoes on Monet’s haystacks, their detractors decried defacing any art. Never mind that all their targets were protected with plexiglas, a veneer made from fossil fuels poetically shielding these human-produced views of nature, which apparently seemed more precious to some than nature itself. Beyond the ragebait headlines, the boring moralist should-they-or-shouldn’t-theys, the protestors’ gesture blurred protest and art in more ways than one. A series by Goldin+Senneby honors the Just Stop Oil group’s conceptual heft while turning cries of conservation on their head. Working with professional conservators, the duo meticulously recreated each splattered plexi vitrine to scale, showing them against blank walls and turning them into paintings themselves. You can bask in their irreverent glory at the MIT List Visual Arts Center, where I first saw them, through mid-March. —Emily Watlington This is a game: Move your mouse across a digital landscape, select your drone’s target, press “X” for death. In Domestic Tension, Iraqi American artist Wafaa Bilal argues that this is the numbing ease of modern warfare—where the distance between people and their would-be killers has been so thoroughly abstracted that devastation can be delivered from an office chair. The piece stands as an example of what Bilal has called a “networked performance.” He confined himself to a Chicago gallery for its duration, broadcasting live online 24/7 and inviting viewers to chat, observe, or—if they were so mysteriously compelled—shoot him with a robotically-controlled paintball gun. (Non-lethal bullets still hurt.) Domestic Tension simulated the unending anxiety faced by Iraqis worldwide, forced to anticipate violence—whether physical, like a US-made bomb, or existential, as the so-called War on Terror legitimized racism: it’s acceptable to fire, so long as the target is Arab. —Tessa Solomon On most days, David Zwirner’s townhouse on New York’s Upper East Side functions well as a domestic space converted into white-cube gallery, but during the run of P. Staff’s remarkable show there this fall, the building’s spiral staircase was occasionally drenched in a haunting shades of blue. The source of that emanation was Penetration, a video projected across all three of the gallery’s floors, in which a figure stands stoically in a darkened space. A laser beam shoots through the void, aimed directly at this person’s stomach. What did that mean? Never one to let viewers off the hook easily, Staff did not offer many clues, though those familiar with the artist’s past work might recognize in this video a statement on the surveillance of bodies that do not conform to conservative gender norms. That kind of violence is endemic right now in the US—the Trump administration recently announced a measure that would keep trans Americans from changing their gender on their passports—but Staff notably did not explicitly portray it. Sometimes, everyday life is scary enough. —Alex Greenberger The trend of women painting women and calling it “feminist” has been brewing for some time, but it exploded this autumn in what I dubbed “feminist figuration fall.” Yet there is a clear divide between work trafficking in—and profiting from—pastiche and normative fantasy, and those building new, feminist worlds. Amid it all, Gordon’s show at David Zwirner stood out. In this particular painting, luminous skin glows eerily green and is punctuated with cellulite and stretch marks. Meanwhile, each of our subject’s long hairs are rendered individually. Gordon stands naked in this self-portrait save for a pair of black kitten heels, not just echoing Manet’s Olympia but talking back to it. The work both repels and allures at the same time, drawing you in, then challenging all your first impressions. She’s not relying on normative ideas of beauty as a crutch so much as reimagining what beauty might be. —Emily Watlington The difficulty of trying to remember all the little details in Laura Owens’s brain-bending painting/installation/show at Matthew Marks Gallery rhymes with the way that those details were hard to discern even when in their presence, in real time. The artist’s brush had bristled and stroked different dimensions, making for trompe l’oeil effects that twisted into spirals while turning inside-out and back again. Here too were traces of “painting” (as well as sly admonitions of it), as evident on the walls as they were on canvases that almost seemed to play a supporting role. Moving through the hidden door connecting the show’s two main spaces—each adorned with paintings of wallpaper and inexplicable things like pretzels floating in the air, and one with tiny mechanical panels that opened to reveal still more painting inside—gave rise to the most thrilling idea of an “art gallery” rather than the too-often humdrum reality of one. —Andy Battaglia This piece is a monumental act of witnessing: a 23-hour video drawn entirely from footage of U.S. State Department press briefings spanning October 2023 to January 2025, the end of the Biden administration. What begins with a journalist politely stating “I have a couple of questions” becomes an epic portrait of governmental irresponsibility as reporters—bleary, persistent, increasingly furious—try and fail to obtain clarity on Israel, Palestine, and the United States’s role therein. By editing out the spokesmen’s evasive, nothingburger replies, with cuts at times turning officials’ remarks into syllable salads, Reynolds and Ochshorn leave only the questions, revealing the briefings as a looping theater of deflection. It’s a horror film without the jump cuts: we watch the State Department rebrand its atrocities through the art of PR, confident in its own immunity. Presented without commentary, the footage indicts by showing instead of telling: this system will neither acknowledge its hypocrisies nor confront the human cost of its policies. As the genocide escalates and trust erodes, the journalists’ inquiries move from specific facts toward procedural and ethical pleas—“How do you know?” “Is there any plan?”—questions that echo far beyond the room. The film stands as one of the year’s most urgent artworks, a stark record of accountability sought and systematically denied. —Emily Watlington The beginning of the year saw Los Angeles hit by devastating wildfires, including the Eaton Fire, which decimated parts of Altadena, an unincorporated part of Los Angeles County that for generations has been home to a thriving hub of Black creativity. In response, Kenturah Davis created an embossed editioned print that featured a vintage map of Altadena onto which she had rubbed pigment that incorporated soil from outside her home, which burned in the fires. Altadena featured in an exhibition mounted by the California African American Museum just months after the wildfires to reflect on the immense loss and featured three generations of the Davis family. A work like Davis’s is a testament to the community’s resilience: from the ashes, a new Altadena will rise. —Maximilíano Durón How does one represent Palestine? It’s a question that has plagued artists and writers throughout the last century, as even the most seemingly anondyne depictions can’t help but become freighted with meaning and political valence—a tendency that has only grown since October 7 and Israel’s war in Gaza. In a work commissioned for the Taipei Biennial, Omar Mismar lands on a towering sculpture of flowers. The work is suffused with an unending grief, with the flowers evoking the ones placed typically at a tombstone. But Mismar is after something more complicated: the flowers are artificial, made out of fabric and modeled after illustrations found in Flowers of Palestine (1870), a book by Swiss missionary Hanna Zeller. Here, Mismar tackles a contradiction inherent in the idea of Palestine: some of the most detailed preservations of the land and culture were those created from a colonial gaze. The flowers do not wilt or smell. They are forever perfect, if inert. But read another way, Palestine remains an idea that will not wilt or die, due in no small part to the grief it inspires. —Harrison Jacobs More often than not—and often for the worse—US history is a work of fiction at the mercy of its makers. This provocation animates Stan Douglas’s five-channel film installation, Birth of a Nation (2025), which reframes one of cinema’s most insidious legacies of white supremacy: the 110-year-old Klan rallying cry that shares its name. For it, Douglas, a keen reader of the messages smuggled into our media, constructed an alternative narrative to a pivotal 13-minute section of D. W. Griffith’s original film, in which a Black soldier named Gus pursues a young white woman to the edge of a cliff. Though this is a tragic case of misidentification, the woman ultimately leaps to her death to escape his designs, a moment intended by the film to obliterate any sympathies that still stood for formerly enslaved Black Americans at the height of Jim Crow; the soldier—played by a white actor in blackface—is later lynched. While this scene loops on one screen, the other four present alternate outcomes of the same sequence of events made possible by new perspectives included in Douglas’s script. The characters are released from their crude casts of “villain,” “damsel,” and “hero,” and open the possibility that viewers, too, might question how they’ve looked away from a clearer, more complex picture of the powers shaping our prejudices. —Tessa Solomon Sometimes, an artwork gains new importance for reasons that are less than fortunate, and that was the case when Thomas J. Price’s Grounded in the Stars visited Times Square over the summer. The piece had already appeared elsewhere, generating little controversy in the process, but when Grounded in the Stars came to New York, the sculpture suddenly gained the attention of conservative reactionaries, who mocked Price’s piece online, remaking it in racist memes and as AI slop. What, exactly, was so offensive about a 12-foot-tall statue of a Black woman standing around? Most of the sculpture’s detractors seemed to deflect the question in social media tirades and op-eds, though it was clear that a larger debate about monuments—who deserves to be represented with them, and who they are for—hung in the background. With Trump now calling for the reinstatement of monuments that were “removed or changed to perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history” in 2020 or afterward, pieces like Grounded in the Stars suddenly seem even more essential. —Alex Greenberger More than a decade after Pussy Riot cofounder Nadya Tolokonnikova was incarcerated in Russia, the artist returned to a prison of her own making in her performance installation Police State (2025) at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles this June. Tolokonnikova reimagined her prison cell as a space for art—a form of reclamation not only for herself but also for the Russian, Belarusian, and American prisoners whose pieces were incorporated into the installation. Inside, visitors could observe Tolokonnikova making music or art, or even resting throughout the day, via security camera footage and peepholes. The eerie authoritarian state came to life extended beyond MOCA, however, when anti-ICE protests erupted and the National Guard was deployed. With Police State unexpectedly closed to the public during the protests, Tolokonnikova continued staging the work in private, underscoring the piece’s continued relevance amid the ongoing political conflicts in the US and abroad. —Francesca Aton You can basically count on art by being censored for obscenity and support of matters like the Palestinian cause. But how can a simple flag cause trouble? That’s at the heart of the mystery behind Replacement by Cameron Rowland. Shown at the Palais de Tokyo as part of the show “Echo Delay Reverb,” the piece consisted simply of the flag of Martinique, an overseas department of France, flown above the Paris institution where a French flag is typically hung. Martinicans have fought for freedom from French rule for centuries, the artist pointed out in an accompanying text, and the flag replaced the customary French one. Within a day, the Palais de Tokyo removed the work, posting a text noting that the piece may be “considered illegal.” How? No one has elaborated. Score one for the power of the most minimal artistic gestures to cause a ruckus. —Brian Boucher In 2016, Jade Guanaro Kuriki-Olivo staged a performance called Liberté, in which performers of various gender identities dressed as the Statue of Liberty, turning a common New York tourist attraction into a kind of drag show. Nine years and two Trump administrations later, Kuriki-Olivo created a sequel in the form of Liberté Morte (Dead Liberty), a sculpture in which a Statue of Liberty costume is splayed out on a plinth. It was a a darker, more sinister approach that responded to the increased marginalization of trans people in the US between Trump administrations, and it suggested that freedom—a fragile notion right now—may be as good as dead in America. —Francesca Aton Trans Forming Liberty (2024), a painting depicting the Black trans-femme model and performance artist Arewà Basit carrying a torch à la the Statue of Liberty, made its debut last year at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in Amy Sherald’s survey “American Sublime.” It didn’t cause controversy there or at the Whitney Museum, where the exhibition went next. But before the show traveled to the Smithsonian-run National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C., the museum reportedly tried to remove the painting, leading Sherald to cancel the exhibition and allege censorship. Instead of shying away, Sherald told the New Yorker that the work “demands a fuller vision of freedom, one that includes the dignity of all bodies, all identities. Liberty isn’t fixed. She transforms, and so must we.” The painting thus became a symbol of protest—and even served as the cover for the August 11 issue of the New Yorker. —Francesca Aton The notion that history repeats itself is both a cliché and a truth, and it is one that Barbara Kruger has always considered in her work, which often finds her remaking the same textual statements about power using the same signature font, just in different settings. Featuring such phrases as “WHO IS BEYOND THE LAW?,” Untitled (Questions) ended up proving Kruger’s point when it figured so prominently in the background of the anti-ICE protests that roiled Los Angeles over the summer. Pictures of the National Guard standing beneath Kruger’s mural, sited at the Geffen Contemporary venue of the Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles, seemed to answer the artist’s questions well enough, so it was hardly a shock when the photographs went viral. What was more surprising was just how closely those pictures mirrored ones taken in the same place in 1992, when the National Guard was deployed to LA to quell demonstrations following Rodney King’s beating by members of the Los Angeles Police Department. In 2018, Kruger said of Untitled (Questions), “It’s both tragic and disappointing that this work, 30 years later, might still have some resonance.” Seven years on, it remains both tragic and disappointing that Kruger is always right. —Alex Greenberger There’s something familiar yet uncanny about Kara Walker’s Unmanned Drone, which this year served as the focal point of The Brick’s portion of the “Monuments” exhibition. For this towering sculpture, Walker dissected and dismembered a decommissioned statue of Stonewall Jackson atop his horse, Little Sorrel, that once stood outside a courthouse in Charlottesville, Virginia. The original, unveiled in 1921 and made by Charles Keck, stood 13 feet high and 16 feet long. Walker’s version is just as monumental but deliberately fragmented, deconstructing the myth built around Jackson in the decades following the Civil War to prop up the falsehoods of the Lost Cause—namely, that had Jackson not met an untimely death, the Confederacy would have won. By taking apart the statue and soldering it back together so that Jackson’s and Sorrel’s body parts merge in confounding, often grotesque ways, Walker lays bare the mechanics of myth-making. She shows how the building blocks of racist historical narratives can appear too large to dismantle but, in fact, can be slowly unraveled to expose the lies beneath.—Maximilíano Durón The World's Premier Art Magazine since 1913.

Google and Amazon are aggressively developing their own AI chips (TPUs, Trainium3) to reduce reliance on Nvidia, signaling a shift toward self-reliance in AI hardware. Despite a 2.5% stock dip due to Google's potential TPU deal with Meta, Nvidia maintains confidence in its generational lead, with Blackwell/Rubin chips sold out through 2026. Hyperscalers' ASICs offer cost efficiency for specific workloads, but Nvidia's GPUs and CUDA ecosystem remain unmatched for versatility across industries (AI, gaming, robotics, etc.). U.S.-China tech wars and export restrictions push China (via Huawei) to develop domestic alternatives, but Nvidia's short-term dominance persists as the AI chip market rapidly expands. While hyperscalers carve out niches, Nvidia's entrenched infrastructure (NVLink, software) ensures ongoing relevanceâbut long-term leadership depends on innovation amid rising competition.

While hyperscalers carve out niches, Nvidia's entrenched infrastructure (NVLink, software) ensures ongoing relevanceâbut long-term leadership depends on innovation amid rising competition. The AI revolution is reshaping the tech landscape at breakneck speed, and nowhere is this more evident than in the semiconductor industry. Nvidia has long been the undisputed leader in AI hardware, powering everything from cloud computing to autonomous vehicles with its cutting-edge GPUs. But recent developments suggest that Big Tech giantsâparticularly Google and Amazonâare making aggressive moves to reduce their reliance on Nvidia by developing and even selling their own AI chips. The latest shockwave came with reports that Google could soon sell its custom Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to Meta in a deal potentially worth billions. This sent Nvidia's stock tumbling 2.5% in a single day, signaling investor concerns that one of Nvidia's biggest customers might soon become a competitor. Meanwhile, Amazon unveiled its Trainium3 chip, boasting a 50% cost reduction in AI training compared to alternatives. While Nvidia remains confidentâclaiming its technology is still a generation aheadâthe question looms: Is the AI chip market shifting beneath Nvidia's feet? Google and Amazon aren't just buying Nvidia's GPUsâthey're designing their own specialized AI processors known as ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits). Unlike Nvidia's general-purpose GPUs, ASICs are optimized for specific workloads, making them highly efficient for certain AI tasks. "Google knows their requirements and can optimize their chips accordingly," says Forrester senior analyst Alvin Nguyen. "That doesn't mean their TPUs are superior to Nvidia in every way, but for Google's needs, they can outperform." Amazon's Trainium3 follows a similar logicâtailored for AI training workloads, it promises significant cost savings. But ASICs come with limitations. If a company's AI models evolve, their custom chips may need redesigningâa costly and time-consuming process. That's why hyperscalers like Google and Amazon still buy Nvidia GPUs as a hedge against shifting AI demands. Nvidia's unmatched flexibility Nvidia's strength lies in its versatility. Its GPUs aren't just AI acceleratorsâthey power gaming, robotics, autonomous vehicles and scientific computing. Moreover, Nvidia's CUDA software ecosystem is deeply entrenched in AI development, making its hardware the default choice for many developers. "Nvidia's architecture is transferable across industries," explains Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. "If your model changes, you don't need a new chipâyou just reprogram." Additionally, Nvidia isn't just selling GPUsâit's expanding into networking with NVLink and AI infrastructure solutions. Amazon, despite pushing Trainium3, still relies on Nvidia's NVLink for its servers. This symbiotic relationship means that even as Big Tech builds its own chips, Nvidia remains indispensable. Hyperscalers like Google, Amazon and Microsoft account for roughly 50% of Nvidia's data center revenue. If they shift more workloads to in-house chips, could Nvidia's growth stall? Not necessarily. "The AI chip market is expanding so fast that there's room for multiple players," says Rasgon. While Google and Amazon may carve out niches, Nvidia's Blackwell and Rubin AI chips are already sold out through 2026, with projected revenues nearing $500 billion. Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh sums it up: "Nvidia is still the king." But in the rapidly evolving AI arms race, even kings must adaptâor risk being dethroned. The bigger picture: geopolitics and AI dominance This chip rivalry isn't just about corporate competitionâit's intertwined with U.S.-China tensions. As Washington restricts AI chip exports to Beijing, China is scrambling to develop domestic alternatives. Huawei's Ascend chips pose a long-term threat, but for now, China remains dependent on Nvidia. Meanwhile, Big Tech's push for self-reliance reflects a broader trend: AI is too critical to outsource entirely. Whether Nvidia can maintain its lead hinges on its ability to stay ahead in both hardware and softwareâwhile fending off rivals who once were its biggest customers. One thing is certain: The AI chip wars are just heating up. According to BrightU.AI's Enoch,Â Google and Amazon entering the AI chip arena will intensify competition, leveraging their vast resources and cloud infrastructure to challenge Nvidia's dominance. However, Nvidia's established ecosystem, CUDA platform and first-mover advantage in AI acceleration make it resilientâthough not invincibleâas the market fragments with new players.

Hyperscalers like Google, Amazon and Microsoft account for roughly 50% of Nvidia's data center revenue. If they shift more workloads to in-house chips, could Nvidia's growth stall? Not necessarily. "The AI chip market is expanding so fast that there's room for multiple players," says Rasgon. While Google and Amazon may carve out niches, Nvidia's Blackwell and Rubin AI chips are already sold out through 2026, with projected revenues nearing $500 billion. Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh sums it up: "Nvidia is still the king." But in the rapidly evolving AI arms race, even kings must adaptâor risk being dethroned. The bigger picture: geopolitics and AI dominance This chip rivalry isn't just about corporate competitionâit's intertwined with U.S.-China tensions. As Washington restricts AI chip exports to Beijing, China is scrambling to develop domestic alternatives. Huawei's Ascend chips pose a long-term threat, but for now, China remains dependent on Nvidia. Meanwhile, Big Tech's push for self-reliance reflects a broader trend: AI is too critical to outsource entirely. Whether Nvidia can maintain its lead hinges on its ability to stay ahead in both hardware and softwareâwhile fending off rivals who once were its biggest customers. One thing is certain: The AI chip wars are just heating up. According to BrightU.AI's Enoch,Â Google and Amazon entering the AI chip arena will intensify competition, leveraging their vast resources and cloud infrastructure to challenge Nvidia's dominance. However, Nvidia's established ecosystem, CUDA platform and first-mover advantage in AI acceleration make it resilientâthough not invincibleâas the market fragments with new players.

Sources include: Finance.Yahoo.com BrightU.ai Brighteon.com Google and Amazon aren't just buying Nvidia's GPUsâthey're designing their own specialized AI processors known as ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits). Unlike Nvidia's general-purpose GPUs, ASICs are optimized for specific workloads, making them highly efficient for certain AI tasks. "Google knows their requirements and can optimize their chips accordingly," says Forrester senior analyst Alvin Nguyen. "That doesn't mean their TPUs are superior to Nvidia in every way, but for Google's needs, they can outperform." Amazon's Trainium3 follows a similar logicâtailored for AI training workloads, it promises significant cost savings. But ASICs come with limitations. If a company's AI models evolve, their custom chips may need redesigningâa costly and time-consuming process. That's why hyperscalers like Google and Amazon still buy Nvidia GPUs as a hedge against shifting AI demands. Nvidia's unmatched flexibility Nvidia's strength lies in its versatility. Its GPUs aren't just AI acceleratorsâthey power gaming, robotics, autonomous vehicles and scientific computing. Moreover, Nvidia's CUDA software ecosystem is deeply entrenched in AI development, making its hardware the default choice for many developers. "Nvidia's architecture is transferable across industries," explains Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. "If your model changes, you don't need a new chipâyou just reprogram."

Title: Not share price, not performance, here's what Apple's management exodus hints for the tech giant's future

Apple is witnessing an unusually concentrated wave of senior exits just as it tries to reposition itself for an AI-driven future. A series of exits and impending departures across top management and engineering ranks in recent weeks has raised fresh questions about the stability of the company’s leadership bench — and the readiness of the world’s most valuable firm to accelerate its artificial-intelligence (AI) push. A Yahoo Finance report said that while a quick succession of exits usually signifies a sinking boat, there could be more to this situation. The churn comes at a moment of financial strength: Apple has posted strong quarterly results powered by new iPhone sales, its market value has climbed past $4 trillion, and the stock is trading near record highs. The issue, the report said, isn’t performance—it’s who is leaving, and from which parts of the organization. According to the report, Apple has been under mounting pressure to deliver on AI, a space where critics argue it has fallen behind despite the technology’s transformative potential. Many of the executives now exiting were tied to AI product integration, hardware strategy or design — the very areas Apple needs to lean on as it tries to close the gap. Besides this, CEO Tim Cook is nearing retirement age, and there is big speculation over who will, or can, take over after front-runner Jeff Williams left. Notably, Apple has not explicitly said that the executive changes are AI development-based, but most of those on their way out have been closely associated with its AI product integration or design aspects. Deepwater Asset Management managing partner and longtime Apple watcher Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance, “I think that the changes that have happened are largely because Cook wants to shake things up. And instead of being a follower in AI, he wants to be a leader. So, I think it's more than just a typical transition. I think ... this is a big deal.” A veteran engineer who joined in 2018, with prior experience at Microsoft and Google, Giannandrea's departure was viewed as a strategic move, as Apple continued to lag behind competitors in the AI space, as per various reports. Now filling the role is researcher Amar Subramanya, who moved from corporate Vice President of AI at Microsoft, before which he spent 16 years heading engineering for Google's Gemini digital assistant. He will report to Apple's Senior Vice President of Software Engineering Craig Federighi. Announcing his appointment, Apple cited Subramanya's experience integrating AI into features and products as “important to Apple's ongoing innovation and future Apple Intelligence features”, AFP reported. Commenting on Subramanya's appointment in the company release, Apple CEO Tim Cook said AI is “central to Apple's strategy” and that the new chief will bring “extraordinary AI expertise” to the role. Alan Dye, meanwhile, was involved in the Apple Vision Pro launch and helped with “integrating eye/hand interactions and immersion”. In 2025, he led the design of Liquid Glass and helped unify the design language for iOS, iPadOS, MacOS, watchOS and tvOS. ZK Research founder and principal analyst Zeus Kerravala told Yahoo Finance, “There is a renewed push by Apple to accelerate its AI roadmap, especially after criticism that its earlier AI efforts with Siri ... lagged behind a lot of the rivals. I think what makes Apple kind of unique is they can be behind [in] technology because of the fandom that's around Apple and the ecosystem that they lock people into. I think, from an Apple perspective right now, it's ‘make these changes now, and make sure you are positioned well,’ or you are going to start losing share, eventually.” (With inputs from Agencies) Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

We rely on your support for our independence, diversity and quality. In this section of the November 2025 episode of FO° Exclusive, Atul Singh and Glenn Carle examine growing fears that the US stock market has become detached from economic reality. Inequality, weakening consumer demand and policy time lags now increase systemic risk. Mounting fiscal strain, tariff uncertainty and global diversification away from the dollar make a significant market correction increasingly plausible. This article saved into your bookmarks. Click here to view your bookmarks. Editor-in-Chief Atul Singh and FOI Senior Partner Glenn Carle, a retired CIA officer who now advises companies, governments and organizations on geopolitical risk, discuss rising fears of a US stock market bubble, with particular attention to technology and artificial intelligence. Their concern is not simply that equities are expensive, but that today’s valuations reflect expectations the real economy may be unable to meet. Drawing on warnings by market experts, fiscal data and consumer indicators, they argue that the American economy is showing strains beneath the surface while markets continue to price in near-perfect economic conditions. The gap between financial optimism and economic reality, they suggest, is widening dangerously. The AI boom and extreme market concentration Atul opens by highlighting warnings from Albert Edwards, the global strategist at French bank Société Générale, who sees the US equity market — especially tech and AI stocks — in the midst of a classic bubble. Some major technology firms are trading at roughly 30 times forward earnings, a level Atul calls “a ridiculous figure.” These valuations, Edwards argues, leave little margin for error. The discussion stresses that such optimism depends on extraordinary assumptions. Citing estimates from JPMorgan Chase, Atul notes that for companies to earn a 10% return on projected AI capital expenditure by 2030, they would collectively need around $650 billion in annual AI revenues — roughly $400 per year from every iPhone user. While some fund managers remain bullish, arguing AI-led productivity gains justify this optimism, many investors view the revenue assumptions as implausible. Market gains are also highly concentrated. Roughly 60% of recent stock market growth has come from just seven firms: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. The remaining 40% of the market is up as well, but far less dramatically. This concentration amplifies systemic risk, as any correction among a handful of firms could reverberate across the entire market. Inequality, consumers and the fragile base of demand The US economy ultimately depends on consumer demand, even if that reality is often obscured by soaring asset prices. Glenn underlines that consumption today is increasingly driven by the wealthy. Around 80–86% of the gains from recent tax cuts have flowed to the top 1% of Americans, while the bottom 80% have seen little or no growth in disposable income for years. This imbalance matters because wealthy households cannot replace mass demand. Glenn sums it up starkly: “1,000 billionaires cannot buy as many cars as 100 million lower-middle-class Americans.” If middle- and lower-middle-class consumers cannot afford homes, cars or basic goods, economic momentum weakens regardless of stock prices. Atul turns the conversation to the declining role of entrepreneurs. Building small, innovative firms has become much more difficult as large corporations dominate markets. Historically, smaller companies have driven job creation and experimentation in both the US and Europe. Their erosion, Glenn adds, pushes the economy toward oligopoly — less competition, weaker innovation and slower long-term growth. Time lags, tariffs and mounting economic strain A central theme of the discussion is what Glenn calls the “lag factor” in economic policy. Despite commentators’ claims that new tariffs have had little immediate impact, policy effects take time. Even small changes in short-term interest rates can take around six months to affect the economy, while longer-term rates and fiscal measures often take 18 months or more. Dismissing these delays may prove dangerous. Although tariff revenues have risen and trade flows have not collapsed, uncertainty itself is already affecting behavior. CEOs faced with shifting rules and arbitrary implementation hesitate to make long-term investment decisions. Supporters inside the Trump administration counter by likening the US market to a Disneyland theme park, arguing that trading partners will continue to accept lower margins because there is no substitute — a view closely associated with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who administration insiders credit with engineering a delicate balancing act between trade pressure and market stability. Supporters also point to the US–China trade deal, which they argue removed Chinese export controls on rare earths, halted retaliation against US semiconductor firms and reopened Chinese markets to American agricultural exports. Critics respond that this confidence underestimates how quickly countries adapt when costs rise. Glenn points to rising housing costs, weak youth employment, a growing deficit and slowing construction as indicators of a slowdown in the economy. Atul reinforces this view with insider insights from within Washington, DC. Sources in the US Treasury worry not just about tariffs, but about affordability, cost-of-living pressures and weakening demand. Meanwhile, headline fiscal numbers are troubling. US debt is projected to exceed that of Italy and Greece for the first time this century, while the budget deficit remains near 6% in peacetime. Demand, dislocation and a possible crash Beyond near-term indicators, Atul and Glenn raise a deeper structural concern: demand in an AI-driven economy. Even if AI significantly boosts production and efficiency, it may also displace jobs faster than new ones emerge. Atul likens the situation to the late 1920s, when productivity surged, but demand failed to keep pace, ending in a market collapse. Signs of stress are already showing. University of Michigan consumer confidence fell to 50.3 in November, the second-worst reading ever recorded — worse than during the 2008 global financial crisis or the 2020 Covid-19 downturn. Household balance sheets are also deteriorating: roughly 4.5% of US household debt is now delinquent, while student-loan delinquencies have reached record levels. Youth unemployment has climbed above 8%, and job-search times are lengthening. Simultaneously, while the dollar remains the world’s main trading currency, it is declining as a store of value. Central banks and investors are diversifying away from the mighty greenback. Even allies like Canada are actively seeking to reduce reliance on the US market through shifting trade, tourism and even defense procurement decisions. Importantly, rising market volatility presents a major risk, with the Cboe Volatility Index crossing the 20 mark, signaling higher-than-normal expected market volatility and increased investor uncertainty or fear Investors and economists are increasingly talking of an impending crash. These predictions might be a bit too pessimistic, but dismissing them would be reckless. As Atul puts it, “just because there’s a lot of talk about it doesn’t mean that it is all talk.” Together, the indicators paint a consistent picture: an irrational exuberance in markets, an economy under increasing strains and a growing risk that economic realities upend ebullient markets.

Atul likens the situation to the late 1920s, when productivity surged, but demand failed to keep pace, ending in a market collapse. Signs of stress are already showing. University of Michigan consumer confidence fell to 50.3 in November, the second-worst reading ever recorded — worse than during the 2008 global financial crisis or the 2020 Covid-19 downturn. Household balance sheets are also deteriorating: roughly 4.5% of US household debt is now delinquent, while student-loan delinquencies have reached record levels. Youth unemployment has climbed above 8%, and job-search times are lengthening. Simultaneously, while the dollar remains the world’s main trading currency, it is declining as a store of value. Central banks and investors are diversifying away from the mighty greenback. Even allies like Canada are actively seeking to reduce reliance on the US market through shifting trade, tourism and even defense procurement decisions. Importantly, rising market volatility presents a major risk, with the Cboe Volatility Index crossing the 20 mark, signaling higher-than-normal expected market volatility and increased investor uncertainty or fear Investors and economists are increasingly talking of an impending crash. These predictions might be a bit too pessimistic, but dismissing them would be reckless. As Atul puts it, “just because there’s a lot of talk about it doesn’t mean that it is all talk.” Together, the indicators paint a consistent picture: an irrational exuberance in markets, an economy under increasing strains and a growing risk that economic realities upend ebullient markets.

Pluralistic: Daily links from Cory Doctorow No trackers, no ads. Black type, white background. Privacy policy: we don't collect or retain any data at all ever period. Last night, I gave a speech for the University of Washington's "Neuroscience, AI and Society" lecture series, through the university's Computational Neuroscience Center. It was called "The Reverse Centaur’s Guide to Criticizing AI," and it's based on the manuscript for my next book, "The Reverse Centaur’s Guide to Life After AI," which will be out from Farrar, Straus and Giroux next June: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/future-tense-neuroscience-ai-and-society-with-cory-doctorow-tickets-1735371255139 The talk was sold out, but here's the text of my lecture. I'm very grateful to UW for the opportunity, and for a lovely visit to Seattle! == I'm a science fiction writer, which means that my job is to make up futuristic parables about our current techno-social arrangements to interrogate not just what a gadget does, but who it does it for, and who it does it to. What I don't do is predict the future. No one can predict the future, which is a good thing, since if the future were predictable, that would mean that what we all do couldn't change it. It would mean that the future was arriving on fixed rails and couldn't be steered. Jesus Christ, what a miserable proposition! Now, not everyone understands the distinction. They think sf writers are oracles, soothsayers. Unfortunately, even some of my colleagues labor under the delusion that they can "see the future." But for every sf writer who deludes themselves into thinking that they are writing the future, there are a hundred sf fans who believe that they are reading the future, and a depressing number of those people appear to have become AI bros. The fact that these guys can't shut up about the day that their spicy autocomplete machine will wake up and turn us all into paperclips has led many confused journalists and conference organizers to try to get me to comment on the future of AI. That's a thing I strenuously resisted doing, because I wasted two years of my life explaining patiently and repeatedly why I thought crypto was stupid, and getting relentless bollocked by cryptocurrency cultists who at first insisted that I just didn't understand crypto. And then, when I made it clear that I did understand crypto, insisted that I must be a paid shill. This is literally what happens when you argue with Scientologists, and life is Just. Too. Short. So I didn't want to get lured into another one of those quagmires, because on the one hand, I just don't think AI is that important of a technology, and on the other hand, I have very nuanced and complicated views about what's wrong, and not wrong, about AI, and it takes a long time to explain that stuff. But people wouldn't stop asking, so I did what I always do. I wrote a book. Over the summer I wrote a book about what I think about AI, which is really about what I think about AI criticism, and more specifically, how to be a good AI critic. By which I mean: "How to be a critic whose criticism inflicts maximum damage on the parts of AI that are doing the most harm." I titled the book The Reverse Centaur's Guide to Life After AI, and Farrar, Straus and Giroux will publish it in June, 2026. But you don't have to wait until then because I am going to break down the entire book's thesis for you tonight, over the next 40 minutes. I am going to talk fast. # Start with what a reverse centaur is. In automation theory, a "centaur" is a person who is assisted by a machine. You're a human head being carried around on a tireless robot body. Driving a car makes you a centaur, and so does using autocomplete. And obviously, a reverse centaur is machine head on a human body, a person who is serving as a squishy meat appendage for an uncaring machine. Like an Amazon delivery driver, who sits in a cabin surrounded by AI cameras, that monitor the driver's eyes and take points off if the driver looks in a proscribed direction, and monitors the driver's mouth because singing isn't allowed on the job, and rats the driver out to the boss if they don't make quota. The driver is in that van because the van can't drive itself and can't get a parcel from the curb to your porch. The driver is a peripheral for a van, and the van drives the driver, at superhuman speed, demanding superhuman endurance. But the driver is human, so the van doesn't just use the driver. The van uses the driver up. Obviously, it's nice to be a centaur, and it's horrible to be a reverse centaur. There are lots of AI tools that are potentially very centaur-like, but my thesis is that these tools are created and funded for the express purpose of creating reverse-centaurs, which is something none of us want to be. But like I said, the job of an sf writer is to do more than think about what the gadget does, and drill down on who the gadget does it for and who the gadget does it to. Tech bosses want us to believe that there is only one way a technology can be used. Mark Zuckerberg wants you to think that it's technologically impossible to have a conversation with a friend without him listening in. Tim Cook wants you to think that it's technologically impossible for you to have a reliable computing experience unless he gets a veto over which software you install and without him taking 30 cents out of every dollar you spend. Sundar Pichai wants you think that it's impossible for you to find a webpage unless he gets to spy on you from asshole to appetite. This is all a kind of vulgar Thatcherism. Margaret Thatcher's mantra was "There is no alternative." She repeated this so often they called her "TINA" Thatcher: There. Is. No. Alternative. TINA. "There is no alternative" is a cheap rhetorical slight. It's a demand dressed up as an observation. "There is no alternative" means "STOP TRYING TO THINK OF AN ALTERNATIVE." Which, you know, fuck that. I'm an sf writer, my job is to think of a dozen alternatives before breakfast. So let me explain what I think is going on here with this AI bubble, and sort out the bullshit from the material reality, and explain how I think we could and should all be better AI critics. # Start with monopolies: tech companies are gigantic and they don't compete, they just take over whole sectors, either on their own or in cartels. Google and Meta control the ad market. Google and Apple control the mobile market, and Google pays Apple more than $20 billion/year not to make a competing search engine, and of course, Google has a 90% Search market-share. Now, you'd think that this was good news for the tech companies, owning their whole sector. But it's actually a crisis. You see, when a company is growing, it is a "growth stock," and investors really like growth stocks. When you buy a share in a growth stock, you're making a bet that it will continue to grow. So growth stocks trade at a huge multiple of their earnings. This is called the "price to earnings ratio" or "P/E ratio." But once a company stops growing, it is a "mature" stock, and it trades at a much lower P/E ratio. So for every dollar that Target – a mature company – brings in, it is worth ten dollars. It has a P/E ratio of 10, while Amazon has a P/E ratio of 36, which means that for every dollar Amazon brings in, the market values it at $36. It's wonderful to run a company that's got a growth stock. Your shares are as good as money. If you want to buy another company, or hire a key worker, you can offer stock instead of cash. And stock is very easy for companies to get, because shares are manufactured right there on the premises, all you have to do is type some zeroes into a spreadsheet, while dollars are much harder to come by. A company can only get dollars from customers or creditors. So when Amazon bids against Target for a key acquisition, or a key hire, Amazon can bid with shares they make by typing zeroes into a spreadsheet, and Target can only bid with dollars they get from selling stuff to us, or taking out loans, which is why Amazon generally wins those bidding wars. That's the upside of having a growth stock. But here's the downside: eventually a company has to stop growing. Like, say you get a 90% market share in your sector, how are you gonna grow? Once the market decides that you aren't a growth stock, once you become mature, your stock is revalued, to a P/E ratio befitting a mature stock. If you are an exec at a dominant company with a growth stock, you have to live in constant fear that the market will decide that you're not likely to grow any further. Think of what happened to Facebook in the first quarter of 2022. They told investors that they experienced slightly slower growth in the USA than they had anticipated, and investors panicked. They staged a one-day, $240B sell off. A quarter-trillion dollars in 24 hours! At the time, it was the largest, most precipitous drop in corporate valuation in human history. That's a monopolist's worst nightmare, because once you're presiding over a "mature" firm, the key employees you've been compensating with stock, experience a precipitous pay-drop and bolt for the exits, so you lose the people who might help you grow again, and you can only hire their replacements with dollars. With dollars, not shares. And the same goes for acquiring companies that might help you grow, because they, too, are going to expect money, not stock. This is the paradox of the growth stock. While you are growing to domination, the market loves you, but once you achieve dominance, the market lops 75% or more off your value in a single stroke if they don't trust your pricing power. Which is why growth stock companies are always desperately pumping up one bubble or another, spending billions to hype the pivot to video, or cryptocurrency, or NFTs, or Metaverse, or AI. I'm not saying that tech bosses are making bets they don't plan on winning. But I am saying that winning the bet – creating a viable metaverse – is the secondary goal. The primary goal is to keep the market convinced that your company will continue to grow, and to remain convinced until the next bubble comes along. So this is why they're hyping AI: the material basis for the hundreds of billions in AI investment. # Now I want to talk about how they're selling AI. The growth narrative of AI is that AI will disrupt labor markets. I use "disrupt" here in its most disreputable, tech bro sense. The promise of AI – the promise AI companies make to investors – is that there will be AIs that can do your job, and when your boss fires you and replaces you with AI, he will keep half of your salary for himself, and give the other half to the AI company. That's it. That's the $13T growth story that MorganStanley is telling. It's why big investors and institutionals are giving AI companies hundreds of billions of dollars. And because they are piling in, normies are also getting sucked in, risking their retirement savings and their family's financial security. Now, if AI could do your job, this would still be a problem. We'd have to figure out what to do with all these technologically unemployed people. But AI can't do your job. It can help you do your job, but that doesn't mean it's going to save anyone money. Take radiology: there's some evidence that AIs can sometimes identify solid-mass tumors that some radiologists miss, and look, I've got cancer. Thankfully, it's very treatable, but I've got an interest in radiology being as reliable and accurate as possible. If my Kaiser hospital bought some AI radiology tools and told its radiologists: "Hey folks, here's the deal. Today, you're processing about 100 x-rays per day. From now on, we're going to get an instantaneous second opinion from the AI, and if the AI thinks you've missed a tumor, we want you to go back and have another look, even if that means you're only processing 98 x-rays per day. That's fine, we just care about finding all those tumors." If that's what they said, I'd be delighted. But no one is investing hundreds of billions in AI companies because they think AI will make radiology more expensive, not even if that also makes radiology more accurate. The market's bet on AI is that an AI salesman will visit the CEO of Kaiser and make this pitch: "Look, you fire 9/10s of your radiologists, saving $20m/year, you give us $10m/year, and you net $10m/year, and the remaining radiologists' job will be to oversee the diagnoses the AI makes at superhuman speed, and somehow remain vigilant as they do so, despite the fact that the AI is usually right, except when it's catastrophically wrong. "And if the AI misses a tumor, this will be the human radiologist's fault, because they are the 'human in the loop.' It's their signature on the diagnosis." This is a reverse centaur, and it's a specific kind of reverse-centaur: it's what Dan Davies calls an "accountability sink." The radiologist's job isn't really to oversee the AI's work, it's to take the blame for the AI's mistakes. This is another key to understanding – and thus deflating – the AI bubble. The AI can't do your job, but an AI salesman can convince your boss to fire you and replace you with an AI that can't do your job. This is key because it helps us build the kinds of coalitions that will be successful in the fight against the AI bubble. If you're someone who's worried about cancer, and you're being told that the price of making radiology too cheap to meter, is that we're going to have to re-home America's 32,000 radiologists, with the trade-off that no one will ever be denied radiology services again, you might say, "Well, OK, I'm sorry for those radiologists, and I fully support getting them job training or UBI or whatever. But the point of radiology is to fight cancer, not to pay radiologists, so I know what side I'm on." AI hucksters and their customers in the C-suites want the public on their side. They want to forge a class alliance between AI deployers and the people who enjoy the fruits of the reverse centaurs' labor. They want us to think of ourselves as enemies to the workers. Now, some people will be on the workers' side because of politics or aesthetics. They just like workers better than their bosses. But if you want to win over all the people who benefit from your labor, you need to understand and stress how the products of the AI will be substandard. That they are going to get charged more for worse things. That they have a shared material interest with you. Will those products be substandard? There's every reason to think so. Earlier, I alluded to "automation blindness, "the physical impossibility of remaining vigilant for things that rarely occur. This is why TSA agents are incredibly good at spotting water bottles. Because they get a ton of practice at this, all day, every day. And why they fail to spot the guns and bombs that government red teams smuggle through checkpoints to see how well they work, because they just don't have any practice at that. Because, to a first approximation, no one deliberately brings a gun or a bomb through a TSA checkpoint. Automation blindness is the Achilles' heel of "humans in the loop." Think of AI software generation: there are plenty of coders who love using AI, and almost without exception, they are senior, experienced coders, who get to decide how they will use these tools. For example, you might ask the AI to generate a set of CSS files to faithfully render a web-page across multiple versions of multiple browsers. This is a notoriously fiddly thing to do, and it's pretty easy to verify if the code works – just eyeball it in a bunch of browsers. Or maybe the coder has a single data file they need to import and they don't want to write a whole utility to convert it. Tasks like these can genuinely make coders more efficient and give them more time to do the fun part of coding, namely, solving really gnarly, abstract puzzles. But when you listen to business leaders talk about their AI plans for coders, it's clear they're not looking to make some centaurs. They want to fire a lot of tech workers – 500,000 over the past three years – and make the rest pick up their work with coding, which is only possible if you let the AI do all the gnarly, creative problem solving, and then you do the most boring, soul-crushing part of the job: reviewing the AIs' code. And because AI is just a word guessing program, because all it does is calculate the most probable word to go next, the errors it makes are especially subtle and hard to spot, because these bugs are literally statistically indistinguishable from working code (except that they're bugs). Here's an example: code libraries are standard utilities that programmers can incorporate into their apps, so they don't have to do a bunch of repetitive programming. Like, if you want to process some text, you'll use a standard library. If it's an HTML file, that library might be called something like lib.html.text.parsing; and if it's a DOCX file, it'll be lib.docx.text.parsing. But reality is messy, humans are inattentive and stuff goes wrong, so sometimes, there's another library, this one for parsing PDFs, and instead of being called lib.pdf.text.parsing, it's called lib.text.pdf.parsing. Now, because the AI is a statistical inference engine, because all it can do is predict what word will come next based on all the words that have been typed in the past, it will "hallucinate" a library called lib.pdf.text.parsing. And the thing is, malicious hackers know that the AI will make this error, so they will go out and create a library with the predictable, hallucinated name, and that library will get automatically sucked into your program, and it will do things like steal user data or try and penetrate other computers on the same network. And you, the human in the loop – the reverse centaur – you have to spot this subtle, hard to find error, this bug that is literally statistically indistinguishable from correct code. Now, maybe a senior coder could catch this, because they've been around the block a few times, and they know about this tripwire. But guess who tech bosses want to preferentially fire and replace with AI? Senior coders. Those mouthy, entitled, extremely highly paid workers, who don't think of themselves as workers. Who see themselves as founders in waiting, peers of the company's top management. The kind of coder who'd lead a walkout over the company building drone-targeting systems for the Pentagon, which cost Google ten billion dollars in 2018. For AI to be valuable, it has to replace high-wage workers, and those are precisely the experienced workers, with process knowledge, and hard-won intuition, who might spot some of those statistically camouflaged AI errors. Like I said, the point here is to replace high-waged workers. And one of the reasons the AI companies are so anxious to fire coders is that coders are the princes of labor. They're the most consistently privileged, sought-after, and well-compensated workers in the labor force. If you can replace coders with AI, who cant you replace with AI? Firing coders is an ad for AI. Which brings me to AI art. AI art – or "art" – is also an ad for AI, but it's not part of AI's business model. Let me explain: on average, illustrators don't make any money. They are already one of the most immiserated, precartized groups of workers out there. They suffer from a pathology called "vocational awe." That's a term coined by the librarian Fobazi Ettarh, and it refers to workers who are vulnerable to workplace exploitation because they actually care about their jobs – nurses, librarians, teachers, and artists. If AI image generators put every illustrator working today out of a job, the resulting wage-bill savings would be undetectable as a proportion of all the costs associated with training and operating image-generators. The total wage bill for commercial illustrators is less than the kombucha bill for the company cafeteria at just one of Open AI's campuses. The purpose of AI art – and the story of AI art as a death-knell for artists – is to convince the broad public that AI is amazing and will do amazing things. It's to create buzz. Which is not to say that it's not disgusting that former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati told a conference audience that "some creative jobs shouldn't have been there in the first place," and that it's not especially disgusting that she and her colleagues boast about using the work of artists to ruin those artists' livelihoods. It's supposed to be disgusting. It's supposed to get artists to run around and say, "The AI can do my job, and it's going to steal my job, and isn't that terrible?" Because the customers for AI – corporate bosses – don't see AI taking workers' jobs as terrible. They see it as wonderful. But can AI do an illustrator's job? Or any artist's job? Let's think about that for a second. I've been a working artist since I was 17 years old, when I sold my first short story, and I've given it a lot of thought, and here's what I think art is: it starts with an artist, who has some vast, complex, numinous, irreducible feeling in their mind. And the artist infuses that feeling into some artistic medium. They make a song, or a poem, or a painting, or a drawing, or a dance, or a book, or a photograph. And the idea is, when you experience this work, a facsimile of the big, numinous, irreducible feeling will materialize in your mind. Now that I've defined art, we have to go on a little detour. I have a friend who's a law professor, and before the rise of chatbots, law students knew better than to ask for reference letters from their profs, unless they were a really good student. Because those letters were a pain in the ass to write. So if you advertised for a postdoc and you heard from a candidate with a reference letter from a respected prof, the mere existence of that letter told you that the prof really thought highly of that student. But then we got chatbots, and everyone knows that you generate a reference letter by feeding three bullet points to an LLM, and it'll barf up five paragraphs of florid nonsense about the student. So when my friend advertises for a postdoc, they are flooded with reference letters, and they deal with this flood by feeding all these letters to another chatbot, and ask it to reduce them back to three bullet points. Now, obviously, they won't be the same bullet-points, which makes this whole thing terrible. But just as obviously, nothing in that five-paragraph letter except the original three bullet points are relevant to the student. The chatbot doesn't know the student. It doesn't know anything about them. It cannot add a single true or useful statement about the student to the letter. What does this have to do with AI art? Art is a transfer of a big, numinous, irreducible feeling from an artist to someone else. But the image-gen program doesn't know anything about your big, numinous, irreducible feeling. The only thing it knows is whatever you put into your prompt, and those few sentences are diluted across a million pixels or a hundred thousand words, so that the average communicative density of the resulting work is indistinguishable from zero. It's possible to infuse more communicative intent into a work: writing more detailed prompts, or doing the selective work of choosing from among many variants, or directly tinkering with the AI image after the fact, with a paintbrush or Photoshop or The Gimp. And if there will ever be a piece of AI art that is good art – as opposed to merely striking, or interesting, or an example of good draftsmanship – it will be thanks to those additional infusions of creative intent by a human. And in the meantime, it's bad art. It's bad art in the sense of being "eerie," the word Mark Fisher uses to describe "when there is something present where there should be nothing, or there is nothing present when there should be something." AI art is eerie because it seems like there is an intender and an intention behind every word and every pixel, because we have a lifetime of experience that tells us that paintings have painters, and writing has writers. But it's missing something. It has nothing to say, or whatever it has to say is so diluted that it's undetectable. The images were striking before we figured out the trick, but now they're just like the images we imagine in clouds or piles of leaves. We're the ones drawing a frame around part of the scene, we're the ones focusing on some contours and ignoring the others. We're looking at an inkblot, and it's not telling us anything. Sometimes that can be visually arresting, and to the extent that it amuses people in a community of prompters and viewers, that's harmless. I know someone who plays a weekly Dungeons and Dragons game over Zoom. It's transcribed by an open source model running locally on the dungeon master's computer, which summarizes the night's session and prompts an image generator to create illustrations of key moments. These summaries and images are hilarious because they're full of errors. It's a bit of harmless fun, and it bring a small amount of additional pleasure to a small group of people. No one is going to fire an illustrator because D&D players are image-genning funny illustrations where seven-fingered paladins wrestle with orcs that have an extra hand. But bosses have and will fire illustrators, because they fantasize about being able to dispense with creative professionals and just prompt an AI. Because even though the AI can't do the illustrator's job, an AI salesman can convince the illustrator's boss to fire them and replace them with an AI that can't do their job. This is a disgusting and terrible juncture, and we should not simply shrug our shoulders and accept Thatcherism's fatalism: "There is no alternative." So what is the alternative? A lot of artists and their allies think they have an answer: they say we should extend copyright to cover the activities associated with training a model. And I'm here to tell you they are wrong: wrong because this would inflict terrible collateral damage on socially beneficial activities, and it would represent a massive expansion of copyright over activities that are currently permitted – for good reason!. Let's break down the steps in AI training. First, you scrape a bunch of web-pages. This is unambiguously legal under present copyright law. You do not need a license to make a transient copy of a copyrighted work in order to analyze it, otherwise search engines would be illegal. Ban scraping and Google will be the last search engine we ever get, the Internet Archive will go out of business, that guy in Austria who scraped all the grocery store sites and proved that the big chains were colluding to rig prices would be in deep trouble. Next, you perform analysis on those works. Basically, you count stuff on them: count pixels and their colors and proximity to other pixels; or count words. This is obviously not something you need a license for. It's just not illegal to count the elements of a copyrighted work. And we really don't want it to be, not if you're interested in scholarship of any kind. And it's important to note that counting things is legal, even if you're working from an illegally obtained copy. Like, if you go to the flea market, and you buy a bootleg music CD, and you take it home and you make a list of all the adverbs in the lyrics, and you publish that list, you are not infringing copyright by doing so. Perhaps you've infringed copyright by getting the pirated CD, but not by counting the lyrics. This is why Anthropic offered a $1.5b settlement for training its models based on a ton of books it downloaded from a pirate site: not because counting the words in the books infringes anyone's rights, but because they were worried that they were going to get hit with $150k/book statutory damages for downloading the files. OK, after you count all the pixels or the words, it's time for the final step: publishing them. Because that's what a model is: a literary work (that is, a piece of software) that embodies a bunch of facts about a bunch of other works, word and pixel distribution information, encoded in a multidimensional array. And again, copyright absolutely does not prohibit you from publishing facts about copyrighted works. And again, no one should want to live in a world where someone else gets to decide which truthful, factual statements you can publish. But hey, maybe you think this is all sophistry. Maybe you think I'm full of shit. That's fine. It wouldn't be the first time someone thought that. After all, even if I'm right about how copyright works now, there's no reason we couldn't change copyright to ban training activities, and maybe there's even a clever way to wordsmith the law so that it only catches bad things we don't like, and not all the good stuff that comes from scraping, analyzing and publishing. Well, even then, you're not gonna help out creators by creating this new copyright. If you're thinking that you can, you need to grapple with this fact: we have monotonically expanded copyright since 1976, so that today, copyright covers more kinds of works, grants exclusive rights over more uses, and lasts longer. And today, the media industry is larger and more profitable than it has ever been, and also: the share of media industry income that goes to creative workers is lower than its ever been, both in real terms, and as a proportion of those incredible gains made by creators' bosses at the media company. So how it is that we have given all these new rights to creators, and those new rights have generated untold billions, and left creators poorer? It's because in a creative market dominated by five publishers, four studios, three labels, two mobile app stores, and a single company that controls all the ebooks and audiobooks, giving a creative worker extra rights to bargain with is like giving your bullied kid more lunch money. It doesn't matter how much lunch money you give the kid, the bullies will take it all. Give that kid enough money and the bullies will hire an agency to run a global campaign proclaiming "think of the hungry kids! Give them more lunch money!" Creative workers who cheer on lawsuits by the big studios and labels need to remember the first rule of class warfare: things that are good for your boss are rarely what's good for you. The day Disney and Universal filed suit against Midjourney, I got a press release from the RIAA, which represents Disney and Universal through their recording arms. Universal is the largest label in the world. Together with Sony and Warner, they control 70% of all music recordings in copyright today. It starts: "There is a clear path forward through partnerships that both further AI innovation and foster human artistry." It ends: "This action by Disney and Universal represents a critical stand for human creativity and responsible innovation." And it's signed by Mitch Glazier, CEO of the RIAA. It's very likely that name doesn't mean anything to you. But let me tell you who Mitch Glazier is. Today, Mitch Glazier is the CEO if the RIAA, with an annual salary of $1.3m. But until 1999, Mitch Glazier was a key Congressional staffer, and in 1999, Glazier snuck an amendment into an unrelated bill, the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act, that killed musicians' right to take their recordings back from their labels. This is a practice that had been especially important to "heritage acts" (which is a record industry euphemism for "old music recorded by Black people"), for whom this right represented the difference between making rent and ending up on the street. When it became clear that Glazier had pulled this musician-impoverishing scam, there was so much public outcry, that Congress actually came back for a special session, just to vote again to cancel Glazier's amendment. And then Glazier was kicked out of his cushy Congressional job, whereupon the RIAA started paying more than $1m/year to "represent the music industry." This is the guy who signed that press release in my inbox. And his message was: The problem isn't that Midjourney wants to train a Gen AI model on copyrighted works, and then use that model to put artists on the breadline. The problem is that Midjourney didn't pay RIAA members Universal and Disney for permission to train a model. Because if only Midjourney had given Disney and Universal several million dollars for training rights to their catalogs, the companies would have happily allowed them to train to their heart's content, and they would have bought the resulting models, and fired as many creative professionals as they could. I mean, have we already forgotten the Hollywood strikes? I sure haven't. I live in Burbank, home to Disney, Universal and Warner, and I was out on the line with my comrades from the Writers Guild, offering solidarity on behalf of my union, IATSE 830, The Animation Guild, where I'm a member of the writers' unit. And I'll never forget when one writer turned to me and said, "You know, you prompt an LLM exactly the same way an exec gives shitty notes to a writers' room. You know: 'Make me ET, except it's about a dog, and put a love interest in there, and a car chase in the second act.' The difference is, you say that to a writers' room and they all make fun of you and call you a fucking idiot suit. But you say it to an LLM and it will cheerfully shit out a terrible script that conforms exactly to that spec (you know, Air Bud)." These companies are desperate to use AI to displace workers. When Getty Images sues AI companies, it's not representing the interests of photographers. Getty hates paying photographers! Getty just wants to get paid for the training run, and they want the resulting AI model to have guardrails, so it will refuse to create images that compete with Getty's images for anyone except Getty. But Getty will absolutely use its models to bankrupt as many photographers as it possibly can. A new copyright to train models won't get us a world where models aren't used to destroy artists, it'll just get us a world where the standard contracts of the handful of companies that control all creative labor markets are updated to require us to hand over those new training rights to those companies. Demanding a new copyright just makes you a useful idiot for your boss, a human shield they can brandish in policy fights, a tissue-thin pretense of "won't someone think of the hungry artists?" When really what they're demanding is a world where 30% of the investment capital of the AI companies go into their shareholders' pockets. When an artist is being devoured by rapacious monopolies, does it matter how they divvy up the meal? We need to protect artists from AI predation, not just create a new way for artists to be mad about their impoverishment. And incredibly enough, there's a really simple way to do that. After 20+ years of being consistently wrong and terrible for artists' rights, the US Copyright Office has finally done something gloriously, wonderfully right. All through this AI bubble, the Copyright Office has maintained – correctly – that AI-generated works cannot be copyrighted, because copyright is exclusively for humans. That's why the "monkey selfie" is in the public domain. Copyright is only awarded to works of human creative expression that are fixed in a tangible medium. And not only has the Copyright Office taken this position, they've defended it vigorously in court, repeatedly winning judgments to uphold this principle. The fact that every AI created work is in the public domain means that if Getty or Disney or Universal or Hearst newspapers use AI to generate works – then anyone else can take those works, copy them, sell them, or give them away for free. And the only thing those companies hate more than paying creative workers, is having other people take their stuff without permission. The US Copyright Office's position means that the only way these companies can get a copyright is to pay humans to do creative work. This is a recipe for centaurhood. If you're a visual artist or writer who uses prompts to come up with ideas or variations, that's no problem, because the ultimate work comes from you. And if you're a video editor who uses deepfakes to change the eyelines of 200 extras in a crowd-scene, then sure, those eyeballs are in the public domain, but the movie stays copyrighted. But creative workers don't have to rely on the US government to rescue us from AI predators. We can do it ourselves, the way the writers did in their historic writers' strike. The writers brought the studios to their knees. They did it because they are organized and solidaristic, but also are allowed to do something that virtually no other workers are allowed to do: they can engage in "sectoral bargaining," whereby all the workers in a sector can negotiate a contract with every employer in the sector. That's been illegal for most workers since the late 1940s, when the Taft-Hartley Act outlawed it. If we are gonna campaign to get a new law passed in hopes of making more money and having more control over our labor, we should campaign to restore sectoral bargaining, not to expand copyright. Our allies in a campaign to expand copyright are our bosses, who have never had our best interests at heart. While our allies in the fight for sector bargaining are every worker in the country. As the song goes, "Which side are you on?" OK, I need to bring this talk in for a landing now, because I'm out of time, so I'm going to close out with this: AI is a bubble and bubbles are terrible. Bubbles transfer the life's savings of normal people who are just trying to have a dignified retirement to the wealthiest and most unethical people in our society, and every bubble eventually bursts, taking their savings with it. But not every bubble is created equal. Some bubbles leave behind something productive. Worldcom stole billions from everyday people by defrauding them about orders for fiber optic cables. The CEO went to prison and died there. But the fiber outlived him. It's still in the ground. At my home, I've got 2gb symmetrical fiber, because AT&T lit up some of that old Worldcom dark fiber. All things being equal, it would have been better if Worldcom hadn't ever existed, but the only thing worse than Worldcom committing all that ghastly fraud would be if there was nothing to salvage from the wreckage. I don't think we'll salvage much from cryptocurrency, for example. Sure, there'll be a few coders who've learned something about secure programming in Rust. But when crypto dies, what it will leave behind is bad Austrian economics and worse monkey JPEGs. AI is a bubble and it will burst. Most of the companies will fail. Most of the data-centers will be shuttered or sold for parts. So what will be left behind? We'll have a bunch of coders who are really good at applied statistics. We'll have a lot of cheap GPUs, which'll be good news for, say, effects artists and climate scientists, who'll be able to buy that critical hardware at pennies on the dollar. And we'll have the open source models that run on commodity hardware, AI tools that can do a lot of useful stuff, like transcribing audio and video, describing images, summarizing documents, automating a lot of labor-intensive graphic editing, like removing backgrounds, or airbrushing passersby out of photos. These will run on our laptops and phones, and open source hackers will find ways to push them to do things their makers never dreamt of. If there had never been an AI bubble, if all this stuff arose merely because computer scientists and product managers noodled around for a few years coming up with cool new apps for back-propagation, machine learning and generative adversarial networks, most people would have been pleasantly surprised with these interesting new things their computers could do. We'd call them "plugins." It's the bubble that sucks, not these applications. The bubble doesn't want cheap useful things. It wants expensive, "disruptive" things: Big foundation models that lose billions of dollars every year. When the AI investment mania halts, most of those models are going to disappear, because it just won't be economical to keep the data-centers running. As Stein's Law has it: "Anything that can't go on forever eventually stops." The collapse of the AI bubble is going to be ugly. Seven AI companies currently account for more than a third of the stock market, and they endlessly pass around the same $100b IOU. Bosses are mass-firing productive workers and replacing them with janky AI, and when the janky AI is gone, no one will be able to find and re-hire most of those workers, we're going to go from disfunctional AI systems to nothing. AI is the asbestos in the walls of our technological society, stuffed there with wild abandon by a finance sector and tech monopolists run amok. We will be excavating it for a generation or more. So we need to get rid of this bubble. Pop it, as quickly as we can. To do that, we have to focus on the material factors driving the bubble. The bubble isn't being driven by deepfake porn, or election disinformation, or AI image-gen, or slop advertising. All that stuff is terrible and harmful, but it's not driving investment. The total dollar figure represented by these apps doesn't come close to making a dent in the capital expenditures and operating costs of AI. They are peripheral, residual uses: flashy, but unimportant to the bubble. Get rid of all those uses and you reduce the expected income of AI companies by a sum so small it rounds to zero. Same goes for all that "AI Safety" nonsense, that purports to concern itself with preventing an AI from attaining sentience and turning us all into paperclips. First of all, this is facially absurd. Throwing more words and GPUs into the word-guessing program won't make it sentient. That's like saying, "Well, we keep breeding these horses to run faster and faster, so it's only a matter of time until one of our mares gives birth to a locomotive." A human mind is not a word-guessing program with a lot of extra words. I'm here for science fiction thought experiments, don't get me wrong. But also, don't mistake sf for prophesy. SF stories about superintelligence are futuristic parables, not business plans, roadmaps, or predictions. The AI Safety people say they are worried that AI is going to end the world, but AI bosses love these weirdos. Because on the one hand, if AI is powerful enough to destroy the world, think of how much money it can make! And on the other hand, no AI business plan has a line on its revenue projections spreadsheet labeled "Income from turning the human race into paperclips." So even if we ban AI companies from doing this, we won't cost them a dime in investment capital. To pop the bubble, we have to hammer on the forces that created the bubble: the myth that AI can do your job, especially if you get high wages that your boss can claw back; the understanding that growth companies need a succession of ever-more-outlandish bubbles to stay alive; the fact that workers and the public they serve are on one side of this fight, and bosses and their investors are on the other side. Because the AI bubble really is very bad news, it's worth fighting seriously, and a serious fight against AI strikes at its roots: the material factors fueling the hundreds of billions in wasted capital that are being spent to put us all on the breadline and fill all our walls with high-tech asbestos.

Title: Millionaire YouTuber Hank Green tells Gen Z to rethink their Tesla bets—and shares the portfolio changes he’s making to avoid AI-bubble fallout
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/07/millionaire-youtuber-hank-green-investing-tips-gen-z-invest-in-market-avoid-ai-bubble-diversification/
Time Published: 2025-12-07T12:05:00Z
Full Content:
For years, YouTube star Hank Green has stuck to the same straightforward investing wisdom touted by legends like Warren Buffett: Put your money in an S&P 500 index fund and leave it alone. It’s advice that has paid off handsomely for millions of investors: This year alone, the index is up roughly some 16% and averaged more than 20% in gains over the past three years and roughly 14.6% over the past two decades. In most cases, it has easily beaten investors who try to pick individual stocks like Tesla or Meta. But as Wall Street frets over a possible AI-driven bubble—with voices from Big Short investor Michael Burry to economist Mohamed El-Erian sounding alarms—Green isn’t waiting around to see what happens. He’s already rethinking how much of his own wealth is tied to Big Tech. A major reason: The S&P 500 is more concentrated than ever. The top 10 companies—including Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta—make up nearly 40% of the entire index. And nearly all of them are pouring billions into AI. “I feel like my money is more exposed than I would like it to be,” Green said in a video that’s racked up over 1.6 million views. “I feel like by virtue of having a lot of my money in the S&P 500, I am now kind of betting on a big AI future. And that’s not a future that I definitely think is going to happen.” So Green is hedging. He’s taking 25% of the money he previously invested in S&P 500 index funds—a meaningful chunk for a self-made millionaire—and moving it into a more diversified set of assets, including: Green’s thesis is simple: Even if AI transforms the economy, the biggest winners may ultimately not be the mega-cap companies building the models. “I think that these giant companies providing the AI models will actually be competing with each other for those customers in part by competing on price,” Green said. “And that might mean that the value delivered to small companies will be bigger than value delivered to the big AI companies. Who knows, though? I just think that’s a thing that could happen.” And if his concerns are overblown? He’s fine with that, too. “If I’m wrong, 75% of my money is still in the safe place that everybody says your money should be, which is the S&P 500.” Gen Z continues to trail other generations in financial know-how—from saving and investing to understanding risk, according to TIAA. Moreover, one in four admit they are not confident in their financial knowledge and skill—a stark admission considering that one in seven Gen Z credit card users have maxed out their credit cards and many young people hold thousands in student loan debt. As a self-described “middle-aged, 45-year-old successful person,” Green said he’s trying to model what thoughtful, long-term decision-making actually looks like. And part of that effort includes dispelling one big misconception shared among some of his audience: “I get these comments from people who are like, I can’t believe that you’re participating in this Ponzi scheme,” Green told Fortune. “I do want to alienate those people, because I don’t believe that the stock market is a Ponzi scheme. I do think that it’s overvalued right now, but I think that it’s tied to real value that’s really created in the world.” His broader point: Investing isn’t about vibes or just dumping money into the hot stock of the week; rather, it’s something to seriously research. “A lot of people think that investing is like getting a Robinhood account and buying Tesla,” Green added. “And I’m like, ‘Nope, you’ve got to get a Fidelity account and buy a low-cost index fund everybody and or just keep it in your 401(k) and let the people who manage it manage it’—which is what a lot of people do, which is also fine.” His younger viewers are paying attention. One popular comment summed it up: “As a young person entering the point in my life where I’m starting to think about investing, I really appreciate you talking through your logic and giving a ton of disclaimers rather than telling me I should buy buy buy exactly what you buy buy buy.” The comment has already racked up more than 4,700 likes. While Green doesn’t come from a financial background, experts from the world of investing said they agree largely with his rationale: Having a diversified portfolio is the way to go—especially if you have worries about an AI bubble. “Unlike many dotcom companies, today’s tech giants generally have substantial revenue, cash reserves, and established business models beyond just AI,” certified financial planner Bo Hanson, host of The Money Guy Show, said in a video analyzing Green’s take. “Still, the concentration risk remains a valid concern for investors that are seeking diversification. However, this is precisely why we advise against putting all investments solely in the S&P 500, especially if you have a shorter time horizon.” Hanson added wise investors spread their money across various asset classes, including small-caps, international, and bonds, in order to reduce portfolio volatility and provide more consistent returns across various market environments. It’s sentiment echoed by Doug Ornstein, director at TIAA Wealth Management, who said it’s important to realize that not every investment needs to chase growth. “Particularly as you get older, having guaranteed income streams becomes crucial. Products like annuities can provide reliable payments regardless of market swings, creating a foundation of financial security,” Ornstein told Fortune. “Think of it as building a floor beneath your portfolio—one that market volatility can’t touch.”

Full Content:
By Rolling Stone If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Rolling Stone may receive an affiliate commission. There are two kinds of people in this world: those who are easy to shop for, and those who make the holiday season a little more challenging with their picky, well, let’s call it specific taste. With hundreds of websites to choose from, and the holidays fast approaching (most shipping deadlines are Dec. 17, 2025, to arrive in time for Christmas), how do you find unique gifts for the nice-list members who are a bit more particular? Our Rolling Stone editors have put together a guide featuring more than 60 of the best gifts to grab this holiday season. While most of these items are music-oriented — that’s what we do, after all — we’ve also included a few surprises that will make anyone feel merry and bright. From Grateful Dead collaborations to band merch that’s a lot more premium than digging through a bargain bin to the best in tech and tested audio equipment, these are our top-rated gifts for this holiday season. So go ahead, read, peek, and add to cart. It’s everything you didn’t know you were looking for, all in one place. From musician autobiographies to coffee-table books featuring your favorite bands, these are the best gifts for every reader. $22.17 $29.99 26% off Lawrence Burney’s debut, No Sense in Wishing: Essays, traces the author and cultural critic’s musical journey from his formative years in Baltimore to transformative experiences in Lagos and Johannesburg. Burney explores turning points like watching his mother perform as the opening act at a Gil Scott-Heron show, Lupe Fiasco introducing him to a kind of Blackness he initially thought was “corny as shit,“ and the New York fandom leading him to interrogate regional distinctions of Blackness. The collection of essays transcends the author’s personal self-searching to become a fresh ethno-musical study. $24.50 $35.00 30% off Cameron Crowe’s semi-autobiographical film, Almost Famous, was inspired by his early days as a teenage Rolling Stone reporter. Now, Crowe returns to that familiar territory, without the gloss of fiction. The Uncool is a memoir documenting a raucous time for rock & roll and a freewheeling moment in this publication’s history, when the merely 16-year-old Crowe profiled artists like Led Zeppelin and Jackson Browne. There’s no shortage of famous faces in The Uncool: David Bowie, Joni Mitchell, and Kris Kristofferson, to name a few. But there are some not-so-famous ones, too; Crowe dives deep on his family, offering a portrait of his parents and his Southern Californian upbringing. $50.37 $65.00 23% off Jill Furmanovsky’s Oasis: Trying to Find a Way Out of Nowhere would have been the ideal tribute to what once was, if not for the unlikeliest of unlikely story lines — the brothers Gallagher reuniting for one of the most unforgettable tours in the history of rock & roll. Oasis: Trying to Find a Way Out of Nowhere features hundreds of photos of the band in the studio, onstage, and everywhere in between. Furmanovsky has photographed Oasis since the Definitely Maybe days, making this one of the most intimate looks at a band that would immodestly — but not incorrectly — call themselves Familiar to Millions. $107.23 $150.00 29% off Anton Corbijn’s music-video credits play like a greatest hits of rock from the 1980s onward. From U2 and Depeche Mode to Nirvana and Metallica, Corbijn has been there, camera in tow. This retrospective compiles hundreds of photographs from Corbijn’s archives, including portraits of R.E.M., the Rolling Stones, and Nick Cave. The book also includes written contributions from Adam Clayton of U2, Marlene Dumas, Johan Faes, Samantha Morton, and Tom Waits. $55.00 From her live performances to her music videos, Mitski has an undeniable power of drawing audiences in. Photographer Ebru Yıldız distills that electric energy into King of All the Land, a 144-page art book featuring powerful black-and-white images of Mitski, shot around Nashville. Yıldız is known largely for her portraits of musicians, from John Cale and David Byrne to Lucy Dacus and Angel Olsen. King of All the Land documents the synergy of two artists — Yıldız and Mitski — and their singular, uncompromising visions. $71.96 $100.00 28% off This photography book from rock & roll photographer Elliott Landy comprises nearly 400 images of the Band during a formative year from 1968 to ’69. The group was creating their first two albums, Music from Big Pink and The Band, which birthed a new Americana sound. “I don’t believe there will ever be anything that even vaguely resembles that kind of musical unity again. Nor does there need to be. They said it all,” writes Eric Clapton, in the book’s foreword. $69.90 $75.00 7% off This definitive behind-the-scenes book delivers the full story of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Journalist and author Jay Glennie worked with Quentin Tarantino to unearth photographs from the set, concept art, production memos, and other artifacts from the film’s creation. The book also includes more than 65 exclusive interviews with cast and crew members, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, and Margot Robbie. It’s a peek at how the double Oscar-winner was created, and Tarantino’s movie-making process. $14.50 Sometimes it’s far more interesting to dive into an autobiography than a fantasy novel — no shade to our beloved fiction favorites. But this one about Eighties pop icon Debbie Gibson is easily one of the most compelling reads to hit our list in years. At 178 pages, it’s a tight, intimate look at Gibson’s life and career. $12.81 $27.99 54% off Rob Sheffield — bestselling author, journalist, and longtime Rolling Stone contributing editor (since 1997, no big deal) — has written eight books on music, TV, and pop culture. His latest, Heartbreak Is the National Anthem, might be his most powerful yet.With an in-depth look into the life and legacy of Taylor Swift, he explores everything from the magical relationship she has with her fans and her songwriting prowess to her ability to captivate stadiums filled with 90,000 people. It’s a “Timeless” masterpiece that you’ll want to read over and over again. $11.99 Music journalist Jeff Weiss spent the first years of his career in Los Angeles working for celebrity tabloids at a time when the medium was at its peak. In the early 2000s, before blogs and social media pushed the industry off its track, Weiss carved out a niche as a young and hungry writer willing to concoct elaborate fake personas in order to chase down the day’s biggest story. Of course, the most prominent pop star of the time, Britney Spears, was always in his crosshairs. This book, which documents his time in the ethically murky industry, not only charts her rise from a bubbly Louisiana teen to her entry into a conservatorship but also wrestles with his own complicity in her downfall. While it’s not entirely nonfiction — Weiss has admitted that some of the scenes were created with literary license, though he’s declined to say exactly which ones — it’s a frenetic and engrossing read, perfect for anyone interested in Spears’ career or tabloid media’s race to the bottom. The most impressive part of the book is the care with which he comes at the subject. “I tried to make it a sympathetic portrayal of Britney,” Weiss told Rolling Stone earlier this year. “I didn’t want to be condescending to her.” $25.06 $29.00 14% off We know you’re not supposed to judge a book by its cover, but trust us, this paperback by Mark Ronson reads just as good as it looks. On sale for the holidays, it’s an authentic and compelling account from the man behind some of today’s most influential tracks. $33.17 $50.00 34% off Photography legend Jim Marshall’s book, The Grateful Dead: Photos and Stories From the Formative Years, 1966-1977, is the first-ever collection dedicated solely to his work with the Grateful Dead. This book features some of the most revealing and previously unseen images of the band, most of which were captured in San Francisco. It also includes notable musicians like Janis Joplin, Neil Young, David Crosby, and others. Additionally, the book includes an afterward by John Mayer, the frontman and guitarist of Dead & Company. It features colored edges, making it a perfect gift for fans of the psychedelic scene of the 1960s and 1970s. Whether they’re a fan from afar or proudly “with the band,” these gifts — from home decor to limited-edition games and instruments — are must-haves for any music devotee. $45.00 Noah Kahan’s beloved album Stick Season may have dropped in 2022, but our staff still has it on repeat (just peek at a few of our Spotify Wrapped receipts). If there’s a Kahan fan in your life, or honestly just someone who lives in New England, grab this Stick Season candle by Ranger Station. It smells like a chilly day in Maine, but without the frostbite. The brand notes it has a long burn time too, of up to 30 hours. $36.98 $75.00 51% off Barbie has released plenty of diva dolls over the years — there was the recent Stevie Nicks launch, the Aaliyah Barbie that sold out in seconds, and now a drop dedicated to the Queen of Christmas herself, Mariah Carey. Decked out in her sparkly red dress, this rare doll is already almost sold out on Amazon. So if you’re waiting for the right “tiiiiiime!” to add it to your cart for the collector in your life, this is it. $21.25 $25.00 15% off Shopping for musicians can be trickier than it seems — most are extremely particular about their gear (understandably so; not every axe is created equal). That’s why we suggest something like this leather guitar-pick holder. It’s way less pressure than choosing a new guitar for them, but just as useful — and it still feels thoughtful. Plus, Etsy notes that you can engrave the case, making them feel like the rock star they already are. $1,210.00 Ah, sometimes we miss the nostalgic days of the boombox era … OK, we’re mostly kidding, because playing music on your phone is definitely more convenient. But that longing for the good-old days pops up now and then. That’s why we love this necklace from editor-favorite brand Sydney Evan. It’s cheeky yet chic and makes a great gift for yourself or the fellow Nineties wild child in your life. $79.96 Good golly, Miss Dolly! The country superstar has done it again: this time with wines that taste far more premium than their affordable price tag. Available on the Home Shopping Network in various multi-packs, these Dolly Parton-branded wines come in adorable packaging with an even punchier taste. They’re the perfect gift for any holiday soiree or secret Santa exchange. $16.30 If you want presents as unique as the person receiving them, Uncommon Goods is our go-to. These music-themed playing cards feature legends like Amy Winehouse, David Bowie, and Prince, making them an ace when it comes to gifting. Grab a deck for as low as $16. $39.99 Surprise your favorite Metallica fan with the very same stainless-steel tumbler used by James Ulrich onstage. He even has a specially designed microphone stand with a bottle holder for his Yeti when he’s performing live. This 20-ounce cup keeps cold drinks cold and hot drinks hot — whether you’re singing onstage or having a casual karaoke sesh by the fire this holiday season. $329.00 $388.00 15% off If you want to win the award for giving your favorite musician the coolest gift they’ve ever received (or seen, for that matter), this sampler is it. For less than $330, it’s “packed with over 400 handcrafted instruments and sounds from iconic reggae producers, plus a synth engine with classic bass and lead tones and pressure-sensitive dub sirens,” according to the brand. $1,149.00 This gorgeous, compact, and incredibly playable instrument will instantly become anyone’s couch guitar of choice, and it’s also set up with the electronics you need to play out. As the brand-new junior model of Jeff Tweedy’s just-reissued signature 00DB — which aimed to emulate Woody Guthrie’s guitars of choice — it’s also shockingly affordable for a Martin signature guitar, with a tight, punchy sound. It’s made of sustainable wood too. Only one warning: If you buy this thing and fail to instantly write “Handshake Drugs”-level masterpieces on it, that’s on you. $50.00 Valhalla digital plugins are the behind-the-scenes secret sauce on everything from pop smashes to single-stream hopefuls. Always affordable, simple to use, and beautifully designed, their newest drop, FutureVerb’s clean spaces pair easily with highly colored echoes, transforming generic ho-hum sounds into towering epic studio ’scapes. $24.95 “Roll dice and leave your bummers behind,” advertises Jerry Garcia’s Cosmic Journey, a new game from Twogether Studios. This game does all that and more, as you roll extremely groovy dice (they’re tie-dye, obviously), and take trips around the iconic frontman’s artwork while accumulating tokens. The packaging also includes a “cosmic journey bag” that you can use for the game pieces or … other items. “My dad’s legacy lives on through moments of joy, laughter, and connection,” Trixie Garcia said in a statement. “Like music, games foster community, and Jerry Garcia’s Cosmic Journey is a whimsical way for fans to keep that spirit alive wherever the road may lead.” Amen to that. $17.98 The Twice trio recorded their own version of Huntr/x’s original diss track “Takedown” for this film’s soundtrack, and the group’s own song “Strategy” is also included in the film and on the album. Even if you’ve just had the Saja Boys’ infectious “Soda Pop” stuck in your head for weeks (we don’t blame you, us too), then you’ll want to order it now before it sells out ahead of the holidays. The CD comes with a fold-out poster and photo card (random one of three), like a real K-pop album. What better way to celebrate the White Stripes’ recent induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame than with this stunner? The Complete Studio Albums marks the first time the band’s six records have been compiled together, from their 1999 self-titled debut all the way to their final masterpiece, 2007’s Icky Thump. The box set’s slipcase features previously unseen images of your favorite duo in their home of Detroit: On the front, Jack and Meg are seen on the Ambassador Bridge, which overlooks the Detroit River, while on the back, they’re standing outside Duly’s Place Coney Island. Plus, this is a Third Man Records release, so you just know it’s going to be pressed on colorful wax, and they really deliver here, with each album sporting a red-and-white “coin-flip” look. The Complete Studio Albums is a limited edition. Or, as Third Man’s co-founder and White Stripes’ archivist Ben Blackwell said, “You’re not going to just find these at any old bodega on the street!” While this specific product is sold out (we hope it comes back soon), you can shop more White Stripes vinyl and box sets here. $215.00 Shopping for a Wilco fan? All you need is this box set and tickets to one of their upcoming shows, and you can check them off your list twice in one go. $99.00 Backpack-sized and ready to fit into every producer’s setup, this is going to become a must, especially for laptop warriors. With real people-size controls, a screen so you can see what all the many, many knobs are actually doing, and a way to hit stop when your jam gets out of control, Akai’s new midi controller finally gets this small form factor right. $349.99 A turntable is always a great gift — whether they live and breathe vinyl or just want to give their living space a retro upgrade. $26.14 $32.99 21% off Bummed the five-foot-tall superstar’s Short n’ Sweet tour is over? Continue the sleepover party with these two dazzling records: The recent Grammy-nominated Man’s Best Friend and her 2023 Christmas EP, Fruitcake. The former is available in several spectacular vinyl variants, from iridescent blue to light brown, as well as several alternate covers that are worth getting your hands on. Fruitcake, one of the strongest Christmas albums from a pop star in years, is jam-packed (no pun intended) with Carpenter’s signature melodies and innuendos, only holiday themed (“I need that Charles Dickens,” she sings on “A Nonsense Christmas”). The milky, clear, and liquid glitter vinyl sold out instantly, but plenty of other colors are available. Put that on with Carpenter’s 2024 Christmas special in the background, and you’ll have a ho-ho holiday. $23.99 A gift that transcends generations, this limited-edition Buckingham Nicks baby-blue vinyl is a present worth fighting over. Perfect for your cousin who just discovered Fleetwood Mac on TikTok — or your grandmother who hasn’t stopped playing it since the Seventies. It’s a Yankee Swap winner. $20.99 Wondering what to do with your stack of cassettes after your 2006 Honda finally bit the dust? For those of us still committed to portable physical media — without the CD skips — Amazon has a perfect solution. This portable cassette player lets you revisit your collection using your favorite wired or wireless headphones. The best part is its ability to record, too, meaning endless possibilities to impress that special someone with a good old-fashioned mix tape. $39.99 For the aspiring studio rat in your life, give them a break and get them what they won’t get themselves. A way to figure out what’s wrong when there’s no sound happening. This affordable Swiss army knife of a cable tester will help them figure out that they need to take better care of their connections. From the best Bluetooth speakers to over-ear cans that block out the world, these tech-forward gifts are everything they’ve been wanting this season. $129.00 $149.00 13% off With a stylish transparent case and plenty of smart features, Nothing’s earbuds are a standout, and the sound quality outperforms a lot of the competition at this price. Replace your giftee’s old, tired buds this season with a fresh new pair (for 13 percent off). $179.99 From its long-lasting battery life (30-plus hours on a charge) to its packable frame, the Marshall Emberton speaker checks all of our boxes for a great, reliable outdoor speaker. We’ve used ours to play music outside for months (and left it there, accidentally), because that’s what it’s designed to do. It can handle rain, serious dust, and hours of tunes. Bonus: The retro design instantly makes any patio look cooler. $59.95 Over the past couple of years, Loop has established itself as the leader in universal-fit earplugs. Most of our staff (myself included) have extensively tested the brand’s bestsellers and can confidently say the hype is real. I love their metallic, jewelry-like design, which makes them better-looking than most earplugs (unless you want total discretion). More importantly, I love the excellent noise-reduction that turns down the volume without sacrificing audio quality.The Loop Switch 2 is our top pick from the brand. Unlike most earplugs, you can adjust how much volume is let in by shifting a dial (no need to swap tips). The plugs have three modes: “Quiet,” “Experience,” and “Engage,” ranging from almost full quiet to noise-dampening. The former is great for non-concert activities, as well as extremely loud shows, while the “Engage” option is ideal for full immersion and occasional conversations. $499.99 $599.99 17% off Polaroid’s flagship camera will take your instant photos to the next level. With tack-sharp autofocus and fully-manual controls built into the camera (and even more available via an App), you can take full command behind the lens. The I-2 lens contains the largest aperture of any Polaroid camera to date, allowing for beautiful portraits and lower-light shooting that was never possible before. $649.00 $849.95 24% off The X Half combines analog ideas in a digital format. At its simplest, the camera is fun-sized, vertically-oriented, and loaded up with Fuji’s signature-film presets based on the brand’s own classic film stocks. To really turn up the old-school experience, there is a “film camera mode” that prevents image previews, which requires the user to use a film advance lever to enable the next frame. In standard mode, that same lever can also be used to enable split-frame photography, much like the original half-frame cameras that it is based on. $449.99 $549.00 18% off I first tried these headphones last summer, when a manager played me a song on them. I was stunned by the sound quality and immediately asked what brand they were. There’s a lot to love with the AirPods Max: The sound is expansive and truly noise-cancelling; they instantly connect to all of my devices; and they have a long battery life. Plus, they’re available in flattering colors and actually fit my tiny head, unlike previous headphones. They sit snug and comfortably in place, whether I’m sitting at my desk, walking around New York City, or even running on the treadmill. It’s a steep price, but totally worth it when I think about how much use I’m getting out of them and how perfect a gift they’d make. $699.99 You know a gift is truly great when it’s sold out almost everywhere — who doesn’t remember the Cabbage Patch craze of the Eighties? Luckily, we tracked down the Marshall Heston 60 soundbar, still available at Best Buy in limited quantities. While it comes with a $699 price tag, it’ll amp up movie night for any cinephile in your life. $89.00 $99.00 10% off Finding a great gift can already feel like a win, but scoring one on sale makes the season even merrier and brighter. Take this wireless audio streamer, for instance: Available on Amazon with delivery in less than two days via Prime, it’s a fun little gadget that fits neatly on a desk or bedside table. $1,199.99 $1,499.99 20% off Our staff tested dozens of speakers this year, and Klipsch’s the Sevens were the best in terms of sound, price, and design. The midcentury-inspired bookshelf speakers deliver a beautiful sound stage and a warm, full experience — no matter what kind of music you’re playing. They don’t require an amp, making them a great gift for audiophiles and newbies alike. $399.99 $449.00 11% off Bose’s latest QuietComfort Ultra headphones, released in October, combine the all-day comfort and industry-leading noise canceling Bose is known for with subtle, but genuinely useful upgrades over the original 2023 model. The latest generation of the headphones features a similar design to the first generation, but with polished metal yokes instead of matte. While I personally preferred the understated matte accents, the QC Ultra 2 headphones nonetheless have a stylish, high-end look. They’re lightweight, but the headband and ear cups have ample, comfortable cushioning. Overall, when it comes to performance and features, noise-canceling and audio quality, and comfort and design, the QC Ultra 2 headphones are as close to the complete package as anything on the market. While we love digging through concert merch bins and scouring our favorite thrift shops for the coolest band gear, these clothing picks are just as awesome — with half the effort. $68.00 Imogene + Willie offers some of the softest 100-percent cotton graphic tees, as well as adorable caps and beanies. Originally a denim company, Imogene + Willie has evolved into a full retail shop with brick-and-mortar locations in Austin and Nashville. Their designs are heavily influenced by music, and they collaborate with artists like Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, and Billy Strings, as well as iconic venues like the Grand Ole Opry. Their clothing is both stylish and cozy, creating a perfect concert outfit. We test a lot of clothing at Rolling Stone, but there’s one brand we keep coming back to: Dr. Martens. The iconic footwear company just dropped these new stud-covered shoes, and we’re already chomping at the bit to wear them to our next rock concert. Sure, they’d make an epic gift for anyone on your nice list, but honestly? They’re the kind of steal you should snap up for yourself while they’re still in stock. $250.00+ There’s no shortage of merch for Deadheads, from dog bowls to toothbrush holders. And don’t even get us started on apparel. The Dead have done collaborations with everyone from Old Navy to designer Gabriela Hearst. So, where does one get the best Steal Your Face sweater? Look no further than Alice + Olivia, who just released their new collab with the Dead (their second since 2016) in honor of the iconic band’s 60th anniversary. It’s difficult not to be overwhelmed by the amount of stellar items they have, but I recommend the skull pullover and muscle tank, which are great quality and fit perfectly. However, any of the items make a great gift for the Deadhead in your life — they’re sure to be merry and grateful. $125.00 You know what they say: The best time to wear a striped sweater is all the time — especially when it’s covered in embroidered emblems. Available in sizes from small to 2XL, there are “No Surprises” with this Radiohead jumper: It’s high-quality, has a premium design, and will make your giftee look like the opposite of a “Creep.” $17.40 Socks can be a controversial gift, does Dad really need another pair of crisp, white calf coverings? But this black-and-white pair, made in collaboration with American band Blue Angel, is a massive upgrade from the basic gift. $110.00 Sometimes it’s worth taking style tips from some of our favorite celebrities, like Matthew McConaughey and Brooke Shields, and this time, they were definitely right about Caddis glasses. The eyewear brand, which has been crafting some of Hollywood’s favorite reading and prescription frames since 2017, is a viral sensation — and one that actually lives up to the hype. With multiple styles to choose from, Caddis glasses keep anyone on trend, whether it’s just for fun (sunglasses) or for necessity (progressive readers). $110.00+ The perfect gift for any jam-band fan is a vintage T-shirt from Jesse Lockwood’s Primarily Dead shop. While the shop (which has been operating since 2020) features primarily Dead items (as its name suggests), it also offers T-shirts, stickers, and more from bands like Phish, the Allman Brothers, Pink Floyd, and other classic-rock and jam bands. Lockwood is very selective about what he sells, offering an array of choices, telling Rolling Stone, “Every one of these shirts has a story to tell — some were made and sold by fans in small batches in parking lots just to generate enough money to get to the next show, some are licensed single-show shirts made by the band and only sold at that venue, and others were more widely available. They all create a nostalgic feeling for both the people that were there and the people that wish they could have been there.” Lockwood also sources shirts. If you are looking for something specific, contact him on Instagram @primarily_dead or through his website, https://www.primarilydead.com/. $76.00 They don’t have to be a star on the court to love this Tennis Brat crew-neck sweater. This social media sensation works for every It-girl (or It-boy) on your shopping list thanks to the brand’s premium fabrics, easy fit, and unmistakable logo. $224.25 $299.00 25% off It’s no secret that the little black bricks in our pockets can be a major attention hog, but paradoxically, there are some situations where integrating tech in more places makes it less obtrusive. Take Meta’s Ray-Ban glasses, which let you record photos, video, and more, all while keeping your phone securely stashed. First released in 2023, Meta’s Ray-Ban AI glasses have outlasted other smart glasses for one simple, undeniable reason — they don’t look ridiculous. Instead, Meta smartly leveraged the recognizable style of the world’s most iconic eyewear brand, landing on a design that’s barely more conspicuous than regular Wayfarers. If you want an all-encompassing gift — from gaming gear to experiential presents — these finds are perfect for a variety of ages and interests. $59.99 If there’s just one game you need to play from 2025, it’s Sandfall Interactive’s Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. The French RPG draws inspiration from Japanese titans of the genre like Final Fantasy, with a dynamic combat system that blends turn-based strategy and rhythmic parrying. And while the action is engaging, it’s the heartbreaking narrative and world-building that’s made the year’s most talked-about game a sensation. Set in a fantasy realm where a divine entity known as the Paintress eradicates everyone over a certain age year after year, players take on the roles of the latest band of would-be saviors on a suicide mission to bring humanity back from the brink. With award-worthy voice work from actors like Charlie Cox, Jennifer Hale, and Andy Serkis, the story presented in-game is a genuine tearjerker, and should be experienced by the widest possible audience, even if RPGs aren’t normally your bag. $498.88 A new generation of Nintendo hardware is always an event, but there’s some special alchemy that’s put Switch 2 on another level. The hybrid handheld/home console has quickly become the fastest selling console of all time, largely in part because of its, frankly, insane lineup of new games and the ability to play legacy Switch titles.The console’s library includes all-new releases like Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, Kirby Air Riders, and Metroid Prime 4 — many of which are among the best games of the year — on top of upgraded versions of classics like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. With great ports of high-end games like Cyberpunk 2077 and indies like Hades II, Switch 2 is one of the most diverse platforms available, with something for every kind of player. $399.99 A good pair of gaming headphones is essential these days, as cinematic experiences and high-stakes online competition demand the best possible soundscape. And while it’s one thing to hear well, Razer Kraken V4 Pro cans provide a visceral physical response to in-game action with HD haptics. What does that mean? It’s essentially the tactile feedback (a.k.a. vibrations) that are now standard in all game controllers but applied to the headset.On PC, Kraken V4 Pro headphones can be paired with other Razer devices via Synapse to create a unique user profile — with certain titles like Borderlands 4 having been custom-tuned to provide haptic feedback and THX spatial audio tailored to the game. But using the OLED control hub, it can connect to basically anything (Switch, PS5, even mobile devices) via BlueTooth, USB, or auxiliary cable. It’s like having a rumbling IMAX theater wrapped around your head. $25.00+ Some people prefer to gift experiences rather than tangible items, and we’re 100 percent on board. A StubHub gift card lets them choose an event near them — whether it’s a concert, comedy show, or dance performance. There’s something for every type of fan. $6.00+ MasterClass is one of the internet’s favorite ways to learn a new skill, with courses on everything from music to acting to cooking. The best part? Every course is taught by an expert in the field, and many are also A-list celebrities. Gift it this holiday season for as low as $6. $65.00 Longtime cannabis activist Jane West got her start making accessories way back in 2016, right around the time weed was legalized in her home state of Colorado. She’d been working to promote women within the male-dominated industry, and her product line was similarly focused. We’ve been fans for the past decade, partaking in her ever-growing line of pipes, one-hitters, bongs, and bubblers, sometimes disguised as makeup compacts for discreet use. But her newest endeavor, the Twenties Collection, is by far our favorite. Inspired by Art Deco designs, these cut-glass objects are as beautiful as they are functional, and this hand pipe has become our favorite smoking object in our extensive arsenal. $90.00 There’s an unspoken competition about who looks best on the slopes, and these Grateful Dead and Knockaround snow goggles will help your favorite snowboarder or skier claim the title. Grab them at Dick’s Sporting Goods for under $100. $199.25 Building Lego’s 1,074-piece Fender Stratocaster set feels almost as gratifying as performing a solo on the guitar used by legends from Jimi Hendrix to Kurt Cobain. Everything here feels true to life, albeit miniaturized, including the Lego brick-based guitar’s pickup switch, tuning pegs, textile strap, stand, and picks (you have a choice of four colors). The best part? The fact that the set comes with an opportunity to view the final piece’s interior details, like its motherboard, not to mention that you can create the guitar in either black or red. Ideal for both rock & roll aficionados and the Lego-obsessed, this is a holiday gift that will keep on giving. After all, your recipient can rebuild it an endless amount of times (and our editors recommend doing just that). $9.99 We may be biased, but a Rolling Stone subscription is about as good as it gets. Sign them up online now for $9.99 for print and digital access — the best value for any music lover.

Home Videos Podcasts Articles GPU Chart Merchandise Support Us! More... Written by Tom of Moore’s Law Is Dead Special Assistance by KarbinCry & kari-no-sugata Based on this Video: https://youtu.be/BORRBce5TGw At the beginning of November, I ordered a 32GB DDR5 kit for pairing with a Minisforum BD790i X3D motherboard, and three weeks later those very same sticks of DDR5 are now listed for a staggering $330– a 156% increase in price from less than a month ago! At this rate, it seems likely that by Christmas, that DDR5 kit alone could be worth more than the entire Zen 4 X3D platform I planned to pair it with! How could this happen, and more specifically – how could this happen THIS quickly? Well, buckle up! I am about to tell you the story of Sam Altman’s Dirty DRAM Deal, or: How the AI bubble, panic, and unpreparedness stole Christmas... But before I dive in, let me make it clear that my RAM kit’s 156% jump in price isn’t a fluke or some extreme example of what's going on right now. Nope, and in fact, I'd like to provide two more examples of how how impossible it is becoming to get ahold of RAM - these were provided by a couple of our sources within the industry: One source that works at a US Retailer, stated that a RAM Manufacturer called them in order to inquire if they might buy RAM from them to stock up for their other customers. This would be like Corsair asking a Best Buy if they had any RAM around. Another source that works at a Prebuilt PC company, was recently given an estimate for when they would receive RAM orders if they placed them now…and they were told December…of 2026! So what happened? Well, it all comes down to three perfectly synergistic events: OpenAI executed two unprecedented RAM deals that took everyone by surprise. The secrecy and size of the deals triggered full-scale panic buying from everyone else. The market had almost zero safety stock left due to tariffs, worry about decreasing RAM prices over the summer, and stalled equipment transfers. Below, we’re going to walk through each of these factors — and then I’m going to warn you about which hardware categories will be hit the hardest, which products are already being cancelled, and what you should buy right now before the shelves turn into a repeat of 2021–2022...because this is doomed to turn into much more than just RAM scarcity... On October 1st OpenAI signed two simultaneous deals with Samsung and SK Hynix for 40% of the worlds DRAM supply. Now, did OpenAI’s competition suspect some big RAM deals could be signed in late 2025? Yes. Ok, but did they think it would be deals this huge and with multiple companies? NO! In fact, if you go back and read reporting on Sam Altman’s now infamous trip to South Korea on October 1st, even just mere hours before the massive deals with Samsung and SK Hynix were simultaneously signed – most reporting simply mentioned vague reports about Sam talking to Samsung, SK Hynix, TSMC, and Foxconn. But the reporting at the time was soft, almost dismissive — “exploring ties,” “seeking cooperation,” “probing for partnerships.” Nobody hinted that OpenAI was about to swallow up to 40% of global DRAM output – even on morning before it happened! Nobody saw this coming - this is clear in the lack of reporting about the deals before they were announced, and every MLID Source who works in DRAM manufacturing and distribution insist this took everyone in the industry by surprise. To be clear - the shock wasn’t that OpenAI made a big deal, no, it was that they made two massive deals this big, at the same time, with Samsung and SK Hynix simultaneously! In fact, according to our sources - both companies had no idea how big each other's deal was, nor how close to simultaneous they were. And this secrecy mattered. It mattered a lot. Had Samsung known SK Hynix was about to commit a similar chunk of supply — or vice-versa — the pricing and terms would have likely been different. It’s entirely conceivable they wouldn’t have both agreed to supply such a substantial part of global supply if they had known more...but at the end of the day - OpenAI did succeed in keeping the circles tight, locking down the NDAs, and leveraging the fact that these companies assumed the other wasn’t giving up this much wafer volume simultaneously…in order to make a surgical strike on the global RAM supply chain…and it's worked so far... Imagine you're running a hyper scaler, or maybe you’re a major OEM, or perhaps pretend that you are simply one of OpenAI’s chief competitors: On October 1st of 2025, you would have woken up to the news that OpenAI had just cornered the memory market more aggressively than any company in the last decade, and you hadn't heard even a murmur that this was coming beforehand! Well, you would probably make some follow-up calls to colleagues in the industry, and then also quickly hear rumors that it wasn't just you - also the two largest suppliers didn’t even see each other’s simultaneous cooperation with OpenAI coming either! You wouldn't go: “Well, that’s an interesting coincidence”, no, you would say: “WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON THAT WE DON’T KNOW ABOUT?” Again – it’s not the size of the deals that's solely the issue here, no, it’s also the unexpectedness and brazenness of them. On October 1st silicon valley executives and procurement managers panicked over concerns like these: What other deals don’t we know about? Is this just the first of many? None of our DRAM suppliers warned us ahead of time! We have to assume they also won't in the future, and that it’s possible all of global DRAM could be bought up without us getting a single warning! We know OpenAI’s competitors are already panic-buying! If we don’t move now, we might be locked out of the market until 2028! OpenAI’s competitors, OEMs, and cloud providers scrambled to secure whatever inventory remained out of self-defense, and self-defense in a world that was entirely defenseless due to the accelerant I’ll now explain in Part III... Normally, the DRAM market has buffers: warehouses of emergency stock, excess wafer starts, older DRAM manufacturing machinery being sold off to budget brands while the big brands upgrade their production lines…but not in 2025, in 2025 those would-be buffers were depleted for three separate reasons: Tariff Chaos. Companies had deliberately reduced how much DRAM they ordered for their safety stock over the summer of 2025 because tariffs were changing almost weekly. Every RAM purchase risked being made at the wrong moment – and so fewer purchases were made. Prices had been falling all summer. Because of the hesitancy to purchase as much safety stock as usual, RAM prices were also genuinely falling over time. And, obviously when memory is getting cheaper month over month, the last thing you’d feel is pressured to buy a commodity that could be cheaper the next month…so everyone waited. Secondary RAM Manufacturing Had Stalled. Budget brands normally buy older DRAM fabrication equipment from mega-producers like Samsung when Samsung upgrades their DRAM lines to the latest and greatest equipment. This allows the DRAM market to expand more than it would otherwise because it makes any upgrading of the fanciest production lines to still be additive change to the market. However, Korean memory firms have been terrified that reselling old equipment to China-adjacent OEMs might trigger U.S. retaliation…and so those machines have been sitting idle in warehouses since early spring. Yep, there was no cushion. OpenAI hit the market at the exact moment it was least prepared. And now time for the biggest twist of all, a twist that’s actually public information, and therefore should be getting discussed by far more people in this writer's opinion: OpenAI isn’t even bothering to buy finished memory modules! No, their deals are unprecedentedly only for raw wafers — uncut, unfinished, and not even allocated to a specific DRAM standard yet. It’s not even clear if they have decided yet on how or when they will finish them into RAM sticks or HBM! Right now it seems like these wafers will just be stockpiled in warehouses – like a kid who hides the toybox because they’re afraid nobody wants to play with them, and thus selfishly feels nobody but them should get the toys! And let’s just say it: Here is the uncomfortable truth Sam Altman is always loath to admit in interviews: OpenAI is worried about losing its lead. The last 18 months have seen competitors catching up fast — Anthropic, Meta, xAI, and specifically Google’s Gemini 3 has gotten a ton of praise just in the past week. Everyone’s chasing training capacity. Everyone needs memory. DRAM is the lifeblood of scaling inference and training throughput. Cutting supply to your rivals is not a conspiracy theory. It’s a business tactic as old as business itself. And so, when you consider how secretive OpenAI was about their deals with Samsung and SK Hynix, but additionally how unready they were to immediately utilize their warehouses of DRAM wafers – it sure seems like a primary goal of these deals was to deprive the market, and not just an attempt to protect OpenAI's own supply… Alright, now that we are done explaining the how, let’s get to the “now what?” – because even if the RAM shortage miraculously improves immediately behind the scenes – even if the AI Bubble instantly popped or 10 companies started tooling up for more DRAM capacity this second (and many are, to be fair), at a minimum the next six to nine months are already screwed. See above: DRAM manufactures are quoting 13-Month lead times for DDR5! This is not a temporary blip. This could be a once-in-a-generation shock. So what gets hit first? What gets hit hardest? Well, below is an E through S-Tier ranking of which products are "the most screwed": S-Tier (Already Screwed – Too Late to Buy) - RAM itself, obviously. RAM prices have “exploded”. The detonation is in the past. A-Tier (Almost Screwed – Don’t Wait to Buy!!!) SSDs. These tends to follow DRAM pricing with a lag. Small Prebuilt PC Companies. That lack large buffers of inventory. RADEON GPUs. AMD doesn’t bundle RAM in their BOM kits to AIBs the way Nvidia does. In fact, the RX 9070 GRE 16GB this channel leaked months ago is almost certainly cancelled according to our sources. XBOX. Microsoft didn’t plan. Prices may rise and/or supply may dwindle in 2026. B-Tier (Eventually Screwed – Don’t wait much longer to buy!) Nvidia GPUs. Nvidia maintains large memory inventories for its board partners, giving them a buffer. But high-capacity GPUs (like a hypothetical 24GB 5080 SUPER) are on ice for now because those stores were never sufficiently built up. In fact, Nvidia is quietly telling partners that their SUPER refresh “might” launch Q3 2026 – although most partners think it’s just a placeholder for when Nvidia expects new capacity to come online, and thus SUPER may never launch. C-Tier (Think about buying soon) Laptops and phones. These companies negotiate immense long-term contracts, so they’re not hit immediately. But once their stockpiles run dry, watch out! D-Tier (Consider buying soon, but there’s no rush) PlayStation. Sony planned better than almost anyone else. They bought aggressively during the summer price trough, which is why they can afford a Black Friday discount while everyone else is raising prices. E-Tier (Prices might actually drop) Anything without RAM. Specifically CPUs that do not come with coolers could see price drops over time since there could be a drop in demand for CPUs if nobody has the RAM to feed them in systems. ???-Tier —Steam Machine. Valve keeps things quiet, but the big unknown is whether they pre-bought RAM months ago before announcing their much-hyped Steam Machine. If they did already stockpile an ample supply of DDR5 - then Steam Machine should launch fine, but supply could dry up temporarily at some point while they wait for prices to drop. However, if they didn’t plan ahead - expect a high launch price and very little resupply…it might even need to be cancelled or there might need to be a variant offered without RAM included (BYO RAM Edition!). And that’s it! This last bit was the most important part of the article in this writer's opinion – an attempt at helping you avoid getting burned. Well, actually, there is one other important reason for this article’s existence I'll tack onto the end – a hope that other people start digging into what’s going on at OpenAI. I mean seriously – do we even have a single reliable audit of their financials to back up them outrageously spending this much money…for this?
