Visa (V) shares fell Tuesday as the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) sued the payment processing giant over allegedly monopolistic behavior to protect its dominant position in the debit card market. "Visa has been the largest, most powerful debit network for over a decade," the DOJ wrote in the lawsuit, which was filed in Manhattan federal court. It alleged that the company's contracts with merchants "unlawfully inhibit competition and stifle innovation." An antitrust lawsuit led Visa and competing payment processor Plaid to abandon merger talks in January 2021. The DOJ said at the time that the planned $5.3 billion merger was an example of Visa's monopolistic behavior, as it looked to acquire a potential rival before it was large enough to effectively challenge it. "We are proud of the payments network we have built, the innovation we advance, and the economic opportunity we enable," said Visa General Counsel Julie Rottenberg in an email. "This lawsuit is meritless, and we will defend ourselves vigorously.” Bloomberg and The New York Times earlier reported a DOJ filing was imminent, causing Visa stock to trade lower throughout the session Tuesday. The shares closed down more than 5%. The lawsuit is the latest move from the DOJ and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in recent years to use antitrust laws to block mergers and challenge dominant companies like Ticketmaster parent Live Nation (LYV), Meta Platforms (META), Apple (AAPL), and Alphabet's Google (GOOGL). Visa shares fell more than 5% to $273.76 soon before the closing bell Tuesday. They are up 5% this year. UPDATE: This story has been updated to note the filing of the lawsuit, add a statement from Visa, and update the share price.

LOS ANGELES - BlackLine, Inc. (NASDAQ:BL), a provider of financial automation software solutions, announced Monday the appointment of David Henshall to its Board of Directors. Henshall's extensive background in enterprise software and financial management is expected to strengthen the company's strategic direction and governance. Henshall has a notable history in executive roles at Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS), where he spent nearly two decades, including time as President and CEO. His tenure at Citrix was marked by a significant push towards cloud computing, which positively impacted the company's operational performance. Before his time at Citrix, he held executive positions, including Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, contributing to his deep understanding of financial operations in the technology sector. BlackLine's leadership expressed strong support for Henshall's appointment. Co-CEO and Chairman Owen Ryan highlighted Henshall's unique executive experience and alignment with BlackLine's vision and operating model. Co-CEO and Founder Therese Tucker anticipates that Henshall's insights will bolster the company's strategic initiatives and help deliver value to customers and investors. In response to his appointment, Henshall expressed honor in joining BlackLine's Board and commended the company's market position and platform capabilities that serve the office of the CFO. He looks forward to contributing to BlackLine's ongoing growth and success. David Henshall's board experience extends beyond BlackLine, with active roles on the boards of HashiCorp (NASDAQ:HCP), Inc., Aspen Technology (NASDAQ:AZPN), Inc., and Feedzai, Inc. His past board chairmanship at Everbridge (NASDAQ:EVBG), Inc., and directorship roles at New Relic (NYSE:NEWR), Inc., and LogMeIn (NASDAQ:LOGM), Inc., reflect his extensive governance experience. BlackLine's platform aims to transform digital finance by providing organizations with accurate, efficient, and intelligent financial operations, a mission that Henshall's expertise is set to enhance. The company's commitment to innovation, security practices, and customer partnership is underscored by its global customer base of over 4,400 enterprises. This move comes as part of BlackLine's strategy to continuously evolve its governance and operational strategies, with an eye on long-term growth. The information in this article is based on a press release statement from BlackLine, Inc. In other recent news, BlackLine, Inc. reported a significant growth in its Q2 2024 earnings with a revenue of $161 million and a non-GAAP net income of $43 million. The company's strategic product portfolio, particularly in consolidation and financial analytics, had a strong quarter. On the other hand, Soros Capital Management made a notable move by completely selling off its stakes in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). The Saudi Public Investment Fund showed a bullish stance by adding call positions in PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Microsoft, and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), increasing the value of its U.S. stock holdings to roughly $20.7 billion. Jana Partners also established a new position in BlackLine Systems, owning nearly a 2% stake in the company. In more recent developments, BlackLine expects a total GAAP revenue for Q3 to be between $162 million and $164 million, indicating an 8% to 9% growth. Meanwhile, Soros Capital Management reduced its investments in major tech firms like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, and Meta Platforms. These are the recent highlights from the world of investments and finance. BlackLine, Inc. (NASDAQ:BL) shows a promising outlook with a market capitalization of $3.19 billion, reflecting its significance in the financial automation software solutions sector. This valuation is supported by a robust gross profit margin of 75.39% over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, indicating the company's efficiency in managing its cost of goods sold relative to its sales. Investors looking at the company's earnings potential will find that BlackLine is trading at a high Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio of 26.19, which has adjusted to a higher forward P/E ratio of 46.21 for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024. This suggests that investors are expecting higher future earnings, which aligns with one of the InvestingPro Tips indicating that net income is expected to grow this year. Moreover, BlackLine's revenue growth remains positive, with an 11.94% increase over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, demonstrating the company's capacity to expand its sales. InvestingPro Tips also highlight that the company operates with a moderate level of debt, which can be an important factor for investors considering the financial stability of BlackLine. For those interested in further analysis, InvestingPro offers additional tips on BlackLine, which can be found at InvestingPro.

Title: Oppenheimer analysts initiate coverage of Pinterest with "Outperform" rating
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/oppenheimer-analysts-initiate-coverage-of-pinterest-with-outperform-rating-3629814

Investing.com -- Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) has the smallest daily active user base among social media companies, but there is "upside" to the company stemming from engagement and advertising on the platform, according to analysts at Oppenheimer. In a note to clients on Tuesday, the analysts noted that Pinterest, which is known for its pinboards designed to spark ideas on everything from recipes to weddings, has the fastest-growing digital advertising offering outside of Instagram-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). "Pinterest operates a global discovery platform with high-intent users in search of products and inspiration, lending itself well to direct response advertising. Relevant ads improve the core user experience, like magazines, driving strong advertiser [return on investment]," the Oppenheimer analysts wrote. They initiated their coverage of the firm with an "Outperform" rating and a share price target of $45. "Ads drive increased engagement, which brings more advertisers, better data, more users, and higher ad pricing. More than half of users think of Pinterest as a place to shop, and 96% of searches are unbranded (e.g., “red dress”) further indicating access to unique inventory," the Oppenheimer analysts said. In July, Pinterest's stock price tumbled by around 15% after the company's third-quarter revenue guidance missed Wall Street expectations. The business said it now expects to post sales of $885 million to $900 million during the period, below estimates of roughly $907 million. However, Pinterest said it had 522 million global monthly active users in the second quarter, above analysts' forecasts, while quarterly average revenue per person of $1.64 met estimates. Speaking in a post-earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Julia Donnelly noted that Pinterest's "more sophisticated advertisers continue to lean into the platform," although she flagged "broader headwinds" are weighing on ad spending by food and beverage groups. In general, however, Pinterest executives said the market for advertising was "relatively stable" in the second quarter.

Title: Meta might soon cut the Meta Quest 3 price and discontinue the 128GB model
URL: https://www.techradar.com/computing/virtual-reality-augmented-reality/meta-might-discontinue-the-meta-quest-3-128gb-headset-and-i-don-t-know-how-to-feel-about-it

The Meta Quest 3S could shake things up more than we thought When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. As I’m writing this, Meta Connect 2024 is just a day away, which means we’re also just a day away from (hopefully) finally seeing the Meta Quest 3S in action – Connect is where many expect the much-leaked headset will make its debut. But its arrival could also be the end of one of the two Meta Quest 3 models, because leaks suggest the 128GB Quest 3 could be discontinued after the 3S launch. This comes from two sources, @CezaryXR – Editor-In-Chief at XRDailyNews – and @Lunayian – the source of most Quest 3S leaks, just ahead of Meta itself. CezaryXR claims that the Quest 3S will have two models: a 128GB variant at around $300 and a 256GB model at around $400; this matches the price in that supposed leaked Amazon ad, and aligns roughly with the Quest 2’s prices of $299 / £299 / AU$479 and $399 / £399 / AU$599 for its two models respectively. What’s more, Meta will also reportedly stop production of the 128GB Quest 3 by mid-November – so when it sells out it won’t come back. Both current Quest 3 models (128GB and 512GB) will be discounted too. Exclusive Leak before Meta Connect:Meta will stop production of the 128GB Quest 3 by mid-November, leaving only the 512GB variant.Both versions will be discounted until the 128GB stock runs out, after which only the 512GB model will be available.September 23, 2024 Lunayian shared the post adding they “heard similar whispers” – however neither source can confirm what prices the Meta Quest 3 headsets will fall to. In either case, it’s worth remembering to take these leaks with a pinch of salt, however they do support my one big piece of advice for anyone keen to buy a VR headset right now: wait. While I think a Quest 3 price drop makes sense (more on that below) whether it happens or not the Quest 3S looks set to be a headset at least worth considering – something you can’t do until it’s official. One question I’ve had about the Quest 3S is how its value proposition will stack up against the regular Quest 3. Yes the rumors say it’ll be bulkier, and have slightly worse specs in areas like its display and RAM – but still boast an identical processor – though as long as these downgrades don’t affect its performance too massively, the main deciding factor will be price. And here there’s a lot of room for error. Make the Quest 3S too pricey and the Quest 3 will remain a no-brainer upgrade killing the new model, make it too cheap and the regular Quest 3’s sales could tank – yes older models get replaced eventually, but VR headsets are not yet at the yearly refresh cycle of smartphones (and they shouldn’t be). Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. This is why I was starting to convince myself the Quest 3S would start at around $350, or even $400 rather than being as cheap as the Quest 2 like many hoped. The strategy outlined in the leak above however is an alternative way to walk this pricing tightrope. Eliminating the cheaper Quest 3 helps to create more of a distinction between the Quest 3S models and the top of the line Quest 3, meaning we can have our super-affordable Quest 3S without as much risk of it cannibalizing its predecessor. Unfortunately, while the Meta Quest 3 will get a price drop according to the leaks, I suspect the 512GB model will land a little above the 128GB version’s current price of $499 / £479 / AU$799. If that’s the case, then when the 128GB model sells out the Quest 3 would get an effective price increase, which wouldn’t be ideal. We’ll have to wait and see what’s announced at Meta Connect 2024 and beyond, but if the leaks hold true I’d recommend trying to snatch up a 128GB Meta Quest 3 while you can as that’s looking like my pick for the best of the four Quest 3/3S models, and it might not be around for much longer.

September 24, 2024 06:30 ET | Source: Radisson Mining Resources Inc. Radisson Mining Resources Inc. ROUYN-NORANDA, Quebec, Sept. 24, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Radisson Mining Resources Inc. (TSX-V: RDS, OTCQB: RMRDF) (“Radisson” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce results from three deep diamond drill holes completed at its 100%-owned O’Brien Gold Project (“O’Brien” or the “Project”) located in the Abitibi region of Québec. These results are part of Radisson’s ongoing and fully-funded 35,000 metre drill program, and represent the first deep drill holes of the current campaign. The three drill holes reported today represent an approximately 200 metre wide fence to the west, centre and east of the down-plunge extension of a high grade mineralization trend at the Project labeled “Trend 1.” The fence was located at a vertical depth of approximately 1,100 metres, 170 metres below the base of the existing Mineral Resource and below the level of the historic workings at the adjacent O’Brien mine. Of note, DDH OB-24-324, the central hole of the fence located directly below “Trend 1”, returned a wide intersection of high-grade mineralization with extensive visible gold (Figures 1, 2 & 3 and Tables 1 & 2). Results Highlights: Matt Manson, President & CEO, commented: “The results reported today represent a significant extension of high-grade mineralization at the O’Brien Project at depth. We have successfully intersected the down plunge extension of one of the principal high-grade gold trends at O’Brien. The 6-metre core interval of almost an ounce per tonne gold in OB-24-324, well mineralized throughout and with extensive visible gold, was achieved in the location predicted by our deposit model at a vertical depth of approximately 1,100 metres, a full 170 metres below previous drilling. For context, approximately 75% of our existing Mineral Resource is defined at depths above 600 metres. The two other deep holes reported today also intersected vein mineralization within alteration zones at the same depth, confirming the lateral continuity of the O’Brien mineralizing system generally and with noteworthy high-grade intercepts in OB-24-322 in particular. Taken together, this deep drilling is demonstrating the significant upside potential of the Project below the existing Mineral Resource. Two rigs are currently active, one targeting shallower targets within the existing Mineral Resource model, and one continuing to target deeper, down-plunge step-outs. We will be reporting additional drill results as they become available.” Figure 1: Long Section and Plan View of Gold Vein Mineralization and Mineral Resources at the O’Brien Gold Project, with DDH OB-24-321, 322 and 324 illustrated. Gold Mineralization at O’Brien Gold mineralizing quartz-sulphide veins at O’Brien occur within a thin band of interlayered mafic volcanic rocks, conglomerates, and porphyric andesitic sills of the Piché Group occurring adjacent to the east-west oriented Larder Lake-Cadillac Break (“LLCB”). Gold, along with pyrite and arsenopyrite, is typically associated with shearing and a pervasive biotite alteration, and developed within multiple Piché Group lithologies and, occasionally, the hanging-wall Pontiac meta-sedimentary rocks. As mapped at the Historic O’Brien mine, and now replicated in the modern drilling, individual veins are generally narrow, ranging from several centimetres up to several metres in thickness. Multiple veins occur sub-parallel to each other, as well as sub-parallel to the Piché lithologies and the LLCB. Individual veins have well-established lateral continuity, with near-vertical, high-grade shoots developed over significant lengths. The historic O’Brien mine produced over half a million ounces of gold from such veins and shoots at an average grade exceeding 15 g/t and over a vertical extent of at least 1,000 metres. Based on the modern drilling, the Project has estimated Indicated Mineral Resources of 0.50 million ounces (1.52 million tonnes at 10.26 g/t Au), with additional Inferred Mineral Resources of 0.45 million ounces (1.62 million tonnes at 8.64 g/t Au). Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Current exploration is focussed on delineating well developed vein mineralization to the east of the historic mine, with additional high-grade shoots becoming evident in the exploration data over what has been described as a series of repeating trends (“Trends 0 to 5”, Table 1 and Figures 1 and 2). Table 1: Summary Assay Results from DDH OB-24-321, 322 and 324 Notes on Calculation of Drill InterceptsThe O’Brien Gold Project March 2023 Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”) utilizes a 4.50 g/t Au bottom cutoff, a US$1600 gold price, a minimum mining width of 1.2 metres, and a 40 g/t Au upper cap on composites. Intercepts presented in Table 1 are calculated with a 3.00 g/t Au bottom cut-off, representing the lower limit of cut-off sensitivity presented in the March 2023 MRE. This methodology differs from previous Radisson disclosure, and intercepts reported in this release may not be directly comparable to historical published intercepts. Sample grades are uncapped. True widths, based on depth of intercept and drill hole inclination, are estimated to be 40-80% of core length. Table 2 presents additional drill intercepts calculated with a 1.00 g/t bottom cut-off over a minimum 1.0 metre core length so as to illustrate the frequency and continuity of mineralized intervals within which high-grade gold veins at O’Brien are developed. Drill Hole OB-24-321 did not return any intercepts averaging above 3.00 g/t Au based on unofficial assays received to date (official assay certificates for three samples in OB-24-321, covering the interval italicised in Table 2, are pending). Lithology Codes: PON-S3: Pontiac Sediments; V3-S, V3-N, V3-CEN: Basalt-South, North, Central; S1P: Piché conglomerate; S3P: Piché sediments; POR-S, POR-N: Porphyry South, North. Today’s Drill Results Today’s results are from three drill holes over 3,660 metres in Trend 1. Visible gold was observed in each hole. Holes were drilled on northerly declinations at initial inclinations of between -77 and -85 degrees, providing a high angle of incidence with the southerly dip of the Piché Group rocks and the vein mineralization. Estimated true widths of drill intercepts at the point of contact with mineralization is estimated to be between 40 and 80% of core length.

Table 2: Detailed Assay Results (see “Notes on Calculation of Drill Intercepts”) Table 3: Drill Hole Collar Information for Holes contained in this News Release QA/QC All drill cores in this campaign are NQ in size. Assays were completed on sawn half-cores, with the second half kept for future reference. The samples were analyzed using standard fire assay procedures with Atomic Absorption (AA) finish at ALS Laboratory Ltd, in Val-d’Or, Quebec. Samples yielding a grade higher than 10 g/t Au were analyzed a second time by fire assay with gravimetric finish at the same laboratory.

Title: 3 reasons why investors should remain bullish on Apple stock: Needham
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/3-reasons-why-investors-should-remain-bullish-on-apple-stock-needham-3629316

Investing.com -- Needham & Company analysts provided three key reasons why investors should remain bullish on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock despite concerns about its dependence on the iPhone. The firm maintained a Buy rating on the stock in a note Tuesday, with a target price of $260 per share, representing a 16% upside. A Liquid Stock During Uncertainty: The analysts note that while competitors like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) are heavily investing in generative AI (GenAI) infrastructure with no immediate revenue boost, Apple stands out as a stable and liquid stock. In a volatile market, they argue that investors need a reliable stock to "hide in" during 2025, making Apple an attractive option. Share Repurchases Driving EPS Growth: Needham says Apple is actively reducing its equity base through share buybacks, which is expected to drive earnings per share (EPS) growth. The company's $110 billion share repurchase authorization from May 2024 is projected to lead to 11% EPS growth in fiscal year 2025 and 12% in 2026, according to Needham estimates. This continued buyback strategy is expected to support the bullish outlook for Apple. Strong Cash Position Enables Further Buybacks: Needham believes Apple's commitment to achieving "net cash zero" from its current net cash position of about $50 billion, along with $91 billion in cash from operations reported in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, suggests accelerated share repurchases in the near future. This financial strategy is expected to further enhance shareholder returns. Despite concerns about Apple's reliance on the iPhone and its slower pace of GenAI adoption compared to peers, Needham & Company believes Apple's financial discipline and stock buyback strategy make it a strong investment opportunity.

Title: Bernard Arnault plummets down the list of world’s richest men after a $54 billion collapse
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/09/24/bernard-arnault-richest-man/
Time Published: 2024-09-24T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
“As long as I’m not the richest man in the world, I won’t really be happy,” Bernard Arnault once said. The day has come. Arnault, the founder and CEO of luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, went from being the richest person in the world to the fifth-most after a 20% drop in his company’s stock price, resulting in a $54 billion cut of his net worth. Arnault, who oversees dozens of prestigious brands including Moët Hennessy, Louis Vuitton, Dior, Givenchy, and Fendi, was worth an estimated $231 billion in late March, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That placed him ahead of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. As of Monday, Arnault was worth an estimated $177 billion. Now, Arnault ranks lower than each of those executives, plus Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. In the past year, LVMH stock has dropped over 16%, and is currently trading at about $132 per share; Arnault owns about 48% of the luxury conglomerate. Since the start of 2024, Arnault’s net worth is down $30 billion, making him the biggest loser on the list year-to-date. LVMH did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment. During the first half of 2024, LVMH reported a modest dip in revenues, but its wine and spirits divisions fared even worse. “Maybe the current global situation, be it geopolitical or macroeconomic, doesn’t lead people to cheer up and open bottles of champagne,” Jean-Jacques Guiony, LVMH’s chief financial officer, said during the company’s earnings call in late July. “I don’t really know. The matter of fact is, is that our volumes are down double digits.” But it’s not just LVMH that’s had a tough time in today’s market. Other major luxury brands and holding houses have reported losses this year. In fact, luxury revenues were flat during Q2 2024, the slowest growth in 15 quarters, according to a Bank of America note about luxury goods released Monday. Demand deteriorated during July, and August and September have also slowed. Michael Kors, housed under Capri Holdings, saw its first quarter revenue drop more than 14% year-over-year, according to Capri’s first quarter fiscal 2025 results posted Aug. 8. “Sometimes you’ll be the hottest thing on the block,” Michael Kors said in his testimony during an $8.5 billion antitrust trial involving Capri Holdings and Tapestry. “Sometimes you’ll be lukewarm. Sometimes you’ll be cold.” While Arnault has lost a tremendous amount of wealth this year as the result of the struggling luxury market, with a net worth of $177 billion, he’s still wealthier than former Microsoft CEOs Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer, as well as Warren Buffett, Michael Dell, and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. Plus, Arnault has stayed active in investing this year. His family office has invested in five AI-focused startups this year amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars. Plus, in July, he joined the chase to acquire Venice’s iconic Hotel Bauer for $305 million—but got outbid. Arnault, 75, isn’t ready to leave his post: He forced his board to extend the retirement age for its chairman and CEO from 75 to 80 so he could stay longer. But he received a letter from 93-year-old Warren Buffett saying he should’ve made the age limit higher, according to Bloomberg. Still, Arnault says he’s working 12-hour days. “Every morning I have fun when I arrive,” Arnault told Bloomberg. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

NEW YORK – US stocks closed modestly higher on Sept 23 as investors assessed whether a trend will develop in the week following the Federal Reserve’s rate cut. The gains came amid comments from Fed policymakers and steady factory activity data, building on last week’s sharp market rally after the central bank’s decision to lower interest rates. The Fed’s pivotal move last week pushed major indexes to monthly gains, defying the historical trend of September as a weak month for equities. Comments on Sept 23 from three reserve bank presidents were the main focus as investors searched for clues on why the central bank kicked off its easing cycle with an outsized 50 basis-point cut. Fed officials including Mr Raphael Bostic, Mr Neel Kashkari and Mr Austan Goolsbee supported the central bank’s last rate cut and voiced support for more cuts in the rest of the year. Trader bets, as per the CME Group’s FedWatch tool, initially favoured a larger Fed move at its upcoming November meeting, after Governor Christopher Waller on Sept 20 flagged that upcoming inflation data could undershoot the Fed’s 2 per cent target. However, the bets have swayed since then and now appear to be a coin-toss, with markets expecting a total reduction of 74 basis points by the year end, according to LSEG data. On the data front, US business activity remained steady in September, while average prices for goods and services increased at the fastest pace in six months, potentially signalling a rise in inflation in the months ahead. “I think investors are still just sort of taking a wait-and-see attitude, if indeed a soft landing is the most likely outcome.” said Mr Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 61.29 points, or 0.15 per cent, to 42,124.65, the S&P 500 gained 16.02 points, or 0.28 per cent, to 5,718.57 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 25.95 points, or 0.14 per cent, to 17,974.27. Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors were higher. Energy stocks led gains with a 1.31 per cent rise, while healthcare stocks declined 0.25 per cent. Among rate-sensitive growth stocks, Tesla jumped 4.65 per cent, while Meta Platforms rose 0.6 per cent after Citigroup lifted its price target on the stock. The Russell 2000 index, tracking small caps, was off 0.25 per cent. All eyes are on Sept 27’s personal consumption expenditures figure for August – the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge. Analysts say this release will be the week’s most significant catalyst. Among top movers, Intel rose 3.05 per cent after a media report said Apollo offered to make an investment of as much as US$5 billion (S$6.46 billion) in the chipmaker. General Motors slipped 1.72 per cent after Bernstein downgraded the carmaker’s stock to “market perform” from “outperform”. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.48-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. There were 505 new highs and 36 new lows on the NYSE. The S&P 500 posted 62 new 52-week highs and one new low while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 80 new highs and 123 new lows.

Title: Goldman Sachs maintains buy on Arista Networks, price target $430
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/goldman-sachs-maintains-buy-on-arista-networks-price-target-430-93CH-3628796
Time Published: 2024-09-23T21:04:15Z
Full Content:
On Monday, Goldman Sachs reiterated a Buy rating on Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) with a steady price target of $430.00. The firm is projecting Arista Networks to achieve approximately 20% revenue growth in 2024 and 2025, citing increased confidence in their earnings per share (EPS) estimates for these years. The revised EPS estimate for 2024 is now $8.39, up from the previous $8.35 and higher than the FactSet consensus of $8.27. For 2025, the EPS estimate has been set at $9.91, compared to the prior $9.86 and above the consensus of $9.39. The optimism from Goldman Sachs is based on several key factors, including anticipated capital expenditure from Arista's major cloud customers, such as Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The firm also highlighted the transition from pilot to production in three significant AI cluster projects expected in the next year and the momentum in Ethernet deployments across Arista's target five major AI cluster projects. Additionally, the firm noted Arista's expectations of increased front end networking investment relative to back end spending. Arista Networks' competitive edge is attributed to its top-tier switching platform, which offers scale up and scale out capabilities. This positions the company favorably in a market that is increasingly adopting integrated compute systems. Goldman Sachs anticipates that Arista will not only meet its $750 million AI revenue target in 2025 but will also continue to grow beyond that year. Goldman Sachs expects Arista Networks to outperform in the third quarter of 2024, surpassing revenue and margin expectations. This forecast aligns with the company's history of exceeding the midpoint of its EBIT margin guidance by an average of approximately 260 basis points over the last 26 quarters. In other recent news, Arista Networks has been in the spotlight with significant developments. The company reported a robust Q2 performance, with revenues reaching $1.69 billion, indicating a 15.9% increase year-over-year, primarily driven by services and software support renewals. Evercore ISI maintained its Outperform rating for Arista, based on the potential revenue opportunity from Meta's development of a massive new AI model training cluster. This could result in a possible $250 million in revenue for Arista if they secure the contract. Goldman Sachs reaffirmed its Buy rating on Arista, projecting a revenue growth target of at least 14% in 2024, while Deutsche Bank maintained its Hold rating, suggesting a positive outlook for the company's growth potential through 2025. Arista also repurchased $172 million of its common stock and generated $989 million in operating cash. These recent developments underscore the company's strong market position and potential for continued growth. However, it's important to note that operating expenses increased to $319.8 million due to higher headcount and new product introduction costs. With these developments, Arista Networks continues to make strides in its industry. As Goldman Sachs maintains a bullish stance on Arista Networks, citing robust revenue growth and competitive advantages, InvestingPro data and tips provide additional insights for investors considering ANET stock. The company's strong financial health is reflected in a market capitalization of $121.21 billion and significant revenue growth, with the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 showing a 19.93% increase. This aligns with Goldman Sachs' revenue growth projections for 2024 and 2025. InvestingPro Tips highlight Arista Networks as a prominent player in the Communications Equipment industry with a high return over the last year, suggesting investor confidence in the company's performance and strategy. Additionally, the company's liquid assets exceed short-term obligations, indicating a solid position to meet its financial commitments. However, investors should be aware of the stock trading at a high earnings multiple, with a P/E ratio of 48.95, and near its 52-week high, which could imply a premium valuation. For those seeking a deeper dive into Arista Networks' financial health and stock performance, InvestingPro offers 17 additional tips to help investors make informed decisions.

Former president has said he has 'absolutely no intention' of selling his shares in company that operates Truth Social By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Shares of Donald Trump’s social media company, which operates the unprofitable Truth Social platform, dropped 10.3% Monday to their lowest price since the stock began trading under the ticker symbol “DJT” earlier in 2024. Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) stock closed at $12.15/share, down nearly 82% from the company’s peak closing price of $66.22/share on March 27. The slump for the stock comes after a six-month lockup period on shares held by TMTG insiders — including Trump, TMTG’s directors and officers, and certain other securityholders — expired at the end of regular trading Thursday, Sept. 19. Related Stories VIP+ ‘Beetlejuice Beetlejuice’ Success Doesn’t Downplay Risky Reboots Coming to Theaters Justin Timberlake Pleads Guilty in Drunk Driving Case, Ordered to Pay $500 Fine and Community Service Trump has said he has “absolutely no intention of selling” his shares in TMTG. “A lot of people think the reason [the company’s stock price is] down is a lot of people think I’m going to sell, and if I sell, it’s not going to be the same,” Trump said at a Sept. 13 press conference, per CBS News. “But I have absolutely no intention of selling.” Popular on Variety TMTG’s market capitalization currently stands at about $2.4 billion. That’s down from an intraday peak of more than $9.5 billion on March 26, CNBC reported. As of Aug. 15, Trump beneficially owned 56.6% of TMTG’s outstanding shares, making his stake currently worth about $1.4 billion — down from $5.2 billion at stock’s the highest closing price. The 114.75 million shares Trump holds includes 36 million “earnout shares” that TMTG determined he was entitled to in accordance with the merger agreement. TMTG calls Truth Social a “safe harbor for free expression amid increasingly harsh censorship by Big Tech corporations.” For the second quarter of 2024, TMTG reported $836,900 in net sales and a net loss of $16.37 million, per its 10-Q SEC filing for the period. For Q1, the company reported $770,500 in revenue and a net loss of $327.6 million; most of the loss for the first three months of the year was due to expenses associated with TMTG’s merger with special purpose acquisition company Digital World Acquisition Corp. to become a publicly traded company. According to an Aug. 23 filing with the SEC, TMTG’s board and audit committee authorized a share repurchase of an aggregate of 128,138 shares of the company’s common stock “from certain executive employees” at a prevailing market price of $22.70 per share. As consideration for the repurchase, TMTG said, it will remit $2.9 million plus applicable penalties and interest to the IRS and certain state taxing authorities in connection with the March 7 issuance of the TMTG Executive Promissory Notes. “TMTG’s success depends in part on the popularity of our brand and the reputation and popularity of President Donald J. Trump,” the company said in its most recent 10-Q filing. “The value of TMTG’s brand may diminish if the popularity of President Donald J. Trump were to suffer. Adverse reactions to publicity relating to President Donald J. Trump, or the loss of his services, could adversely affect TMTG’s revenues, results of operations and its ability to maintain or generate a consumer base.” The filing also noted that Trump “is involved in numerous lawsuits and other matters that could damage his reputation.” Shares in TMTG began trading on Nasdaq on March 26, 2024, under the ticker symbol “DJT” following the company’s merger with DWAC. Trump formed TMTG in 2021 after the former president had been kicked off Twitter (now called X), Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and other internet platforms, which said he had violated prohibitions against inciting violence in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Trump’s accounts have been reinstated by X, Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, YouTube and others, but he continues to use Truth Social as his preferred social media platform. Truth Social launched in early 2022. “TMTG was founded to fight back against the big tech companies — Meta (Facebook, Instagram and Threads), X (formerly Twitter), Netflix, Alphabet (Google), Amazon and others — that may curtail debate in America and censor voices that contradict their ‘woke’ ideology,” the company says in its prospectus. TMTG has not disclosed how many people use Truth Social. “At this juncture in its development, TMTG believes that adhering to traditional key performance indicators, such as signups, average revenue per user, ad impressions and pricing, or active user accounts including monthly and daily active users, could potentially divert its focus from strategic evaluation with respect to the progress and growth of its business,” it says in an updated prospectus filed Sept. 5.

Title: European shares end higher as markets bet on more ECB policy easing

European shares closed higher on Monday as a soft business activity reading strengthened the case for more monetary policy easing by the European Central Bank this year, with rate-sensitive sectors such as real estate and utilities rising. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index closed 0.4 per cent higher, recouping some losses following its biggest one-day drop since August in the last session. Autos led gains among major Stoxx sectors with a 1.9 per cent advance, while retail also gained 1.2 per cent. A survey showed euro zone business activity contracted sharply and unexpectedly this month as the bloc’s dominant services industry flatlined while a downturn in manufacturing accelerated. “A payback from the Paris Olympics was largely expected. But today’s release was much worse than many had anticipated, suggesting a rather gloomy underlying growth picture for the euro zone,” said Fabio Balboni, senior economist, euro zone at HSBC. Ryanair traded flat on the day despite announcing that it had arranged to fly the Leinster rugby team to its European fixtures this season from Belfast instead of Dublin Airport amid an ongoing farrago over the annual passenger cap at the aviation hub. As expectations of further monetary easing by the European Central Bank increased both AIB and Bank of Ireland lost ground, declining 3.86 per cent and 1.53 per cent respectively. Food giant Kerry traded up 1.85 per cent €90.60 on the back positive sentiment for the sector. Other movers included home-builder Cairn, which fell 1 per cent to €1.89. Germany’s DAX closed 0.7 per cent up while France’s benchmark ended near flat, bogged down by falling bank stocks. French banks including Credit Agricole, SocGen and BNP Paribas were among top declines on the Stoxx index, with the euro zone banks index sliding 1.8 per cent. The euro slipped against the dollar, while the yield on the German two-year bond, which reflects near-term rate expectations, slipped to 2.149 per cent. Rate-sensitive real estate rose 1.3 per cent while utilities, often traded as a bond proxy, gained 1.1 per cent. The ECB cut interest rates in June and also earlier this month. Among individual stock moves, Germany’s Commerzbank slid 5.7 per cent after Berlin said it does not support a takeover by Italy’s UniCredit. UniCredit shares closed 3.3 per cent lower. Aurubis dropped 10.1 per cent after Europe’s largest copper producer guided for lower earnings next financial year as it expects metal prices to fall and after hurdles with a production ramp-up hit its fourth-quarter earnings. UK shares ended higher on Monday after logging their worst day since August in the previous session, boosted by rising commodity-linked shares, while drugmaker AstraZeneca fell following a disappointing experimental precision drug trial. The blue-chip FTSE 100 closed 0.4 per cent higher, while the more domestically-focused FTSE 250 midcap index added 0.1 per cent. Precious metal miners led gains among the major FTSE 350 indexes with a more than 2 per cent rise as gold prices scaled record highs, driven by Fed rate cuts and demand for the safe-haven asset on geopolitical risks in the Middle East. Heavyweight energy shares added 0.6 per cent, tracking elevated crude oil prices. Both indexes had notched up their worst day in nearly seven weeks on Friday after the Bank of England held interest rates steady on Thursday, even as the Federal Reserve cut benchmark rates by an outsized 50 basis points. Last week Britain’s consumer price inflation data – which is closely watched by the Bank of England for its monetary policy – pointed to persistent price pressures in the services sector. AstraZeneca slipped 1.7 per cent after the drugmaker said its experimental precision drug did not significantly improve overall survival for patients with a type of breast cancer in a late-stage trial. Wall Street’s main indexes trended higher in choppy trading on Monday as investors focused on comments from Federal Reserve policymakers and steady factory activity data following the central bank’s decision to commence monetary policy easing. The Fed’s pivotal move on monetary policy in the previous week propped up the main indexes for monthly gains, bucking a historical trend where September has been a weak month for equities on average. Comments from a number of policymakers were the main focus on the day as investors scoured for clues on why the central bank kicked off its easing cycle with an outsized 50 basis points cut. Fed presidents such as Raphael Bostic, Neel Kashkari and Austan Goolsbee supported the central bank’s last rate cut and voiced support for more cuts in the rest of the year. Ten out of the 11 S&P 500 sectors were higher. Real estate stocks lead gains with a 0.9 per cent rise, while healthcare stocks declined 0.1 per cent. Having rallied for much of the year, the S&P 500 is a whisker away from an all-time high and the blue-chip Dow hit another intraday record high. Among rate-sensitive growth stocks, Tesla jumped 4.8 per cent, while Meta rose 1 per cent after Citigroup lifted its price target on the stock. – Additional reporting by Reuters Eoin Burke-Kennedy is Economics Correspondent of The Irish Times Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Microsoft shares downgraded to neutral with no change in price target

DA Davidson has revised its rating on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), transitioning from a "Buy" to a "Neutral" stance, while keeping the price target unchanged at $475.00. The adjustment comes amidst observations that competitors have caught up with Microsoft in the AI segment, which has been a significant factor in the company's previously high valuation. According to DA Davidson, the competitive landscape in AI technology has evolved to a point where Microsoft's leading edge has diminished. This change has led to a reassessment of the tech giant's stock, resulting in a downgrade. Despite this, the firm has decided to maintain the existing price target for Microsoft's shares. The firm's analysis places Microsoft at the fourth position within the Mag6 ranking, a leaderboard of major tech companies that includes Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google's parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), with Microsoft now trailing behind Amazon, Meta, and Apple. The Mag6 is often used as a benchmark to gauge the performance and valuation of leading tech companies. Microsoft's stock performance has been notably robust, with an increase of 92% since DA Davidson initiated coverage in January 2023. This growth outpaced the S&P 500's rise of 49% during the same period, highlighting Microsoft's strong market performance relative to the broader index. In other recent news, Constellation Energy and Microsoft have joined forces to restart a unit of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. This initiative is in response to the growing demand for electricity by tech companies, particularly for data centers that support advanced technologies. The revival will focus on Unit 1 of the facility, with an investment of approximately $1.6 billion and an expected operational date by 2028. Microsoft has agreed to purchase energy from the reactivated plant for a period of 20 years. Meanwhile, Google has made a significant move into the carbon offset market by purchasing 50,000 metric tons of nature-based carbon removal credits from a Brazilian startup named Mombak. This agreement represents Google's first venture into Brazilian carbon projects and is part of a larger commitment to achieve these credits by 2030. In a recent development, Mizuho reaffirmed its positive outlook on Microsoft shares, maintaining an Outperform rating following the announcement of a new $60 billion share repurchase program and a nearly 11% increase in its quarterly dividend. These financial strategies signal Microsoft's ongoing commitment to returning value to shareholders and confidence in its future performance. Similarly, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)., the parent company of Facebook, has entered into an agreement with BTG Pactual’s forestry arm to acquire up to 3.9 million carbon offset credits. This deal extends through 2038 and is part of Meta’s strategy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030. The credits originate from BTG Pactual Timberland Investment Group's forest restoration efforts in Latin America. As Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) faces a shifting competitive landscape in AI technology, it's essential to consider various financial metrics that offer a broader understanding of the company's current market position. With a market capitalization of $2.4 trillion, Microsoft stands as a colossal player in the tech industry. The company's P/E ratio, a measure of its current share price relative to its per-share earnings, is 36.79, indicating a high valuation in the market. This is further emphasized by its P/E ratio for the last twelve months as of Q4 2024, which is slightly lower at 36.61. Microsoft's revenue growth remains solid, with a 15.67% increase over the last twelve months as of Q4 2024, showcasing the company's ability to expand its sales. Additionally, the firm's gross profit margin of 69.76% during the same period reflects its efficiency in controlling the costs associated with its goods and services. From an investment standpoint, two InvestingPro Tips highlight Microsoft's financial stability and market presence. The company has raised its dividend for 19 consecutive years, demonstrating a commitment to returning value to shareholders. Moreover, Microsoft is recognized as a prominent player in the software industry, which aligns with its historical performance and the maintained price target by DA Davidson despite the downgrade to a "Neutral" stance. For investors looking for more in-depth analysis and additional tips, InvestingPro offers a total of 15 InvestingPro Tips for Microsoft, which can be accessed through the platform to aid in making informed investment decisions.

Title: FTC trustbuster Lina Khan: feared in boardrooms, cheered on by progressive

Full Content:
Watch CBS News By Lesley Stahl September 22, 2024 / 7:00 PM EDT / CBS News Everywhere you go people are complaining about inflation: voters say it's their number one issue. Enter trustbuster Lina Khan – the youngest chair ever of the Federal Trade Commission – just 32 when she was named. She says much of the blame for the exorbitant prices on everything from food to concert tickets, is widespread corporate consolidation. The FTC's mission is breaking illegal monopolies, blocking mergers that stifle competition, and protecting consumers from a system Lina Khan says is rigged against them. But she's so aggressive that she's feared and loathed in boardrooms - seen as a zealot and a bully, and yet -- At town hall meetings around the country, Lina Khan is often swarmed by young people taking selfies, small business owners giving her cards, union members – to whom she preaches the perils of business monopolies. Lina Khan: Too often fewer and fewer companies are controlling more and more of the market. And what that means is companies can start ripping you off, hiking prices, stealing from you. She calls these events her "listening tours," that she does in both red and blue districts -- this one hosted by Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Crowd Member: Every time I go to the supermarket, I get sticker shock. Groceries are so expensive now. What can be done to help people like me who are worried about grocery prices? Thank you. Lina Khan: The FTC is currently in court trying to block the largest grocery merger in U.S. history. Between Kroger – that owns Ralph's - and Albertsons, that owns Safeway. Together they have nearly 5,000 locations. Khan says this merger risks raising food prices even higher than they are now. Lesley Stahl: Grocery prices have gone through the roof. I believe that you think it's because of monopolies, but most economists say that it's because of supply chains caused by Covid and the Ukraine war. So which is it? Lina Khan: So there's no doubt that the pandemic and the war led prices to soar. What's been interesting is that even as some of those supply chain pressures have eased, prices have not come down concurrently as much. Lesley Stahl: So instead of inflation, are you contending that it's greedflation? That these monopolies are deliberately hiking the prices? Lina Khan: So there's a lot of discussion about what's driving the inflation and we've actually seen some executives boast on earnings calls about how inflation is great for their bottom line. Lesley Stahl: They say that? Lina Khan: They have said that publicly, yes. Lesley Stahl: What about the argument that when companies merge prices often come down, because of efficiencies, scale? Lina Khan: But even if those efficiencies arise, if the company's not checked by competition it won't have an incentive to pass those benefits on to the consumer because those consumers may not have anywhere else to go. Another consumer concern: the high cost of medicine. Pharmacist: As far as negotiating prices— Khan talks to independent pharmacists about the tricks and traps she says big pharma uses to jack up prices. For example, she zeroed in on the makers of asthma inhalers for extending their patents to keep low-cost generics off the shelves. Lesley Stahl: On these inhalers, they cost $7 in France. The same exact inhaler is around $500 in the United States. Wow. Now, something's out of whack. Lina Khan: We agree. So we took a close look at this and we found that companies were listing patents for things like the inhaler cap or the strap on your inhaler, so nothing to do with the actual ingredients of the drug or the formulation or composition of the drug. Lesley Stahl: So this is an inhaler for asthma. Show us what the innovation was that they claimed allowed them to extend the patent. Lina Khan: So it's this strap that they listed a patent for, this little piece of plastic. Lesley Stahl: No! They were saying that they should be able to continue the patent; generics can't come in for the medication, because they put that strap on-- Lina Khan: That's right-- Lesley Stahl: --to make sure you didn't lose the cap. Lina Khan: That's right. After the FTC sent warning letters to the four major inhaler makers, three of them – including this one - dropped the price from hundreds of dollars to just 35. And two days ago, the FTC filed a lawsuit to bring down the price of insulin and scores of other drugs, suing three companies the agency says are responsible for manipulating most of the prices. Lina Khan: These really fundamental things about people's daily material lives are affected by things like antitrust. But investment bankers, venture capitalists, and top CEOs say she's biased against them - that Lina Khan picks on winners because they're winners and thinks big is always bad. Lesley Stahl: Actually, Khan's doggedness represents a shift in policy, a mandate to reverse decades of a hands-off strategy toward mergers and acquisitions. It was introduced by Ronald Reagan and adopted by all presidents since, including Clinton and Obama, until President Biden put an end to it. President Biden (in 2021): We are now 40 years into the experiment of letting giant corporations accumulate more and more power, and where-- what have we gotten from it? Less growth, weakened investment, fewer small businesses. Under President Biden the FTC and the Justice Department have unleashed a crackdown, suing scores of companies, including Ticketmaster, Nvidia, and the big five: Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Apple, and a court just deemed Google an illegal monopoly. It's a revolution, and the face of it is Lina Khan. Male Student: We're all law students and we love you. Female Student: Can we have a selfie? Lina Khan: Sure! Male Student: Three, two, one. Thank you. When Khan was a student here at Yale Law School, she wrote a paper called "Amazon's Antitrust Paradox" contending that even though Amazon's prices are low, it's still a monopoly. Lesley Stahl: This was seen as an extraordinary breakthrough. And it went viral. Less than five years later, President Biden made her head of the agency that polices Amazon. Lesley Stahl: You know, Amazon is a very popular company. People like the convenience, the choice, the prices are pretty moderate. And they're afraid that you're gonna tamper with something that's good, that they like. Lina Khan: Our investigation uncovered that Amazon's illegal practices were actually raising prices for consumers because it had illegally muscled out rivals, locked them out of the market in ways that if you had more competition that Amazon hadn't squashed, consumers would be even better off. Amazon denies doing anything illegal and says if Khan wins, prices will go up. Also in the FTC's crosshairs: the issue of tech giants buying up smaller companies. Lina Khan: In the technology markets we went through a couple of decades where we saw over 800 acquisitions by the five big players, not a single one of which was blocked. And some of those we realize ended up leading to significant harm. Just to give you a concrete example, there were companies that were offering Americans greater privacy and they were promising that we're not gonna use your data, we're not gonna sell it, we're not gonna spy on you everywhere all the time. After some of those firms were bought up by one of the big guys, all of those data privacy policies changed overnight. And so Americans lost those privacy protections. Lesley Stahl: You're talking about Facebook and WhatsApp? Lina Khan: Yes, that's one example of that. She's now suing over Facebook's acquisitions of Whatsapp and Instagram. Lesley Stahl: Is the mandate to reverse what's gone on for 40 years, to undo some of the mergers that were approved. Lina Khan: We've identified not just one merger, but a whole string of mergers that some of these large companies made that we believe were illegal, that we believe were anti-competitive. Lesley Stahl: But they were approved. Lina Khan: They were not blocked, they were not challenged. But the courts don't always side with her. The FTC has lost a couple of big cases against Meta and Microsoft. Yet her cage-rattling has had a chilling effect where companies simply drop their merger plans. Lina Khan: Sometimes, you know, the companies decide that they're gonna abandon the merger. Lesley Stahl: If someone just says, "I'm not going to go forward," that's a win? Lina Khan: That's right. Lesley Stahl: Obviously the companies are complaining like hell, screaming. They don't like you. They're afraid of you. Lina Khan: Well, look, we're doing our job enforcing the law-- and— Lesley Stahl: They are they're afraid you're going to tie 'em up in court, you're going to cost them a lot of money and they're saying, "It's just not worth it." Lina Khan: So it's important to step back and keep all of this in context. Of all the thousands of deals that are proposed every year, the FTC and DOJ collectively investigate maybe 2% or 3%. That might not sound like a lot, but start-up founders complain that she's spooking investors so much, she's actually stifling innovation. Others fear that her chasing the tech giants will cause a domino effect. Earlier this month, after it was reported that her counterpart at the Justice Department subpoenaed the chip maker Nvidia the stock market plunged. Lesley Stahl: Do you ever worry about the power that the FTC and the chairman have that could result in a destabilizing of basically the whole economy? Lina Khan: Of course we have to worry. But we also should worry about the destabilizing effect that can arise from companies believing that they're above the law, and that they can be reckless, take massive risks in ways that can crash the economy, and then they can get away with just a slap on the wrist. And that creates a destabilization too. Khan can be seen as a belated reaction to the financial crisis when the government decided banks were "too big to fail." But has the pendulum swung too far? Corporations are pushing back with their own lawsuits to rein her in, setting up a possible showdown at the Supreme Court over the fate of the FTC. Lesley Stahl: Should you be concerned that you are flirting with diminishing the muscle-- the powers that you have if the Court decides you're wrong? And this Court could very likely say you're wrong. Lina Khan: I think one challenge that agencies can face is when they shrink their own powers and authorities by not actually using the authorities that Congress has given them. She's obviously unlikely to survive in her job if former President Trump wins, though she's admired by vice presidential nominee JD Vance – Sen. JD Vance: Well look, I don't agree with Lina Khan on every issue to be clear, but I think that she's been very smart about trying to go after some of these big tech companies. She's surprisingly popular with other MAGA Republicans. Lesley Stahl: There's even a nickname for conservatives who support you. What is it? Lina Khan: I'll let you– Lesley Stahl: Khan-servatives. Khan-servatives. On the flip side, it's unclear she would keep her job if Vice President Harris wins. Lesley Stahl: Some of her biggest donors are people who want her to get rid of you. They want you off the scene. And they're not just saying it privately. They're going on television. Lina Khan: Look, you know, my focus is not listening to what CEOs are saying on TV. You know, it's important in these jobs to really stay focused and block out a lot of the noise. Lesley Stahl: If you were asked to keep this job, would you say yes? Lina Khan: Obviously, those are conversations one has with one's family and that sort of thing. But— Lesley Stahl: You don't wanna have it with me? Lina Khan: But absolutely, I mean, there's so much work to be done, and it's such an honor to be in this role. And it would be an honor to have that opportunity to keep going.

Title: After The Fed Rate Cut: Soft Landing Checklist
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2024/09/22/after-the-fed-rate-cut-soft-landing-checklist/
Time Published: 2024-09-22T10:38:32Z

While the aggressive rate cut was a good start, whether it will prevent the economy from descending ... [+] into recession remain unknown. This article will identify some data to gauge the effectiveness of the Fed’s actions in supporting the economy. Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve delivered a larger-than-expected half percentage point (0.50%) decrease in short-term interest rates last week. While the rate cut was a virtual certainty, the path forward and whether it will prevent the economy from descending into recession remain unknown. This piece will identify some data to gauge the effectiveness of the Fed’s actions in supporting the economy. Because of the aggressive first move from the Fed, the odds of an economic soft landing should be considered higher than before the move. Though the real (after-inflation) Federal Funds rate remains above 2023, there are likely more rate cuts in the pipeline. After-Inflation Federal Funds Rate Futures pricing assumes another cut to short-term interest rates of at least 25 (0.25%) basis points at the November Fed meeting and a 50% chance of a 50 (0.50%) basis point rate cut. The December meeting has expectations identical to those for November. Number Of Rate Cuts Expected In seven of the last nine easing cycles, the economy was either in recession when the rate cuts began or ended in recession. Still, stocks usually rose in the twelve months after the cuts started. Stocks and the Magnificent 7 reacted positively to the outsized rate cut. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), underperformed the S&P 500 on the week but are now only 6.6% below their early July highs. The S&P 500 reached a new all-time high during the week, eclipsing the July 16 high. Stock Market Performance The U.S. economy remains resilient, with the Atlanta Fed’s estimate of third-quarter GDP at 2.9%. These estimates provide a real-time estimate of economic growth since quarterly GDP reports are provided with a significant lag. 3Q 2024 U.S. GDP Growth Estimate Other valuable high-frequency reports are the initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits. These claims have improved lately, but any significant softening in the labor market should be seen here first. Initial Jobless Claims The job market has softened. While the unemployment rate at 4.2% remains low on an absolute basis, it has risen off the lows enough to trigger the Sahm Rule, which has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession. There are several reasons to believe that the Sahm Rule might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle. Monitoring the prime-age, 25 to 54 years old, employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The rising prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence of some less dire outcomes in the labor market and the economy so far. The employment-to-population ratio is a monthly statistic updated in the monthly jobs report, and so is the unemployment rate. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio: 3 Month Average Separately, defensive stocks, less impacted by the economy, have often outperformed the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks during these easing cycles since they tend to correspond with periods of economic uncertainty or eventual contraction. Last week showed a better performance for economically sensitive stocks, bolstering the case that markets also viewed the Fed’s actions as supportive of better odds of avoiding recession. Cyclicals Versus Defensives Banks tend to underperform the S&P 500 before and often during recessions since their loan losses and profits are inexorably tied to the economy. Bank stocks significantly outperformed last week, adding to the optimistic view of the impacts of the more significant Fed rate cut on the economy. U.S. Banks Relative Performance Finally, the consumer is crucial for the health of the economy. Looking at the relative performance of the consumer discretionary sector can help indicate when the consumer and, by extension, the U.S. economy might be in trouble. The equal-weighted S&P 500 consumer discretionary index is used; otherwise, Amazon.com (AMZN) would dominate the analysis given its massive size in the capitalization-weighted index. Consistent with the other measures shown, consumer discretionary stocks outperformed. Consumer Discretionary Relative Strength Based on the indicators reviewed in this analysis and current economic data, the base case remains a soft landing. This COVID-related economic cycle is unlike any other, so our typically reliable yield curve and Sahm rule indicators should be viewed more skeptically than usual. The initial reaction to the larger-than-expected 50 basis point rate cut from the Fed has been positive across the soft landing checklist. It indicates that market participants are assigning higher odds of avoiding recession following Chair Powell’s aggressive start to easing monetary policy. If history is any indicator, success in avoiding a recession is no sure thing. Since markets reflect a higher likelihood of a soft landing, investors should expect price declines for stocks and other risk assets if recession probabilities increase. Since the eventual outcome remains unknown, investors should be mindful of their asset allocation and consider rebalancing after the robust stock gains. Owning high-quality and less economically sensitive stocks alongside technology and cyclical companies should benefit equity portfolios if the economy and earnings falter. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Alphabet (GOOGL) within its recommended investment strategies.

Title: Market Lessons: 20 Companies With Dazzling Growth In Revenue Per Share
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/baldwin/2024/09/21/market-lessons-20-companies-with-dazzling-growth-in-revenue-per-share/
Time Published: 2024-09-21T10:30:00Z
Full Content:
Pornpimone Audkamkong/Getty Images W hat makes a growth stock? The first thing most investors look at is the earnings per share. But there’s a case to be made for giving equal attention to revenue growth. More precisely, you want companies whose revenue per share figure is growing at an impressive exponential rate. Winners on this score include such Wall Street favorites as Tesla, Block (the parent company of the Square payment network) and Meta Platforms (Facebook, that is). Ahead of them in the rankings are some less familiar names: Cheniere Energy, which exports liquified natural gas; Alnylam, a money-losing but very promising developer of RNA-based medicines, and MercadoLibre, a Latin American e-commerce platform whose shares see heavy trading on Nasdaq. Some smart investors have zeroed in on the top lines of companies. One was Charles Allmon (1921 – 2015), whose long-running Growth Stock Outlook newsletter included half a dozen stocks that appreciated more than 10,000% while on the recommended list. In an interview with Forbes on the occasion of his retirement at age 87, Allmon explained his philosophy. "In the long run a company cannot grow any faster than its sales," he said. "I look at sales first, earnings second and balance sheet third." Yes, earning growth matters a lot, and it’s scored in our review of earnings growers (see story list at bottom). But here we consider only revenue, not what companies get out of it. The sorting is by growth in revenue per share, since a boost in revenue made possible by a dilution of the share base doesn’t do much good for investors. Example: International Flavors & Fragrances, which makes chemicals for food and perfume aromas, looks pretty good in total revenue, better than tripling it over the past decade. But it has tripled its share count in that period. Its revenue per share growth comes in at an unimpressive 3% a year. Contrast that to Oracle Corporation, which sells software to maintain corporate databases. It is using its fount of profits to reduce the share count with buybacks. Thus, while Oracle’s total revenue has been growing at only a 3% rate, its revenue per share has been growing 10%. The analysis starts with 1,614 companies in the FactSet database that trade in the U.S., have market capitalizations over $1 billion and show revenue and shares outstanding numbers for at least 10 of the 12 years 2013-2024 (the last being a forecast). The long-term growth number is what comes out of an exponential fit to the revenue per share history. Predictability measures how closely that history tracks an exponential line (the statistician’s coefficient of determination), with a penalty for missing years. The top 10% of the group in predictability get the “Very High” label, the next 15% “High,” the next 15% “Above Average.” Among big companies with “Above Average” or better predictability, here are 20 standouts, with revenue per share growth between 22% and 58%: Not quite squeaking in are two names you expect to see: Amazon.com and Alphabet (i.e., Google). They both make the second ranking, however. This roster is limited to big companies with growth rates above 18% and Very High predictability: The final list is an assortment of revenue disappointments. It includes a woebegone utility (the former Pacific Gas & Electric), a good company in a shrinking industry (Artisan Partners, active management), a telephone company that wasn’t sure about diversifying into content (AT&T) and two greater-fool speculations (GameStop and AMC Entertainment). The revenue and share count statistics used as inputs come from FactSet, the price/earnings ratios from YCharts. Conclusions about growth rates are the author’s. The calculation uses a share count estimate for December 2024 that is an extrapolation of the recent trend in shares outstanding.

Nvidia Corp 's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Colette Kress, has made significant transactions in the company's stock, according to a recent filing. Kress sold a total of 59,670 shares with a value exceeding $7.7 million. The transactions occurred on September 20, 2024, under a pre-arranged trading plan. The sales were executed at weighted average prices ranging from $116.19 to $118.05. Specifically, Kress sold 45,510 shares at an average price of $116.19, with individual sales prices between $115.67 and $116.67. Another batch of 14,291 shares was sold at an average of $117.15, with prices ranging from $116.68 to $117.65. The final set of 6,869 shares was sold at an average price of $118.05, within a range of $117.68 to $118.52. These transactions follow a previous disposition of shares by Kress on September 18, where 68,609 shares were withheld by Nvidia to satisfy tax obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock units, valued at a price of $115.59 per share, totaling approximately $7.9 million. Following these transactions, Kress's direct holdings in Nvidia have been updated to 4,954,214 shares. Additionally, there are indirect holdings through a limited liability company connected to an irrevocable trust, totaling 767,680 shares, and smaller amounts held indirectly by immediate family members. Investors often monitor insider transactions for insights into executive sentiment on the company's prospects. The sales made by Nvidia's CFO were planned in advance, complying with SEC Rule 10b5-1, which allows company insiders to set up predetermined trading plans for buying or selling stock. In other recent news, OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, is in the middle of a significant funding round that could potentially raise its valuation to $150 billion, contingent upon a successful restructuring and the removal of a profit cap for investors. The funding round is expected to amass $6.5 billion and is attracting interest from existing investors such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Thrive Capital, and Khosla Ventures. New investors, including Nvidia and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), are also planning to join, with Sequoia Capital in discussions to return as an investor. Meanwhile, Nvidia's significant stock rally has contributed to around a quarter of the S&P 500's 17% rise this year, with the chipmaker's performance having a major influence on the market. The company's shares have also been the most actively traded in the options market on most days. In other developments, following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, U.S. stock index futures experienced a significant surge, with Nasdaq futures leading the gains. Tech giants such as Microsoft, Meta (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) each rose over 1.5%, and the semiconductor sector saw robust gains, with Nvidia up by 2.8%. Furthermore, market participants anticipate a further 25 basis point rate cut at the Fed's November meeting. As Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Colette Kress, engages in planned stock transactions, investors and analysts keep a close eye on the company's performance metrics and future outlook. According to InvestingPro, Nvidia boasts a perfect Piotroski Score of 9, indicating a very healthy financial state, which could instill confidence in the company's fiscal management and operational efficiency. Additionally, Nvidia is recognized for its impressive gross profit margins, a testament to its pricing power and cost management strategies. This financial metric is particularly relevant as it reflects the company's ability to translate sales into profits, an essential aspect for investors to consider following insider transactions. InvestingPro data also highlights that Nvidia is a prominent player in the Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment industry, which may influence the stock's appeal to investors seeking exposure to a leading company in a critical and growing sector of the technology market. For those seeking deeper insights and additional analysis, InvestingPro offers a comprehensive list of 21 tips for Nvidia, including sales growth anticipation, upward earnings revisions by analysts, and the company's performance in the market over various time frames.

Right now, you can score discounts on five women’s styles and six men’s styles, including 19% off our gear team’s pick for the best trail running shoe overall, the Hoka Speedgoat 5. You can save as much as 50% on a fresh pair of sneakers with this week's best Hoka deals. In addition to landing a spot on our list of the best trail running shoes, we also named a Hoka style one of the best shoes for standing all day. Whether you’re a walker, runner or simply looking for a colorful pair of sneakers to complement your athleisure, these are the best Hoka deals available right now. Hoka This sneaker is our gear team’s pick for the best trail running shoe overall. It’s comfortable with tons of cushion and lighter than the previous iteration. This discount is only available in three colorways, but a solid range of sizes. Hoka If you’re not sold on the Speedgoat 5, check out the Torrent 3, on sale for 20% off. The style is also designed for trail running, featuring a durable outsole, low-profile cushioning and neutral support. You can shop three colors at the moment, but sizing is limited. REI Avid hikers will appreciate this boot’s ample cushioning and Hubble heel design (for smoother heel-to-toe movement). The shoe is also waterproof and has a more streamlined aesthetic than your classic hiking boot. This discount is currently available in the color pictured above. Hoka We named the Hoka Arahi 7, which is designed to keep your feet from overpronating, the best cushioned sneaker for arch support (as well as the best stability running shoe for men). This discount is only available in the pictured colorway, but most sizes are still in stock. Dick's Sporting Goods Designed to balance cushion with a streamlined silhouette, this lightweight shoe is great for racing and daily runs. Four colors are currently on sale—some for even less—but the pictured colorway has the widest range of sizes available. Nordstrom You can find two colorways of the Mach 5 on sale for an impressive 44% off right now. (More colors are on sale for $112, if you don’t mind spending a bit more.)

The men’s Hoka Arahi 6 is currently on sale in three colorways, though the pictured combination has the widest selection of sizes. Dick's Sporting Goods The sneaker has a thick lug sole that’s extra grippy on the pavement and great for trail running. If you like the blue-and-yellow colorway above, it’s currently on sale for 25% off when you add the shoe to your cart. (This style is also on sale in two other colorways directly from Hoka for a slightly lesser discount. ) Nordstrom Rack Designed for racers, the Carbon X 3 has a meta-rocker sole for extra propulsion and a neutral, streamlined fit. This deal is currently available in two colors, both with a solid array of sizes to choose from. Hoka rarely offers sitewide sales. That said, its sale section is often stocked with older designs for as much as 40% off. You can also typically find deals on Hoka sneakers from third-party retailers like REI and Dick’s Sporting Goods. Yes, select Hoka styles have been awarded the podiatric APMA Seal of Acceptance. This means podiatrists have reviewed the shoes and agreed that a number of Hoka’s cushioned designs are beneficial to overall foot health. Our editors named the Hoka Clifton 9 sneaker the best cushioned walking shoe for women and the best men’s walking shoe for flat feet. The style is plush and supportive without feeling overly bulky. But they won’t work for everyone—the best walking shoe for you depends on a variety of factors, including how high your arches are and how you walk. For instance, we recommend skipping the Hoka Clifton 9 if you have especially narrow feet. The brand recommends replacing your Hokas between 250 and 500 miles, depending on individual wear. Pay attention to signs like increased muscle fatigue, uneven wear patterns and discomfort to identify when it’s time to trade in an older pair. Hokas have been popularized online for their outstanding comfort and support. They have a super-plush midsole that helps with shock absorption and stability without weighing you down. They also come in a variety of bright color combinations to suit most styles and preferences.

Title: Dave Vellante’s Breaking Analysis: The complete collection

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / SEPTEMBER 20 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO ofRelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries.

Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade.

Historical Performance Performance Since Inception to 30 June 2024 Sources: Middlefield, Bloomberg. As at 30 June 2024. Past performance is not a guide to the future. The price of investments and the income from them may fall as well as rise and investors may not get back the full amount invested. All price information is indicative only. Responsibility Statement We confirm that to the best of our knowledge: By order of the Board Michael Phair Andrew ZychowskiChairman Audit Committee Chair Date: 19 September 2024 Chairman’s Statement It is my pleasure to present the Half- Yearly Financial Report for the period ended 30 June, 2024 for Middlefield Canadian Income PCC (“MCT” or the “Company”) and its closed-ended cell, Middlefield Canadian Income – GBP PC (the “Fund”). The Fund invests primarily in dividend- paying Canadian equities, with the objective of providing shareholders with a high level of dividend as well as capital growth over the longer term. Investment Performance The Fund had good relative performance in the first half of 2024 (H1). It generated total returns of 4.6 per cent on its share price and 1.9 per cent on net assets, which are both higher than the benchmark total return of 0.3 per cent. Financials, Energy and Utilities were all positive contributors primarily due to sector allocation and stock selection gains. The Investment Manager believes that H1 represents the early stages of a sustained period of outperformance relative to the benchmark following a period of challenging market conditions for the Fund’s core sectors. The Board has regular contact with the Investment Manager, Middlefield Limited, to discuss broad strategy and review its investment approach, gearing and sector allocations. We remain satisfied that the Investment Manager is applying the strategy consistently and professionally and are confident that the Investment Manager’s outlook and the Fund’s corresponding positioning will deliver good performance over time. Investment Management Middlefield Limited, the Fund’s Investment Manager, has over 40 years of investing experience in the Canadian market. The Investment Manager uses an actively managed strategy, allowing it to take advantage of market dislocations. Given the high levels of cash flow and dividends that Canadian equities offer, and the valuation discounts at which they trade relative to U.S. companies, the Board remains supportive of the Investment Manager’s decision to maintain a significant geographic exposure to Canada. The ability to tactically overweight or underweight certain sectors as market dynamics evolve is an important element of the Fund’s active management strategy.Fund Sector Weights Compared to Benchmark as at 30 June 2024 Source: Middlefield, Bloomberg The background to the Fund’s performance is explained in depth by Mr Dean Orrico in the Investment Manager’s accompanying report. Share Rating and Buybacks The Fund’s share register continues to be supported by long-term institutional shareholders. In May 2024, the Fund’s lead portfolio managers, Dean Orrico and Rob Lauzon, met with many existing and prospective investors on a roadshow organized by Kepler Partners and Investec in London and surrounding regions. This included an exclusive event featuring the CEO of Enbridge Inc., a C$100 billion market capitalisation company and the Fund’s largest position. The Board also believes that enhancing the Fund’s profile with retail investors will increase demand for the stock. Towards this aim, the Investment Manager publishes comprehensive and insightful Fund monthly commentaries which are distributed to 700 existing and prospective investors, many of which have subscribed to these communications on MCT’s website. Direct retail investors are estimated to currently represent 24 per cent of the shareholder register, and the Investment Manager is focusing its efforts on growing that percentage over time. The Fund’s share price discount to NAV narrowed slightly from 16.8 per cent at 31 December 2023 to 15.0 per cent at 30 June 2024. Against a backdrop of a reducing interest rate environment and improving performance, the share price discount had further reduced to 12.4 per cent as at 18 September 2024. The Investment Manager and the Broker monitor the Fund’s share price and discount on a daily basis and the Board regularly considers the level of the Fund’s discount rating. Given the Fund’s positive performance year to date and the Investment Manager’s constructive outlook for the portfolio’s holdings for the rest of 2024 and beyond, the Company has since 28 August 2024 purchased for cash 40,000 Fund Shares, in aggregate to be held in treasury. In assessing whether to conduct buybacks, the Board will continue to consider the magnitude of the Fund’s share price discount and the benefits to shareholders that may be gained from the Company buying back its own shares, in conjunction with market factors, the discount ratings of comparable funds, and the size of the Company and the shrinkage in its asset base which necessarily results from the Company repurchasing its own shares. Gearing The Fund reports its gearing relative to net and total assets in its monthly fact sheet. Gearing relative to total assets was consistent throughout H1. This compares to the Fund’s upper limit of being able to borrow up to 25 per cent of its total assets at the time of drawdown. Net gearing, which represents borrowings as a percentage of net assets, is the AIC standard measure of gearing. Net gearing at the start of the year was 17.1 per cent and ended the period on 30 June 2024 at 18.3 per cent. The cost of borrowing has also come down in 2024. The Board continues to believe the use of gearing is warranted at prevailing interest rates due to an expected total return that exceeds total borrowing costs. The Board will continue to weigh the benefits of gearing against the associated risks and costs and monitors the spread between interest expenses and the yield of the portfolio to ensure the use of leverage remains in the best interests of shareholders. Earnings and Dividends In light of the excess earnings generated by the Fund in 2023, together with the prospect of dividend growth from the underlying portfolio, the Board approved a 0.1p increase in the annual dividend target in early 2024. Two quarterly interim dividends each of 1.325p per share were paid on 31 January 2024 and 30 April 2024, representing a 2% increase to quarterly payments made in the previous financial year. A further quarterly dividend of 1.325p was paid on 31 July post the half year end. Consistent dividend growth is a core consideration for the Fund’s security selection process and factored into the Board’s decision to increase the dividend. The Company’s revenue earnings per share totalled 2.80p for the six months ended 30 June 2024, reflecting a dividend coverage ratio of 1.06. This compares to dividend coverage ratios of 1.09 in 2023 and 1.16 in 2022. The dividend coverage ratio was impacted by a higher interest cost of borrowing which has started to reduce post the half year end with the Bank of Canada reducing interest rates. These figures are targets only and do not constitute, nor should they be interpreted as, a profit forecast. The Board regularly reviews the Fund’s dividend coverage and, subject to the legal requirements of the Companies’ Law, market conditions, as well as the Fund’s earnings, it will continue to consider whether further dividend increases are warranted in the future. Related Party Transactions The Company’s related parties are its directors and the Investment Manager. There were no related party transactions (as defined in the Listing Rules) during the year under review, nor up to the date of this report.Details of the remuneration paid to the directors and the Investment Manager during the period under review are shown in note 13. Material Events The Board is not aware of any significant event or transaction which occurred between 1 July 2024 and the date of publication of this statement which could have a material impact in the financial position of the Fund. Company and Fund Annual General Meetings At each of the Company and Fund’s Annual General Meetings held on 13 June 2024, all resolutions, relating to both ordinary business and special business, were duly passed on a poll. Board Composition and Succession Planning In keeping with the high standards of corporate governance, the Board regularly considers future succession. In recent years, we have experienced significant Board refreshment, with several retirements and new appointments.The Board now comprises five non-executive directors, of whom four are independent and 40% are female, including the senior independent director. Contact Shareholders can write to the Company at its registered office or by email to the Secretary at middlefield.cosec@jtcgroup.com. Principal Risks and Uncertainties Geopolitical tensions are high in several regions around the world, including Eastern Europe, the Middle East and the South China Sea. The war in Ukraine has been ongoing for more than two years and has resulted in Russia being isolated from a significant portion of the global economy. The war between Israel and Hamas, which started in October 2023, has the risk of spilling over into a broader conflict between Israel and its allies and Iranian-backed groups. The conflict has reached points of direct conflict between the two nations, including a situation where Iran fired over 300 missiles and drones directly at Israel for the first time in history. These actions resulted in direct retaliation by Israel against Iran and its proxies. These conflicts have the potential to further disrupt trade relationships, supply chains, capital flows and equity market behaviour. Considering U.S. Congress passed a $95 billion foreign aid package in April 2024, we do not expect any material de-escalation in the near-term. Although inflation has come down in recent months, it still remains above central bank targets in most regions. This has caused central banks to adopt restrictive monetary policies by raising the cost of borrowing and slowing the pace of bond purchases. While restrictive monetary policy helps to combat inflation, it could lead to risks and consequences if it is maintained for too long. These include a significant reduction in consumer spending, high unemployment, lower profit margins from higher borrowing costs and market volatility. Most central banks are expected to be finished hiking rates. There is, however, uncertainty as to the pace and timing of monetary easing. The Bank of Canada cut interest rates in June, July, and September 2024, causing its currency to depreciate relative to GBP and the U.S. dollar. While the subsequent rate cut by the European Central Bank and Bank of England in July partially mitigated the Canadian dollar’s depreciation, the initial impact of the Bank of Canada’s actions remains evident. Unsynchronized monetary policies from global central banks could lead to outsized movements in currencies as capital flows are typically attracted to countries with more restrictive policies. This can lead to supply/demand imbalances for government bonds and affect corporate earnings for companies with international operations. 2024 is an unusually busy year for elections. So far, new leaders have been elected in the U.K., Mexico, Iran and Pakistan while incumbent leaders in France and India have weakened positions of power in their respective countries. The United States will hold its Presidential election in November 2024, while Canada is expected to hold an election no later than October 2025. Election outcomes have the potential to inject uncertainty into the stock market. Regime change or shifts in the balance of power often lead to changes to government policies including tax reforms, trade agreements or foreign policy strategies. Managing Risks The Company’s risk assessment and the way in which significant risks are managed is an area of focus for the Board. Work here is driven by the Board’s assessment of the risks arising in the Company’s operations and identification and oversight of the controls exercised by the Board and its delegates, the Investment Manager and other service providers. These are recorded in the Company’s business risk matrix, which continues to serve as an effective tool to highlight and monitor the principal risks. The directors consider the principal risks of the Company to be those risks, or a combination thereof, that may materially threaten the Company’s ability to meet its investment objectives, its solvency, liquidity or viability. In assessing the principal risks, the directors considered the Company’s exposure to and likelihood of factors that they believe would result in significant erosion of value such as the impacts of climate change, a global recession, wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, higher borrowing costs, rebounding inflation, tightening credit conditions, fluctuating commodity prices and sharp moves in foreign exchange rates. At the time of this report, inflation, higher interest rates and fluctuating foreign exchange rates are impacting the Company and its investments. While the long-term severity and impact on the Company’s principal risks cannot currently be predicted with any accuracy, it is expected that an extended period of restrictive monetary policy would have detrimental lagged effects. Outlook With the Bank of Canada officially entering a cycle of policy easing on 5 June, 24 July, and 4 September, we are optimistic that the relative performance of Canadian equities will improve in the second half of the year. Several of the Fund’s core sector exposures, including Real Estate, Utilities, Pipelines and Financials, are poised to benefit from lower interest rates. As of early September, markets are pricing an additional two interest rate cuts from the BoC before the end of 2024, which should serve as a powerful tailwind for margins in these sectors. More importantly, as long as we avoid a severe economic slowdown, we believe falling rates should boost investor sentiment in these areas and result in capital flows returning to dividend-paying equities in Canada. The country’s population has grown by more than 8 per cent. since before the pandemic, resulting in the highest population growth of any developed nation in the world. This should continue to support robust consumer spending and opportunities for growth in domestic end-markets. Canada is also a global leader in responsible energy production, led by several world-renowned energy producers and infrastructure companies. The Investment Manager believes that oil, gas, and other commodities produced in Canada will have firm price support over the coming years – especially if geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe and the Middle East do not de-escalate soon. Canadian companies in the Energy and Materials sectors have accrued decades of technical expertise and operate their businesses under global best-practices, offering unique, high-quality exposure to resources. Despite having similar expected earnings growth over the next two years, Canadian equities are trading at an unprecedented valuation discount to U.S. stocks. With a dividend yield of more than 5 per cent, the Fund also provides a stable and growing stream of income to investors in the form of quarterly distributions. We believe the current valuation discount embedded in Canadian equities offers a compelling entry point into high-quality Canadian companies. We continue to advocate that U.K. investors seeking North American equity exposure should allocate capital to Canada. The Board joins me in thanking you for your continued support. Michael Phair Chairman 19 September 2024 Middlefield Group is a private and independent asset manager focused on equity income investment strategies. Located in Toronto, Canada, the company oversees a suite of funds, many of which have been recognised for excellence in various investment categories. Middlefield specialises in managing diversified equity income strategies for UK and Canadian investors with a particular focus on delivering stable distributions and capital appreciation over the long term. Investment Manager’s Interim Report The continued momentum in stocks linked to A.I. led to robust market returns during the first half of 2024 (H1). In the U.S., market leadership was extremely narrow, with Index heavyweights Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, Google, Amazon, and Meta contributing 62 per cent of the S&P’s 16.4 per cent total return (British Pounds). The TSX Composite Index lagged the S&P 500 in H1 due to its lower exposure to technology stocks and greater weighting to cyclical and value sectors. Even so, Canadian equities generated a respectable total return of 3.4 per cent in British Pounds and an above-average return of 6.1 per cent in Canadian dollars. The rally in technology stocks has lifted the forward price-to-earnings multiple on the S&P 500 to 23x – an 8-point premium to the TSX Composite. This represents the largest valuation gap between the two country’s indices in 25 years and, in our opinion, an extremely attractive entry point in Canadian equities. This comes at a time where future earnings growth between the two benchmarks is comparable. The TSX is expected to generate earnings growth of 13.8 per cent in 2025 and another 7.4 per cent in 2026 which compares to 13.5 per cent and 8.2 per cent for the S&P 500. Put simply, Canadian equities currently offer similar earnings growth versus U.S. stocks while trading at an unprecedented valuation discount. Although the earnings growth rate for the TSX High Dividend Index is expected to be lower than for the TSX Composite at 8.2% and 4.7% respectively the valuation gap to the S&P 500 is even greater with a 9-point gap in the forward price-to-earnings multiple. We expect lower interest rates to be a catalyst in narrowing the valuation discount in Canadian equities. The Bank of Canada (BoC) officially initiated its first easing cycle in four years with a cut to the overnight policy rate on 5 June, followed by further cuts on 24 July and 4 September. Markets are currently pricing an additional 2 cuts from the BoC over the next six months. Historically, the TSX has averaged double-digit gains twelve months after the first BoC rate cut. We believe core defensive yield sectors including utilities, telecommunications and real estate are particularly well-positioned to outperform against a falling rate backdrop. A common theme that emerged in economic data throughout H1 was normalisation. Growth expectations, inflation, and employment statistics have all been easing from abnormally high levels in recent months. We view this trend positively as long as the pace of easing remains gradual, as we expect. Although the Canadian dollar depreciated against the British Pound in H1, we anticipate this pressure to ease in the coming months. We are not forecasting a recession in the U.S. or Canada over the next twelve months and believe the evolving macro landscape is conducive to continued strong performance from North American equity markets. Canada’s population has increased 8 per cent since before the pandemic. While there are many Canadian companies that will benefit from such a rapid increase in domestic demand, we believe Real Estate is among the biggest beneficiaries. Supply of real estate has not kept pace with the surge in demand, causing Canada’s per capita housing stock and shopping centre space to fall by 2 per cent and 6 per cent respectively over this period. As a result, rents have increased while vacancy rates have fallen to historic lows within these asset classes. Apartment rents have risen close to 10 per cent year-over-year while retail property leasing spreads are currently exceeding 10 per cent. The operating environment is as attractive as it has ever been for these real estate sectors and, when investor focus finally shifts away from the headwind of rising interest rates, we expect a swift re-rating in REIT unit prices. Real Estate remains the Fund’s largest active sector weight relative to the Benchmark. The Fund’s core real estate exposure areas include necessity-based retail, apartments, industrial, and seniors housing. We maintain a positive outlook on Canadian energy stocks. As at 30 June 2024, the Fund had 17.6 per cent of its portfolio allocated to Canadian energy producers, 2.7 per cent above the Benchmark weighting. Energy producers should benefit from stable commodity prices in H2, supported by attractive supply/demand fundamentals and geopolitical tailwinds. They are also poised to get a boost to pricing from additions to export capacity. LNG Canada, the largest private infrastructure project in Canada’s history, will become operational in 2025. With an export capacity of 1.8 Bcf/d, Canadian gas producers will benefit from a material boost to production egress and be able to access global markets. Oil producers are also getting a lift from the recently completed Trans Mountain Pipeline project (TMX), which added 590,000 barrels of crude oil capacity per day. The Canada Energy Regulator estimates that the added capacity will add approximately $9 per barrel to what Canadian producers currently receive. Both projects will stimulate robust production and cash flow growth for Canadian energy companies which should lead to increased share buybacks, dividends and special distributions to shareholders. Canadian Natural Resources is our preferred oil-weighted producer and Tourmaline is our favourite company for natural gas exposure. We hold an equally positive view on Canadian energy infrastructure companies (i.e., pipelines) and are overweight the Benchmark by 1.4p ercentage points. Both LNG Canada and the TMX pipeline are expected to stimulate multi-billion-dollar investments from energy producers and will require a significant build-out of energy infrastructure to connect increasing production to this new infrastructure. Looking beyond Western Canada, natural gas will serve a key role in powering new data centres and fuel the surging electricity demand from corporations. Pipeline companies will play a critical role in gathering, processing and transporting natural gas volumes throughout North America to LNG export terminals. Enbridge, TC Energy and Pembina Pipeline are three core holdings that have exposure to both Canadian and US energy basins and are well-positioned for the upcoming capital expenditure cycle. Financials represented 25.0 per cent of the portfolio at the end of H1 – the largest sector weight in the portfolio. With rebounding capital markets activity and increased focus on cost-cutting, the sector returned 5.3 per cent in H1. Canada-centric banks have outperformed those with significant U.S. exposure recently, mainly due to idiosyncratic reasons, and we have re-positioned our exposure to banks accordingly. The regulatory environment in Canada is also supportive of the banks’ capital ratios, with OSFI maintaining the Domestic Stability Buffer. The Fund has been diversifying its exposure to financials by adding insurance companies and asset managers to the portfolio. These positions will expose the Fund to more profitable segments and geographies as broad-based equity markets reach all-time highs. As fund flows continue to improve, we maintain a positive outlook for Canadian asset managers in the second half of the year. The Fund had 11.1 per cent of the portfolio allocated to the utilities sector at the end of H1, below the Benchmark weight of 13.9 per cent. This underweight positioning was additive to performance in H1, with utilities having the second highest attribution during the period behind communication services, which was also underweight. After facing a series of challenges in 2023, including cost overruns and project delays, the utilities sector continued to lag the TSX index with a total return of -1.1 per cent in H1. Despite these past challenges, the surging demand for electricity to power new data centres is a trend that has caused us to take a more positive stance on the sector. We remain bullish on the sector’s long-term growth prospects and expect upcoming rate cuts to help improve sentiment for this sector. Our preferred picks include Capital Power, AltaGas and Emera. Top Holdings Top Holdings as at 30 June, 2024 Outlook We believe cyclical and value sectors are poised to outperform in H2. The A.I. theme has lifted valuations in technology and communication services sectors, presenting little opportunity for further multiple expansion. This has resulted in the largest valuation discount between the TSX Composite and S&P500 in over 25 years. We believe the Fund’s core exposures within real estate, financials, and energy should benefit once capital flows out of high-multiple growth sectors and money market funds into more reasonably priced areas of the market. As a result, we feel Canadian companies currently offer better risk-adjusted returns at a cheaper valuation compared to their US peers. The Bank of Canada has shifted towards an easing monetary policy, and we expect sentiment to improve for rate sensitive sectors. Despite being out of favour, fundamentals in these areas are attractive and support sustainable earnings growth. Canadian REITs continue to benefit from a structural demand/ supply imbalance which will drive consistent rent growth for many years to come. The build- out of the A.I. industry will require significant additional energy capacity to power data centres and provide growth opportunities within the utilities and pipeline sectors. We believe there is significant upside in many of these companies once investors are less focused on rates and more on company fundamentals. Canadian corporations have returned record amounts of capital to shareholders recently in the form of dividends and share buybacks, which is a trend we expect to continue. The Fund is focused on high-quality companies with visibility into free cash flow and dividend growth. MCT’s portfolio emphasises high dividend paying stocks which have a long track record of consistently increasing dividends. Over the past five years dividends received by the Fund’s portfolio have increased by 7.8% per annum, exceeding the 7.2% per annum growth rate for the Benchmark. Middlefield Limited ESG Environment, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Policy and Stewardship Principles: ESG Policy As Investment Manager, Middlefield Limited (“Middlefield”) has a duty to maximise investment returns for the shareholders of the Fund, without undue risk of loss. Middlefield does this within the investment limits of the Fund’s investment mandate. Although the Fund is not an ESG-focused or sustainable fund, Middlefield incorporates ESG considerations into its investment process to aid decision making, identify potential risks and opportunities and to enhance long-term, risk-adjusted returns. Stephen Erlichman, one of the foremost experts on governance in Canada, serves as Chair, ESG for Middlefield to augment its ESG capabilities and processes. It is Middlefield’s responsibility to employ a disciplined investment process that seeks to identify attractive investment opportunities and evaluate material risks that could impact portfolio returns. Middlefield believes that ESG factors have become an important component of a thorough investment analysis and that the integration of ESG factors will result in a more comprehensive understanding of a company’s strategy, culture, and sustainability. Consistent with these objectives, Middlefield integrates ESG considerations into its investment process and these considerations are significant factors in selecting portfolio companies for its ESG-focused mandates. Our current ESG integration process includes the following: Many countries have established or are in the process of establishing standardised ESG disclosure requirements for corporate issuers. When enacted, these are expected to enhance the efficiency of the ongoing review and monitoring of a company’s ESG practices. Middlefield’s approach to ESG integration may evolve over time as more ESG and sustainability research and data become available. In addition to Middlefield’s integration of ESG considerations into its investment process, Middlefield has adopted Stewardship Principles and activities as set out below which are complementary to its ESG integration process. Middlefield’s Stewardship Principles Middlefield, as a Canadian asset manager, understands it has the responsibility to be an effective steward of the assets it manages for its clients in order to enhance the value of those assets for the benefit of its clients. The Canadian Coalition for Good Governance (“CCGG”) has published a set of seven stewardship principles, which have become recognised as Canada’s stewardship code for institutional asset owners and asset managers. Middlefield believes that CCGG’s stewardship principles should be tailored for asset managers depending on various factors, such as the size of the asset manager and the type of assets managed. Set out below are CCGG’s seven stewardship principles and a description of how Middlefield, as an independent Canadian asset manager whose predominant assets are public and private investment funds that invest in Canadian and international equities, carries out or intends to carry out such principles. Principle 1. Develop an approach to stewardship: Institutional investors should develop, implement, and disclose their approach to stewardship and how they meet their stewardship responsibilities. Middlefield integrates stewardship into its investment process. Such integration includes: Principle 2. Monitor companies: Institutional Investors should monitor the companies in which they invest. Middlefield monitors the companies in which it invests, including as follows: Principle 3. Report on voting activities: Institutional investors should adopt and publicly disclose their proxy voting guidelines and how they exercise voting rights. Middlefield exercises voting rights attached to the securities held by the funds it manages as follows: A. proxies will be voted in a manner that seeks to enhance the long-term sustainable value of the funds it manages; and B. proxies will be voted in a manner consistent with leading Canadian and international corporate governance practices. In addition, the public funds managed by Middlefield follow the proxy voting requirements of Part 10 of National Instrument 81-106 in regard to establishing policies and procedures for proxy voting and in regard to preparing and disclosing their proxy voting records. Principle 4. Engage with companies: Institutional investors should engage with portfolio companies. Middlefield engages with portfolio companies as follows: Principle 5. Collaborate with other institutional investors: Institutional investors should collaborate with other institutional investors where appropriate. Middlefield collaborates with other institutional investors through investor associations to which Middlefield belongs such as the Responsible Investment Association (RIA). Principle 6. Work with policy makers: Institutional investors should engage with regulators and other policy makers where appropriate. Middlefield’s professional advisors, such as the law firms and accounting firms it retains, assist to keep it up to date on developments that are material to it as an asset manager. It utilises its professional advisors, and it also relies on the organisations to which it belongs, to engage on its behalf with regulators and policy makers where appropriate. Principle 7. Focus on long-term sustainable value: Institutional investors should focus on promoting the creation of long-term sustainable value. Middlefield focuses on a portfolio company’s long-term success and sustainable value creation, including as follows: ESG Case Studies Manulife (Top 25% ESG ranking and 4.0% of the portfolio as at 30 June 2024) Summary: Manulife Financial is a leading insurance provider in Canada’s financial sector. Offering a comprehensive range of financial solutions, the company operates through a widespread network and digital platforms. With a focus on insurance, wealth management, and investments, Manulife’s commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction cements its prominent position in the global financial landscape.

New standards and interpretations not yet effective and have not been adopted early by the Company There are no other standards, interpretations or amendments to existing standards that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a signiﬁcant impact on the Company. b. Going concern In the opinion of the directors, there is a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Fund have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, the interim ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. The directors have arrived at this opinion by considering, inter alia, the following factors: 3. Securities (at fair value through profit and loss) Please refer to Note 18 for the Schedule of Investments. 4. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held by the Fund and bank balances with an original maturity of three months or less. The carrying value of these assets approximates their fair value. 5. Other payables and accruals 6. Stated capitalThe authorised share capital of the Fund is split into two management shares of no par value and an unlimited number of redeemable participating preference shares of no par value, the latter of which are attributable solely to the Fund. The holders of redeemable participating preference shares are entitled to receive in proportion to their holdings, all of the revenue proﬁts of the Fund (including accumulated revenue reserves). Each redeemable participating preference shareholder is entitled to one vote for each share held, provided all amounts payable in respect of that share have been paid. Management shares are non-redeemable, have no right in respect of the accrued entitlement, and have no right to participate in the assets of the Fund on a winding-up. In all other respects, the management shares have the same rights and restrictions as redeemable participating preference shares. Each management share entitles the holder to one vote for each share held. Redeemable participating preference shares are redeemed at the absolute discretion of the directors. Since redemption is at the discretion of the directors, in accordance with the provisions of IAS 32, the redeemable participating preference shares are classiﬁed as equity. The Fund will not give effect to redemption requests in respect of more than 25 per cent. of the shares then in issue, or such lesser percentage as the directors may decide. At the period end, there were 18,195,000 (30 June 2023: 18,195,000, 31 December 2023: 18,195,000) treasury shares in issue. Treasury shares have no value and no voting rights. FCA regulation of ‘non-mainstream pooled investments’ On 1 January 2014, the FCA introduced rules relating to the restrictions on the retail distribution of unregulated collective investment schemes and close substitutes (non-mainstream pooled investments). UK investment trusts are excluded from these restrictions, as are other “excluded securities” as deﬁned by the FCA. As reported in last year’s annual report, the Board believes that the Company’s shares are “excluded securities” under the FCA’s deﬁnitions of such and, as a result, the FCA’s restrictions on retail distribution do not apply. This status is reviewed annually and the Board intends to conduct the Company’s affairs to retain such status for the foreseeable future. Retained Earnings This reserve records all net gains and losses and transactions with owners not recorded elsewhere. This reserve is available for distribution to the shareholders. Dividends paid to shareholders are recognised directly in this reserve. 7. Net asset value per redeemable participating preference shareThe net asset value per share of 121.22p (30 June 2023: 121.63p, 31 December 2023: 121.55p) is based on the net assets at the period end of £129,081,580 (30 June 2023: £129,522,522, 31 December 2023: £129,439,090) and on 106,487,250 redeemable participating preference shares, being the number of redeemable participating preference shares in issue (excluding shares held in treasury) at the period end (30 June 2023: 106,487,250 shares, 31 December 2023: 106,487,250 shares). 8. Dividend and interest income 9. Net movement in the fair value of securities 10. Profit/(loss) per redeemable participating preference share – basic and dilutedBasic proﬁt/(loss) per redeemable participating preference share is calculated by dividing the net proﬁt attributable to redeemable participating preference shares of £2,464,402 (30 June 2023: £4,344,825 loss, 31 December 2023: £1,659,589 loss) by the weighted average number of redeemable participating preference shares outstanding during the period of 106,487,250 shares (30 June 2023: 106,487,250, 31 December 2023: 106,487,250 shares). The allocation between revenue and capital can be found on the Statement of Comprehensive Income of the Fund on page 27. 11. DividendsDividends of 1.325 pence per share were paid on a quarterly basis during the year in the months of January and April £2,821,912 (30 June 2023: £2,768,669, 31 December 2023: £5,537,337) for the year. On 31 July 2024 a dividend of £1,410,956 was paid at 1.325 pence per share. In accordance with the requirements of IFRS, as this was approved on4 July 2024, being after the reporting date, no accrual was reﬂected in the 2024 Interim Financial Statements for this amount of £1,410,956 (6 July 2023: £1,384,334). 12. TaxationThe Fund is subject to UK corporation tax at a rate of 19% (2023: 19%). The Company adopted UK tax residency on11 October 2011. Since that date the Company has been managed in such a way as to be able to meet the conditions for approval as an investment trust under Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010. As an investment trust, all capital gains are exempt from UK corporation tax. On 7 December 2012, the Company received approval from HM Revenue & Customs to be treated as an investment trust in accordance with Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 and will seek to remain so approved. 13.

Loan payableThe Fund has a Credit Facility Agreement with RBC whereby RBC provides the Credit Facility, with a maximum principal amount of the lesser of CAD 75,000,000 and 25 per cent. of the total asset value of the Fund. The credit facility was amended on 3 April, 2024 to replace Banker’s Acceptances with CORRA (Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average). At 30 June 2024, the amount drawn down under the Credit Facility was CAD 46,500,000 (GBP equivalent at amortised cost of £26,882,228) (period ended 30 June 2023: CAD 48,000,000 (GBP equivalent at amortised cost of £28,286,013), 31 December 2023: CAD 37,000,000 (GBP equivalent at amortised cost of £21,831,966)). The loan value of CAD 46,500,000 was made up of four Term CORRA loans as follows: As at 30 June 2024, the interest paid on the Banker’s Acceptance and Term CORRA loans totalled £768,265 (period ended 30 June 2023: £749,445, 31 December 2023: £1,388,175) with £76,953 accrued at period end. As at 30 June 2023, pre-paid interest and stamping fees of £122,328 (year ended 31 December 2023: £43,075) were paid on the Banker’s Acceptance. Prime Loans, the Prime Rate minus 0.35 per cent. In the case of Term CORRA loan, a stamping fee of 0.60 per cent. per annum is payable. 15. Security agreementIn connection with entry into the Credit Facility Agreement, the Fund has entered into a general security agreement with RBC, pursuant to which the Fund has granted RBC interests in respect of collateral, being all present and future personal property, including the securities portfolio, as security for the Fund’s obligations under the Credit Facility Agreement. 16. Financial instrumentsFair values The carrying amounts of the investments, accrued income, other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loan payable and other payables approximate their fair values. In 2015, the percentage of the value of portfolio assets which may be invested in securities listed on a recognised stock exchange outside Canada was increased to up to 40 per cent. Management of capital The Investment Manager manages the capital of the Fund in accordance with the Fund’s Investment Objectives and Policy. The capital structure of the Fund consists of proceeds from the issue of preference shares, loans and reserve accounts. The Investment Manager manages and adjusts its capital in response to general economic conditions, the risk characteristics of the underlying assets and working capital requirements. Generally speaking, the Fund will reduce leverage when investments are likely to decrease in value and will increase leverage when investment appreciation is anticipated. In order to maintain or adjust its capital structure, the Fund may borrow or repay debt under its Credit Facility or undertake other activities deemed appropriate under the speciﬁc circumstances. The Fund and the Company do not have any externally imposed capital requirements. However, the Fund is subject to bank covenants in respect of leverage and complied with those covenants for the whole of both 2024 and 2023. Investment and trading activities It is intended that the Fund will continue throughout its life to be primarily invested in Canadian and U.S. equities portfolio. The Fund’s investing activities expose it to various types of risk that are associated with the ﬁnancial instruments and markets in which it invests. The most important types of ﬁnancial risk to which the Fund is exposed are market price risk, interest rate risk and currency risk. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or counterparty may be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the Fund. The Fund’s principal ﬁnancial assets are bank balances and cash, other receivables and investments as set out in the Statement of Financial Position which represents the Fund’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to the ﬁnancial assets. The credit risk on bank balances is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings of A, AA- and A+ assigned by Standard and Poor’s rating agency. All transactions in listed securities are settled upon delivery using approved brokers. The risk of default is considered minimal as delivery of securities sold is only made once the broker has received payment. Payment is made on a purchase once the securities have been received by the broker. The trade will fail if either party fails to meet its obligations. Where the Investment Manager makes an investment in debt or corporate securities, the credit rating of the issuer is taken into account to manage the Company’s exposure to risk of default. Investments in debt or corporate securities are across a variety of sectors and geographical markets, to avoid concentration of credit risk. The Fund’s maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying value of the assets on the Statement of Financial Position. Market price risk Market price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash ﬂows of a ﬁnancial instrument will ﬂuctuate because of changes in market prices (other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk), whether those changes are caused by factors speciﬁc to the individual ﬁnancial instrument or its issuer, or factors affecting similar ﬁnancial instruments traded in the market. The Fund’s exposure to market price risk is comprised mainly of movements in the value of the Fund’s investments. It is the business of the Investment Manager to manage the portfolio and borrowings to achieve the best returns. The directors manage the risk inherent in the portfolio by monitoring, on a formal basis, the Investment Manager’s compliance with the Company’s stated Investment Policy and reviewing investment performance. Country risk On 17 January 2012, the FRC released “Responding to the increased country and currency risk in ﬁnancial reports”. This update from the FRC included guidance on responding to the increased country and currency risk as a result of funding pressures on certain European countries, the curtailment of capital spending programmes (austerity measures) and regime changes in the Middle East. The Fund invests primarily in Canadian and U.S. securities. The Investment Manager monitors the Company’s exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis. The Board has reviewed the disclosures and believes that no additional disclosures are required because the Canadian and U.S. economies are stable. Fair value measurements IFRS 13 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritises the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 13 are as follows: The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is signiﬁcant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. For this purpose, the signiﬁcance of an input is assessed against the fair value measurement in its entirety. If a fair value measurement uses observable inputs that require signiﬁcant adjustment based on unobservable inputs, that measurement is a level 3 measurement. Assessing the signiﬁcance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, considering factors speciﬁc to the asset or liability. The determination of what constitutes ‘observable’ requires signiﬁcant judgment by the directors. The directors consider observable data to be that market data that is readily available, regularly distributed or updated, reliable and veriﬁable, not proprietary, and provided by independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant market. The following tables present the Fund’s ﬁnancial instruments by level within the valuation hierarchy as of 30 June 2024, 30 June 2023 and 31 December 2023: The Fund holds securities that are traded in active markets. Such ﬁnancial instruments are classiﬁed as Level 1 of the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy. There were no transfers between Level 1, 2 and 3 in the year. Price sensitivity At 30 June 2024, if the market prices of the securities had been 30% higher with all other variables held constant, the increase in net assets attributable to holders of redeemable participating preference shares for the year would have been £45,701,609 (30 June 2023: £46,709,619, 31 December 2023: £43,993,051) higher, arising due to the increase in the fair value of ﬁnancial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss. At 30 June 2024, if the market prices of the securities had been 30% lower with all other variables held constant, the decrease in net assets attributable to holders of redeemable shares for the year would have been equal, but opposite, to the ﬁgures stated above. Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash ﬂows of a ﬁnancial instrument will ﬂuctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Fund’s interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities mainly comprise cash and cash equivalents, debt securities and loan payable. The cash and cash equivalents are subject to ﬂoating rates and are considered to be part of the investment strategy of the Fund. No other hedging is undertaken in respect of this interest rate risk. There were no ﬁxed rate assets or liabilities at 30 June 2024, 30 June 2023 and 31 December 2023. The following table details the Fund’s exposure to interest rate risk at 30 June 2024, 30 June 2023 and 31 December 2023: * Interest on bank balances is not material to the ﬁnancial statements and are based on prevailing bank base rates. The above analysis excludes short-term debtors and creditors as all material amounts are non-interest bearing. Interest rate sensitivity analysis At 30 June 2024, had interest rates been 50 basis points higher and all other variables were held constant, the Company’s net assets attributable to redeemable participating preference shares for the year would have decreased by £117,526 (30 June 2023: £131,622, 31 December 2023: £86,994) due to an increase in interest payable on the loan and to a lesser extent an increase in interest earnings on cash and cash equivalents. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Fund cannot meet its liabilities as they fall due. The Fund’s primary source of liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents, securities at fair value through proﬁt or loss and the Credit Facility. The Fund’s investments are considered to be readily realisable, predominantly issued by Canadian and U.S. companies and REITs listed on a Canadian Stock Exchange, and actively traded. As at 30 June 2024, the Fund’s ability to manage liquidity risk was as follows: As at 30 June 2023, the Fund’s ability to manage liquidity risk was as follows: As at 31 December 2023, the Fund’s ability to manage liquidity risk was as follows: Currency risk The Fund is denominated in GBP, whereas the Fund’s principal investments are denominated in CAD and USD. Consequently, the Fund is exposed to currency risk. The Fund’s policy is therefore to actively monitor exposure to currency risk. The Board reserves the right to employ currency hedging but, other than in exceptional circumstances, does not intend to hedge. The Board considers that exposure was signiﬁcant at the year end. The Fund’s net exposure to CAD currency at the year end was as follows: The Fund’s net exposure to USD currency at the year end was as follows: Sensitivity analysis At 30 June 2024, had GBP strengthened against the CAD by 5%, with all other variables held constant, the decrease in net assets attributable to shareholders would amount to approximately £6,297,937 (30 June 2023: £6,477,374, 31 December 2023: £6,478,328). Had GBP weakened against the CAD by 5%, this would amount to an increase in net assets attributable to shareholders of approximately £6,297,937 (30 June 2023: £6,477,374, 31 December 2023: £6,478,328). At 30 June 2024, had GBP strengthened against the USD by 5%, with all other variables held constant, the decrease in net assets attributable to shareholders would amount to approximately £148,549 (30 June 2023: £8,921, 31 December 2023: £4,135). Had GBP weakened against the USD by 5%, this would amount to an increase in net assets attributable to shareholders of approximately £148,549 (30 June 2023: £8,921, 31 December 2023: £4,135). 17.

Title: Moore: Biden & Harris tech policy puts America last

The Wall Street Journal noted last week that American shareholders will lose tens of billions of dollars in investment income from their stock holdings in Silicon Valley companies like Google and Apple if several European Union sham lawsuits prevail.The EU’s courts outrageously ruled this week that Apple shareholders owe Europe 13.5 billion euros in back taxes because the company took advantage of Ireland’s low 12.5% tax rate. The EU “competition chief” declared that this sham court decision “is a big win for European citizens and tax justice.” No, it’s a big win for big government.Google shareholders are now forced to pay the EU $2.7 billion because its search engine has become dominant in the European market. The European search engines are so inferior that nobody wants to use them. So, sue American companies.Let’s be clear here: The EU laggards are simply green with envy. The Eurozone has been crushed by American tech dominance. No company in socialist Europe has found a way to compete with American innovation at Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta and so on. Since they can’t compete, they invent sore-loser lawsuits.The bigger issue is why the Biden administration isn’t defending American companies from European extortion. These tech lawsuits are a tax on American knowhow and innovation. Instead of defending American shareholders from the EU predators, the Biden regulators give legitimacy to the foreign courts. How can the U.S. government complain against specious antitrust attacks against Google and Apple when our own regulators at the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department are bringing copycat lawsuits against our tech giants in U.S. courts?The capricious fine against Google is a result of an American company shopping around the globe to find the lowest tax climate (Ireland) for doing business. This is illegal? Our corporate tax rate thanks to the Trump tax cut is now 21%, down from 35% under former President Barack Obama. But President Joe Biden and now presidential candidate Kamala Harris want to raise it back up to 28% or more. That only encourages more jobs and investment to move offshore. Did I mention that Ireland’s rate is just 12.5%?Instead of lowering the rates here, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen wants to force Ireland and other low-tax countries to raise their rates to a global minimum tax of 15% or more.Similarly, antitrust lawsuits from Europe and Washington aimed at American tech companies are spurious because nearly every price for tech services — from cellphones to drone deliveries to internet searches to fiber optic hookups — has been falling. How are consumers getting gouged if they keep paying less? I often don’t like the politics of Big Tech. But the end result of what Washington is doing to penalize American tech giants for building a better mousetrap is to move the high-tech hubs of the world — from Silicon Valley to Austin to Boston to Miami — to competitor nations. That’s a good way to lose jobs and put America last.Stephen Moore is a cofounder of Unleash Prosperity. He is also an economic advisor to the Trump campaign.

Abhishek Banerjee, smallcase Manager and Founder at Lotusdew: “Nifty has dislodged China as the largest country in MSCI EM and is hitting all-time highs with 2 active wars.

While India’s account deficit is also hitting all time high, we are sitting on highest forex reserves too.

TBO Tek stock trades flat on the NSE at ₹1,741.30. Why the stock market is rising today, here is the view from Palka Arora Chopra, Director, Master Capital Services Ltd: The current upswing in the stock market results from market forecasts of increased foreign inflows into India following the Fed rate decrease, combined with the fact that US Jobless Claims are at their lowest point since May 2024 alleviating concerns about the US market’s slowdown. Overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Averages and S&P 500 index surged to 1.7%. Asia saw a rise in markets in Korea, Japan, and Hong Kong. Domestic stocks followed the global rally’s path. The US labor market is not failing; rather, it is simply slowing down, according to the good labour market data released recently. Since inflation is under control, a scenario with declining interest rates calls for a soft landing for the US. This is good news for the world’s equity markets. Yes Bank has received an Order from the Income-tax Department, at 2:19 PM on September 19, 2024, imposing penalty amounting to Rs. 10,000/- for delayed submission of information called for u/s 143(2) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“the Act”) for Assessment Year 2018-19 Shares trade flat on the NSE at ₹22.99 1. ⁠Cosmic CRF: ORDER Subsidiary of Company has bagged order worth INR 127 Cr for supply of Cold Formed Steel Sheet Piles within 1 Year. 2.

Sensex and Nifty 50 jumped 1% to hit all-time highs. What is driving the Indian stock market, here is the view from Santosh Meena, Head of Research, Swastika Investmart Ltd: The Indian markets are rallying today, driven by strong global cues. Historically, emerging markets tend to outperform during the onset of a rate-cut cycle in the U.S., especially when coupled with a decline in the dollar index and U.S. bond yields. Indian markets, backed by robust fundamentals, remain resilient despite concerns over valuations. Large-cap stocks, particularly in the private banking sector, continue to look attractive, fueling the current bullish momentum. However, there is noticeable underperformance in the broader market. This positive trend is expected to persist unless significant negative developments arise on the domestic or global front.

Gold prices steadied near record highs on Friday and were poised for a weekly gain, as markets adjusted to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s recent super-sized interest rate reduction and signs that further cuts were on the horizon. Spot gold held its ground at $2,586.98 per ounce, and has climbed about 0.4% for the week so far. - Reuters Indian capital and equity markets were largely unaffected on Thursday following a half-point rate cut by the US Federal Reserve, the first in over four years. Equities, gold and bond prices rose only marginally as investors had already priced in the rate cut. This is in contrast to the global financial markets which saw stocks and gold hitting new highs.

Here’s an interesting stock idea: The stock that we have today is CCL Products. It has bounced off a support this week and looks to rally further. Supporting this, the broader trend is positive, and the price action is bullish. Here are the intraday supports and resistances for widely traded stocks such as Reliance Industries, ITC, ONGC, Infosys, HDFC Bank, TCS, and SBI The stock of CCL Products (India) saw a price decline over the past couple of weeks. After touching a record high of ₹854 in early September, the scrip started to drop. However, the overall uptrend remains valid, and the stock has appreciated so far this week. The chart shows that it has rebounded from support and that further gains are likely from here. We anticipate the stock to rise to ₹830 in the short term.
