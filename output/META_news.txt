Title: AI Won’t Replace Jobs, but Tech Bros Want You to Be Afraid It Will

reading time 5 minutes AI is overrated, according to author Cory Doctorow. “I don’t think AI can do your job,” Doctorow said, but despite that, bosses across industries are “insatiably horny” about the idea that AI will replace jobs. Top of the list is tech bosses. Tech is one of the industries where AI is scaling significantly faster in the workforce than average (the bigger picture corporate AI adoption is much slower, and some studies claim the returns on investments are low). Many tech CEOs have made statements expressing their wishes to automate tasks that would have regularly gone to human workers. A new report by Source, a consulting firm that works with the tech industry, claimed that over half of tech companies are considering restructuring because of AI. “Tech bosses love the story of AI replacing programmers,” Doctorow said at an event hosted by the Brooklyn Public Library last week, where he was answering former FTC chair Lina Khan’s questions. During her tenure in the Biden administration, Khan was known for her firm regulatory stance against big tech monopolies. Computer programming was once the most lucrative industry to go into, with a surplus of demand for workers; there were numerous job opportunities with great pay and benefits, and cushy amenities. Now, the script has completely switched. Many have blamed the rise of generative AI for it. But Doctorow argues “that’s just not a thing AI is doing” or even can do. “AI can write sub-routines, it can’t do software architecture. Can’t do engineering, because engineering is about having a long, broad context window to understand all the pieces that came before, all the pieces that are coming in the future, and the pieces that sit adjacent to code, and if you know anything about AI, the one thing that is most expensive to do with AI is expanding the context window,” Doctorow said. Doctorow is famous for having coined the term “enshittification” to describe the common, modern-day phenomenon of almost every tech platform becoming soulless, dysfunctional and widely-hated corpses that internet users are still trapped under.Â It’s a cathartically profane critique of capitalism in the tech age that Macquaire Dictionary picked as its word of the year in 2024. He argues that what tech bosses actually like is to have tech workers “terrified that they’re about to be replaced by a chatbot, it gives them a chance to put them in their place.” To understand why, you need to look into how the dynamic has changed in the tech workplace in the past two decades. “The way that tech bosses motivated tech workers was appealing to their sense of mission,” Doctorow said. It was a double-edged sword: it both motivated the tech workers to work grueling hours, but it also made them passionate about the product and its purpose. So, if the boss decided to make changes at the expense of that vision of greater good and in the pursuit of greater margins, the workers tended to fight for the user. One example of that was the Google employee protests over the controversial military AI initiative Project Maven, which successfully saw the tech giant walk back its involvement. Back then, Doctorow argues, tech workers were a good way to keep the industry in check because they had a sense of purpose and they had power. Demand for workers far exceeded the supply, so if things were going awry in the company’s progress towards its mission, they could threaten to leave. There were many other opportunities that they could switch to. But things have since changed, and supply has caught up with demand. Roughly 400,000 tech employees have been laid off in the past two years alone. Silicon Valley companies are asking their employees to work 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week, a schedule known as “996” that was popularized in China. Meanwhile, big tech companies are spending big and making record profits. Nvidia just became the first and only company to hit a $4.5 trillion market cap. The power dynamic has now switched, and the power is with the bosses. And this time around, according to Doctorow, they want to make sure that the power dynamic stays that way. “Tech bosses have shown us how they treat workers they’re not afraid of,” Doctorow said, pointing the finger at Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Federal injury data from 2022 found that Amazon warehouse workers were seriously injured at more than twice the rate at other warehouses. A subsequent Senate probe from 2024 concluded that Amazon had been manipulating its self-reported injury data to make its warehouses appear safer. “The minute Jeff Bezos can put a piss jar next to your workstation, he will,” Doctorow said. “At this point, when Google is firing 12,000 workers, and then doing a $70 billion stock buyback that would have paid their wages for the next 27 years, you need a union,” he advised. If Doctorow’s estimates are true, then AI won’t take over any jobs. But then what about the billions and billions of dollars that have been poured into the AI industry, so much so that those investments are almost entirely driving American economic growth? “The great kind of tragedy and terror of all of this is that AI, if it can’t do your job, then whatever benefits we get from it are not commensurate with the capital expenditures that we’ve made for it, nor will they be sufficiently profitable to incur the operational expenses associated with maintaining these large foundation models,” Doctorow said. TLDR on that: He thinks there is an AI bubble. And he is not alone in thinking like this; many other experts have been sounding the alarms of a rapidly growing AI bubble. In a notable addition this week, the United Kingdom’s central bank said that “equity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on Artificial Intelligence,” and that this could lead to a sudden, sharp correction. The Bank said that stock market price valuations were comparable to the peak of the dot-com bubble, and that the market share of the top five members of the S&P 500 was at its highest concentration in 50 years. Those five are the AI-heavy big tech giants Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta. Lina Khan painted a picture of some other reasons why experts believe there is an AI bubble at the event on Thursday. “There have been increasing discussion about how we may actually be just seeing a big AI bubble,” the former FTC chair said. “We’re seeing all of these circular investments where it’s like the same five to seven companies just handing each other big bags of cash, saying, IOU, we’re seeing, you know, increasing reporting in the business press that even though we’re seeing such significant investment in AI, increasingly, firms are being candid that they don’t know what the profitable use case is going to be, but are just kind of afraid of missing out.” In her time in office, Khan’s FTC opened inquiries into the various deals and partnerships between big tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft and the then-rising, now-reigning AI labs OpenAI and Anthropic. A bubble is worrying. A pop is even more worrisome. “I think we’re going to see a collapse, and it’s going to be very bad,” Doctorow said. “I think 2008 is going to look like a golden age when AI pops.” Explore more on these topics Share this story Subscribe and interact with our community, get up to date with our customised Newsletters and much more.

Drive more traffic to your site. Use AI to save time doing SEO tasks. Make SEO easier. And get 24/7 support. Includes Local SEO, Video SEO & News SEO. Heads up! Black Friday is almost here, and if you still haven’t prepared, it’s time to act fast. The clock is ticking, but you can still make meaningful updates that count. This article covers practical and straightforward last minute Black Friday tips to help you make quick, effective changes to your eCommerce store. Even with just a few days left, there’s still room to attract customers and make the most of the biggest shopping event of the year. Did you know? Numbers show that Black Friday 2024 broke all records, as U.S. shoppers spent a staggering $ 10.8 billion online, representing a 10.2 percent increase from 2023. These numbers prove one thing: it is never too late to take action and grab your share of the Black Friday rush. The fastest way to put your Black Friday campaign on pilot mode is by focusing on a few essentials that make an immediate difference. These must-do, last minute Black Friday tips are your quick wins, helping you cover the basics, build momentum, and set up the foundation for a successful marketing campaign. When shoppers land on your website, your Black Friday deals should be impossible to miss. Highlight your best offers right on the homepage or add a static banner so visitors see them immediately. The clearer your offers are, the easier it is for customers to take action. One of the most innovative ways to increase engagement is by using countdown timers. They build urgency, encourage faster decisions, and make shoppers feel like they’re part of something time-sensitive. The Diamond Store saw this in action when they added a live countdown clock to their 24-hour Black Friday email campaign. The result? A 400% higher conversion rate compared to their previous emails. For WordPress users, OptinMonster is a quick way to get started. It lets you create dynamic floating bars and banners with countdowns, all through a simple drag-and-drop builder. If you’re using Shopify, the Essential Countdown Timer Bar app works perfectly for creating announcement bars or cart countdowns to drive urgency and prevent cart abandonment. Did you know a long or confusing checkout process is one of the biggest reasons shoppers abandon their carts, especially during high-traffic days like Black Friday? That’s the last thing you want when every second counts. Before the rush begins, take a few minutes to go through your own checkout process on both desktop and mobile. Place a test order just like a customer would. Verify that your discount codes are applied correctly, your payment options load smoothly, and the overall flow feels quick and effortless. Read more: Boost your checkout page UX: Vital tips for online stores Ask a few friends, family members, or even teammates to try it too. Fresh eyes often spot friction points you might miss, such as unclear buttons, confusing forms, or slow-loading pages. Trust also plays a huge role. Ensure your checkout page displays secure payment badges and recognizable gateways, such as PayPal, Apple Pay, or Stripe. When shoppers feel confident their payment is safe, they’re far more likely to hit “Buy now.” And one last tip: keep it simple. The fewer distractions and clicks, the smoother the path to purchase. That’s precisely what drives conversions during a last minute Black Friday rush. Black Friday emails have been shown to generate 33 percent higher conversion rates than regular marketing messages. That alone makes it one of the smartest last minute Black Friday tips to focus on. When time is short, your existing customer base is your best asset. They already trust your brand and are far more likely to act quickly on your offers. Keep your email focused and straightforward. Start with a subject line that clearly highlights your best deal or most significant discount. For example, in the screenshot below, you can see how the key offer or discount is prominently displayed in the subject line, while the body reinforces the offer with a clear call to action. Inside the email, make your main offer impossible to miss. Emphasize the key benefits of your product or service, and include a direct call to action that takes users straight to your Black Friday sale page. Make it visually engaging by adding a countdown timer or a short GIF that brings energy and urgency to the message. Remember, this isn’t about crafting a perfect campaign. It’s about getting the right message to the right people at the right time. A simple, well-timed email can make a real difference in your Black Friday sales. Social media continues to play a significant role in Black Friday success. It has seen a 7 percent year-over-year increase in traffic, now driving around 10 percent of all global mobile traffic referrals during the holiday season. Your audience is already scrolling, searching, and shopping, so this is your opportunity to be where they are. In these last few days, your social media strategy should focus on building anticipation and trust. If you have customer review videos, testimonials, or any user-generated content, start sharing them now. Boosting these posts or running quick ad campaigns featuring real customer stories can help you build credibility fast. People are far more likely to buy when they see genuine experiences from others. You can also collaborate with a micro-influencer or a brand advocate who already has a connection with your target audience. Even a brief post, story, or reel from them can draw attention to your sale and help you gain visibility. If you are short on time, focus only on your most active platform, whether that is Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, or LinkedIn. Post your best offer as a pinned post or a story highlight and use countdown stickers or short video snippets to create a sense of urgency. Lastly, remember to engage. Reply to comments, answer questions, and reshare posts from happy customers. Small interactions can make your brand feel more approachable and help you stand out during the Black Friday rush. Must read: How to handle comments on your blog If you haven’t touched your SEO yet, don’t worry. There’s still time to make a few quick updates that can help your store appear in the search results. These last minute Black Friday SEO tweaks can enhance visibility, attract the right audience, and might give your deals a competitive edge. Start with your meta titles and meta descriptions. Add words like Black Friday 2025, sale, or deal to your titles so searchers know what to expect. For example, instead of ‘Women’s handbags – Classic collection,’ you can try ‘Black Friday 2025 deals on women’s handbags.’ Keep it relevant, natural, and clear. Next, check your product and landing pages. Make sure they’re up to date with current pricing, stock status, and offers. Highlight the discounts in your product descriptions, and, if possible, include keywords that shoppers might search for, such as ‘best Black Friday deals’ or ‘holiday gift offers.’ Another smart move is to reuse your existing content. If you already have an older Black Friday or holiday gift guide, simply refresh it for 2025 by updating the year, offers, and internal links. It’s a fast way to keep your content relevant without having to start from scratch. Lastly, take a minute to review your page experience. A fast, mobile-friendly site can make or break your Black Friday sales. Run a quick check using Google’s PageSpeed Insights and fix anything that’s slowing your pages down. Even minor improvements can help increase conversions. These quick wins may not replace a comprehensive Black Friday SEO strategy. However, they can still make your website more discoverable and help you capture traffic from shoppers actively seeking deals. Okay, so the must-dos can help you frame a solid last minute marketing campaign. But if you’ve managed to check those off quickly and still have a little time on your hands, don’t stop there. The following few ideas may seem optional, but they can give your campaign the extra boost it needs to capture more attention, convert hesitant shoppers, and capitalize on the Black Friday rush. Don’t let potential buyers slip away after visiting your store. Retargeting ads help remind them of products they viewed or added to their carts, increasing the chances of conversion. Even a short, time-bound campaign with strong visuals and clear CTAs can make a difference during the Black Friday rush. Shoppers love convenience, especially during the holidays. Bundling complementary products or creating quick gift sets can simplify decision-making and increase your average order value. Highlight these as limited-time deals to develop a sense of urgency and drive faster sales. Many customers abandon their carts when questions go unanswered. Adding a live chat feature helps resolve last minute queries instantly and keeps buyers engaged throughout the checkout process. Tools like Tidio and LiveChat integrate seamlessly with both WordPress and Shopify, making setup quick and easy. Getting your offers in front of the right people starts with how your website appears and performs in search results. That’s where Yoast SEO can be a real game-changer during the Black Friday rush.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Arista Networks (NYSE: ANET) stock dropped by 6% on October 14, and is now trading at $139. This decline was triggered by investor concern over new reports. Specifically, reports that Meta and Oracle plan to adopt NVIDIA's Spectrum-X Ethernet networking devices for their AI data centers were perceived as a significant competitive threat to Arista, a major provider of cloud networking solutions. Our algorithm-based multi-factor evaluation indicates that it might be the right time to purchase additional ANET shares. Overall, we maintain a positive outlook on the stock, and a target price of $181 seems feasible. We think there is nothing to fear in ANET stock, considering its overall Very Strong operational performance and financial health. Therefore, despite its Very High valuation, the stock is seen as Attractive but Volatile. Here is our evaluation: ANET stock has seen a notable decline recently, and we see it as attractive yet volatile. While this might seem like an opportunity, there is substantial risk in depending on a single stock. Conversely, a broader diversified strategy that we apply with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio provides significant value. Let us pose this question: Over the past 5 years, which index do you think the Trefis High Quality Portfolio outperformed: the S&P 500, S&P 1500 Equal Weighted, or both? The response may surprise you. Discover how our advisory framework assists in tilting the odds in your favor. Let’s delve into the details of each of the evaluated factors, but before that, for a quick background: With $174 Bil in market capitalization, Arista Networks delivers cloud networking solutions on a global scale, as well as post-contract services such as technical support, hardware repair, parts replacement, bug fixes, patches, and upgrades. This table illustrates how ANET is valued compared to the broader market. For more details, see: ANET Valuation Ratios This table shows how ANET is growing compared to the broader market. For additional details, see: ANET Revenue Comparison This table illustrates how ANET's profitability compares with the broader market.

Title: AI Bubble May Pop — Wiping Out $40 Trillion. Learn What Could Happen And What To Do
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2025/10/15/ai-bubble-may-pop---wiping-out-40-trillion-learn-what-could-happen-and-what-to-do/

ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. The generative AI boom is characterized by massive debt accumulation, projected to reach $1.5 trillion for infrastructure by 2028, and concerning circular financing schemes where investors fund customers who then buy their products.Significant financial instability is evident from OpenAI's high cash burn and the 95% failure rate of AI pilot projects, raising doubts about the sector's actual return on investment and profitability. The generative AI boom grew even bigger this week when Open AI announced its latest multibillion-dollar chip deal, this time with Broadcom – sending its stock up 10%, CNBC reported. The agreement, along with pacts with AMD and Oracle, is one of many that’s pumping money into an AI bubble that looks like it could end much like the dot-com bubble did. Will it end liked the dot-com collapse — which sent the Nasdaq down 78%? If such a value decimation began today, it would ultimately swipe $40 trillion from the Nasdaq’s market capitalization. Or will the Gen AI boom continue for decades? Read on to learn how to tell which scenario is most likely. In March 2000, the dot-com bubble – which began with the 1995 initial public offering of Netscape – began bursting. The collapse subtracted $3.6 trillion from the Nasdaq’s market capitalization. There was also lots of debt -- $500 billion borrowed to build fiber optic networks went largely unrepaid due to the bankruptcy of telecom providers such as WorldCom and Global Crossing. While the Nasdaq began declining from its peak on March 10, two events on March 20, 2000 lit the fuse to this cash conflagration. That day "Burning Up," a Barron’s cover story by Jack Willoughby – who interviewed me for the article – was published. Willoughby’s column listed 51 publicly traded Internet firms he forecast would burn through their cash out of 207 by March 2001. That same day, MicroStrategy – whose CEO Michael Saylor is now Executive Chairman leading the renamed company’s strategy of selling stock to buy bitcoin – announced a revenue restatement for 1998 to 1999 due to "aggressive accounting practices," according to the Securities and Exchange Commission. MicroStrategy’s accounting irregularities further shattered investor confidence. By April, the company also restated 1997 results – news of which sent the stock down 91% from its peak. The GenAI boom has certain parallels with the dot-com one. There is OpenAI – the cash incinerating startup driving the hype; debt-heavy infrastructure operators such as CoreWeave; and cash rich providers of customer financing – notably Nvidia and Oracle – to encourage those cash-burning startups to buy more of their picks and shovels, about which I wrote in my book Brain Rush. To build data centers, infrastructure operators are borrowing more than $1 trillion, according to a recent Morgan Stanley study. This could end badly if the cash required to repay that debt is insufficient to cover interest payments. I see three scenarios: GenAI keeps booming, there’s a soft-landing in which valuations decline somewhat, and the OpenAI bankruptcy scenario which brings it all down abruptly should the company be unable to raise more capital to fund its money-losing operations. The bursting of the dot-com bubble wiped out more equity – much of it held by individuals because so many dot-com companies had gone public – than debt. But the unpaid debt damaged lenders and other institutions. For example, WorldCom’s $41 billion bankruptcy and Global Crossing’s $12.4 billion collapse resulted from debt service way in excess of their money losing operations’ ability to repay. During the telecom boom, companies laid 80 million miles of fiber optic cable – between 85% and 95% of which remained unused years after the crash, The Bubble Bubble reported. Today’s GenAI boom could wipe out a significant amount of privately held equity value. While it does not appear a peak has been reached, the debt taken on to finance the building of AI data centers is expected to be even larger than it was during the dot-com boom. Major tech companies pledged a record $320 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, Fortune wrote. That number is growing so much that capex is forecast to reach $2 trillion by 2028 – a whopping $1.5 trillion of which will come from various forms of debt, according to Morgan Stanley. Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft generate massive cash flows. But the growth in debt to build AI data centers highlights the strain on their internal resources. The Morgan Stanley report suggests external financing, including high-cost private credit deals, is necessary to supplement their free cash flow. Investors should note Oracle’s recent experience: the company is already losing $100 million quarterly on its data center rentals to OpenAI noted AInvest despite signing a $300 billion, five-year deal, as I wrote in a September Forbes post. If Oracle — a relatively disciplined operator— can’t make AI infrastructure profitable, who can? The most alarming parallel to 2000 involves circular financing arrangements in which a company finances its customer’s purchases. Nvidia, Microsoft and others are now engaging in this practice. Here are five examples: These circular deals are not enough to satisfy OpenAI’s ambition. The company aims to build 250 gigawatts of new computing capacity by 2033 with a price tag exceeding $10 trillion, noted Bloomberg. What if enterprises – which are consuming much of the the data center capacity being built to train and operate AI chatbots – decide they are wasting their money? With 95% of AI pilot projects failing to to yield meaningful results, according to MIT NANDA, that absence of a return on their $40 billion investment could come soon if a recession is near. What could trigger a bursting of the AI boom? OpenAI needs to reach $125 billion in revenue just to break even—a target not expected until 2029, Reuters reported. Until then, the ChatGPT provider must finance its losses by raising capital. A loss of confidence in the industry’s ability to borrow money to build more AI data centers could send investors scrambling for the exits. However, given the small number of publicly-traded AI chatbot providers, it is difficult to envision another article like Willoughby’s March 2000 “Burning Up” – which was based on dozens of public companies likely to burn through their cash. Differences between today and 2000 may make a GenAI crash less severe. Unlike the dot-com era’s 2,288 IPOs, noted International Banker, many of today’s AI companies remain private. More than 300 enterprise software unicorns are trapped without exits. Their median age is “11.5 years, and 50% need to raise or exit within 12 months,” wrote SaaStr. The relatively small number of GenAI IPOs could limit the damage of a crash. In 2000, retail investors were borrowing money to bet on publicly-traded Internet companies which collapsed after they burned through their cash. Retail investors’ losses spread the dot-com collapse’s pain more widely. If recently public GenAI companies – such as CoreWeave or SoundHound -- were to implode, their relatively small number might limit the damage. Another thing that’s better about today is the high profitability of many of the tech giants betting on AI. Today, the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 contribute 28.8% of total earnings – a big jump from 2000’s 16.1%, reported Fortune. Investors should prepare for three scenarios: To get a sense of which scenario is most likely investors should monitor these indicators: When today’s equivalent of Willoughy’s Barron’s article appears — providing specific data on which companies will run out of cash when — the psychological foundation will crack. The question is not if such a moment comes, but when, and whether the AI boom’s stronger fundamentals can cushion the fall that dot-com’s relative lack of substance made inevitable.

I got the call a little before 5 p.m. on a Friday. My wife, Sima, and I were sitting on the couch with our kids, probably watching Curious George. The White House vetting process had gone on for months. Yet, despite the Zooms and document requests and endless online forms, I had a strange certainty that I ultimately would not be selected. “You’ve said … a lot of stuff,” observed the twentysomething staffer who got my file. The end of the day Friday is when Washington takes out the trash. It’s when you push out the bad news so it’s old news by Monday’s news cycle. So when the call came in, I looked at my phone, looked at Sima, and dismissively said as I stood to take the call something like: “Ah. This is the White House saying they’re not picking me.” Indeed, until the precise moment the words came out of the phone—“President Biden is going to nominate you to the Federal Trade Commission on Monday”—I remained convinced it was never going to happen. But it did. By that point, in September 2021, I’d spent most of my career working for two causes: privacy and immigrant rights. I stood up the Senate privacy subcommittee for Senator Al Franken and organized oversight hearings into Google and Apple and Facebook and the National Security Agency. I started the D.C. area’s first college scholarship that was blind to immigration status. As a law professor, I built a team that figured out how Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, finds people it wants to deport by pooling and mining their gas, water, and electric bills. I also served on the board of CASA, an extraordinary immigrant rights group that calls Kilmar Ábrego García a dues-paying member. I denounced the Trump administration’s decision to separate parents from their children at the border. I called ICE an “out of control domestic surveillance agency.” I even called the president a racist on social media. I got confirmed by the skin of my crooked teeth. It didn’t matter that I had deep experience on privacy—a core issue in the FTC’s consumer protection work. No Republican voted for me in the Senate Commerce Committee. No Republican voted for me on the floor of the Senate either. Vice President Kamala Harris had to travel to the Capitol to cast a tie-breaking vote in my favor—three times. One Republican senator told me why. We’d just had a long conversation about what social media was doing to teenagers’ mental health, and what I wanted to do about it. “I like you,” he said. “I look forward to working with you. But I can’t vote for you because of what you said about the president.” I came into office an unabashed advocate for immigrants. I left office the same way. But while that hasn’t changed, after three years as a commissioner, the way I look at the world has. I used to think that the defining fight for our country was between the left and the right. Now, I am much more worried about the money at the top crushing everyone underneath. That sounds grim because it is. But I also think this perspective can unite our country in a way that feels almost impossible today. When you are confirmed to the FTC, after you get your badge and keys and figure out your computer, the conference invitations start chiming in your inbox: Aspen, Brussels, Vegas, Davos. I declined those invites. My first trip was to Charleston, West Virginia. I had spent a lot of time during my confirmation process trying to teach myself about the pharmaceutical supply chain, and the way it affected pharmacies in rural and urban America. Along the way, I spent some time on the phone with Lynne Fruth, the second-generation owner of an independent pharmacy chain in Appalachia. She told me about how insurance companies were using intermediaries called “pharmacy benefit managers” to systematically steer lucrative prescriptions to their own mail-order pharmacies—not the ones that were convenient for their patients. I later read a West Virginia state insurance commissioner’s report about a family who had almost been turned away from a local pharmacy. Their child was sick with cancer. The pharmacy had the right medicine in stock. But an insurance company middleman told them to go home and wait up to two weeks for the medicine to arrive in the mail. So one night, after feeding the kids dinner, I got in my car and drove out to meet Fruth. As I left my house in Rockville, I turned on a podcast whose sole purpose was to explain the acronym soup of pharmaceutical pricing: “WAC,” “MAC,” “NADAC.” It got me well past Harper’s Ferry—more than an hour away. The next morning, in an office park just outside of Charleston, a roomful of independent pharmacists told me about the bizarre “negotiations” with those middlemen. Any wins were made on the phone. But the middlemen could undo those concessions at any time via fax. The pharmacists described being “audited” by those middlemen. Somehow, they were always fined by those same middlemen for noncompliance. And now, drug reimbursements from those insurers were going through the floor. In the pandemic, those independent pharmacists had vaccinated thousands of people, often in the poorest and most isolated areas unserved by national pharmacy chains. Their customers had heard all sorts of things about the vaccine online or on television. But they trusted their local pharmacists. Now, those independent pharmacies were closing, one after another. One pharmacist said, with a sad laugh, that he had started selling Jack Daniel’s just to keep the lights on. Toward the end of our session, a retired accountant named Jim Rossi started to speak. He had joined the meeting at Fruth’s request. He ticked through his daily routine of 15 pills for nine medicines treating three autoimmune disorders and a heart condition that required a pacemaker. He then told me what it was like to get all that via mail-order pharmacy. “It takes about a week to resolve any kind of a small issue with them,” he said. “Then, it takes them another week to fill the prescription. Then after that additional week wait, they ship the medication to me.” That took another three days to a week. His specialist had warned him to stick with the same manufacturer for each prescription. That’s not what came in the mail. “I open up the bottle, and there are three different colors of pills in it, which tells me there’s three different manufacturers in that bottle.” But there was one drug, for his Crohn’s disease, that the mail-order pharmacy filled unfailingly fast and in advance. He sometimes had a nine-month supply in a drawer at home. That one cost $1,000 a month. My second trip on the job was to Des Moines, where I met with nine corn growers and cattlemen in a hotel conference room on the sidelines of a law enforcement conference. The session was organized by my adviser, Max Miller, who had just left a job as an Iowa assistant attorney general to join my staff. This was the meat and potatoes of Max’s practice. I felt out of place in a suit and an N-95 mask. That went away when they started talking. Every person described a situation in which corporate power was squeezing them. They used to have any number of vendors to buy their seeds from; now there were two. The suppliers of all their inputs—feed, fertilizer, pesticides, you name it—had slowly consolidated and were jacking up prices. The ag industry was known for relentless innovation. “We doubled our yields in a generation,” the farmers said. But now, the companies weren’t focused on research and development. “They’re using their wealth to buy their competitors,” they said. The ranchers used to have any number of places to process their cattle. Now, a lot of them had just one meatpacking plant accessible to them. When you have just one place to sell your livestock, no one competes to buy it. What the processor pays is what you get. They used to fix their own tractors. Now, John Deere locked down its software, forcing them to take those tractors to a company dealership. “It’s like getting picked apart by a chicken,” said one of them. Said another: “We have a noose around our necks, and we’re standing on an ice cube.” But the problem went beyond income. When there’s just one processor, you have to get to that processor regardless of how far it is. Cattle die in the heat of the drive. And when that processor closes—as many did during Covid—there’s nowhere else to take your livestock. One rancher had to gas his hogs, dig ditches, and hire high schoolers “to fill holes with dead hogs.” Another rancher told me about how his one processor treated his animals. A cow had slipped upon arrival at the lot. She was injured and could not regain her footing. The rancher begged staff to let him take her home to heal, but that request was denied. No livestock could leave the premises. She was attached to a log chain, dragged out of the trailer, killed with a bolt to the head, and thrown in a dumpster. One of the last places I visited as a commissioner was a community center in a small park in Miami’s Little Havana. It was after sunset in early April, but it was already 80 degrees and muggy. Amid the sounds of creaking swings and little kids cutting their bikes through the playground, a dozen men trickled into the room after finishing construction and landscaping shifts in the Miami region, home to Jeff Bezos, billionaire hedge fund manager Ken Griffin, and over a hundred centimillionaires. Most of them were in their twenties and thirties. They wore baseball caps and crisp T-shirts. They looked like they had gone home, showered, and walked into the room a few moments later. They were tired. I expected their main problem to be that they didn’t get unemployment insurance, workers’ compensation, or overtime. And I was right to a point. They didn’t. Even though they showed up at work and did what they were told, how they were told, and when they were told to do it, their bosses deemed them “independent contractors”—independent business owners, not W-2 employees. (I later heard an interview with an organizer who said he met workers who didn’t even know what overtime was—they’d never heard of it. “No saben que cosa es ‘overtime,’” he said.) But that wasn’t their main complaint. Their main complaint was that they didn’t get water. I did not expect that. “Maybe there’s a thermos that’s filled with water that’s not potable,” said an organizer from WeCount!, the group that called the meeting. “Maybe there’s a thermos that’s covered in mold.” One of the men worked for hours in over 100-degree heat while staring at a cooler—his only source of bottled water. The cooler was locked. The prior year, a 47-year-old worker had died while remodeling a multimillion-dollar home in Coral Gables. The heat index was 104. A Tampa Bay Times investigation found that 37 outdoor workers died from heat-related causes in Florida over the past decade, “some just hundreds of feet from air conditioning and running water.” Federal safety inspectors were nowhere to be found. “There’s no water. There’s no harness training. We’ll go a month without the most minimum contact with OSHA”—the Occupational Safety and Health Administration—said a painter named Ronny. What if he complained to his employer? Most of the workers were undocumented, Ronny explained. “When you ask for the law, you lose your job.” So, the workers had gone to the county commission, and they succeeded in securing the passage of a law mandating water breaks for local construction sites. Six days after we met, Republican Governor Ron DeSantis blocked the ordinance. My second-to-last trip was to New York City, where I met with rideshare drivers gathered in a lecture hall at Fordham Law School near Lincoln Center. There were about 20 or 25 of them. They described being lured by promises of lucrative earnings accompanied by near-total control of their schedules. Many of them invested tens of thousands of dollars in new vehicles so they could get the best fares. A lot of them had a good experience; some had had it good for years. But recently, the apps started locking them out at seemingly random times of day. The first driver I heard from was named Mohamed Mohamed. He had maintained a five-star rating and a 100 percent acceptance rate over 21,000 rides and nine years of driving. At the start, he liked that the companies called him a “partner.” “You’re a partner for us,” he recalled them telling him. Now, “I take three trips, I stop to go to the bathroom, and I’m locked out for the end of the day,” he said. He was in $2,000 of credit card debt. And he now had to drive 12 hours to earn what he previously earned in four. Then another driver sat down to speak. I didn’t catch his name; I noticed he was shaking. His wife had died unexpectedly that morning. But he had been inexplicably kicked off the apps altogether with no explanation. He showed up anyway, because someone in government was finally going to listen to him. “This is not fair,” he yelled. “And I need the account back on to go to work. Because the city provided me a license to work, to be a good citizen. I am.” He was crying. “I do everything. Pandemic, I work. Snow, I work. Why I cannot live like a decent people?” The despair in this country is far deeper than most of us understand. It’s worse than that, actually: It’s so pervasive that we don’t even see it. It’s become normal. In the wealthiest country on Earth, it’s normal for people who are diagnosed with cancer to set up a web page to beg their friends and family for money. It’s normal for those people to go bankrupt. Getting sick is the most normal reason to go bankrupt. In a country that celebrates farmers, it’s normal for those farmers to kill themselves at a rate far beyond the rest of the population. At a time when billionaires compete to launch rockets into space, it’s normal—completely normal—for construction workers to die of heat and thirst. Many liberals remain baffled that America elected Donald Trump. They genuinely have no idea how he could have won the election. I don’t think that Trump won because of “wokeism” or the “trans agenda,” whatever that is. I think he won by speaking to that despair and telling people that he alone could fix it. His tirades against China and “illegals”? Some people listened to them and heard bigotry and xenophobia. I heard it, too. But more people heard a guy talking about how he was going to help them make rent. At least enough people to win the election. My time as a commissioner changed the way I saw things. I always suspected that despite Trump’s promises to cap credit card fees and slash prices and bring manufacturing back home, all of it would more or less amount to nothing. So far, other than temporarily reducing taxes on tips, that’s pretty much what’s happened. Instead, we face looming health care and childcare cuts for millions, a slowdown in manufacturing, and on-again-off-again tariffs indexed to whether a country will nominate Donald Trump for a Nobel Prize. Chaos and cruelty don’t pay the rent. But I expected all that. What I did not expect was that over time, people I’d seen as bold progressives started to look quite different. I always thought of Colorado Governor Jared Polis as a pathbreaker: the first openly gay man and first Jewish person elected governor in the state. Now, all I can think about is how he vetoed a law that would make it dramatically easier for people in Colorado to form a union … and a law that would have barred landlords from using algorithms to collude on rent hikes … and a law, passed unanimously in the state legislature, to end surprise ambulance bills … in two weeks. I always liked how Illinois Governor JB Pritzker stood up for the little guy: for undocumented people, for trans kids. I love how he seems genuinely unafraid of this president. But it’s harder to see him in the same light after watching him veto a bill that would have protected workers at Amazon warehouses—where injuries are so frequent that the company puts vending machines on its warehouse floors that dispense not potato chips, but painkillers. Why can’t Pritzker fight for the people in warehousing? Perhaps my biggest change is in how I think about what’s happening with ICE. The masked police, the flash renditions, the swamp gulag—we now live in the dystopia that we were loudly warned about during the president’s first term. But when I see police tackle a teenager with a baby’s teething toy in her hand, when I see them peel a child off of her dad’s arm at the courthouse, or cuff a shrieking mother saying she needs to get her kids from school, my first thought is not to “immigrant rights.” No. Now, I can’t stop thinking about the lawyer in a hand-stitched suit sitting at my old FTC conference table, telling me, over 70 minutes and a 30-page PowerPoint, how it could not possibly be in the interest of the United States government to sue her corporate client. And I’m not talking about one particular case; I’m talking about all of them. When the federal government does things like investigate a corporate landlord for packing rent checks with fake charges, or an oil executive allegedly trying to “align U.S. oil production with OPEC,” or pharmacy middlemen accused of trying to raise the price of insulin—it’s sternly worded letters, PDF white papers, and multiple hour-long meetings where the company gets to tell us what we got wrong. That’s standard process. But when you’re a cleaning lady whose papers aren’t right? It’s five men in bulletproof vests on your doorstep, and your four-year-old crumpled in your arms begging “no quiero please, please, please.” It’s an agent saying, “I’m sorry, but I don’t have any choice.” And that difference enrages me. Soon after taking office, Trump’s designated chairman of the FTC, Andrew Ferguson, announced that the agency would “usher in a new Golden Age for American businesses, workers, and consumers.” What has followed has been a Golden Age for the C-suite. The ban on noncompete clauses that keep everyone from pediatric surgeons to Jimmy John’s sandwich-makers in dead-end positions, or keep them from working entirely? Not worth defending in court. The rule banning companies from doing that thing where they sign you up for a subscription online, but only let you unsubscribe over the phone? Enforcement delayed to mid-July to give companies “ample time” to comply … and the federal court a window to strike it down. The order barring that oil executive from the board of Exxon? Undone. He’s free and clear to join. A similar scene unfolded 10 blocks west at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The bank that was systematically hitting service members with surprise overdraft fees and forced to send them $80 million in refunds? Don’t have to pay them back anymore. The lawsuit against a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary that allegedly tricked people into taking out loans for mobile homes when they had $57.78 in discretionary income? Gone. As everyone knows, these are just the lowlights. What people may not know is how thoroughly unprepared we are for this reality. Picture the inauguration. If the president tries to illegally deport you or illegally strip you of your voting rights or (ahem) illegally fire you, there are dozens of nonprofits that can step up to defend you in court, free of cost. Many struggle to make payroll. Some have tens of millions of dollars in the bank. The American Civil Liberties Union has $829 million. But what if the billionaires over the president’s shoulder hurt you? If they use legal loopholes to deny you health care? If they dock or block your pay for no apparent reason? If they buy all of your buyers so that only they buy your goods, and they set the price? If they use their market power not to outcompete you, but to bully you out of the market? There are maybe a handful of national nonprofit organizations that will represent you pro bono. And the ACLU fights the government, not the oligarchs. This all-encompassing focus on fighting government overreach may have made sense when our tax system actually taxed the rich, when union membership was at an all-time high, and when CEO earnings were not a vulgarity. Now, Fortune 500 firms regularly pay zero dollars in taxes. Unions protect just one in 10 workers. And CEOs parade like modern-day Roman emperors, in private jets, to private islands, with their private Praetorian firefighters and guards. And all of this is happening when the government agencies built to check corporate power are being torn apart. My daughter likes me to watch her gymnastics class. Let me try that again. My daughter really doesn’t like it when I stare at my phone during her gymnastics class. She has her mother’s strength. So when she makes it around the uneven bars a little faster than her peers, the first thing she does is shoot me a look. If I’m looking at my phone, that’s a big “L” for dad. And so, on a Tuesday this March, when I got a call a few moments after arriving at the gym from my colleague, Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, asking, “Hey, have you checked your email?”—I proudly said I had not! “Well, I just got an email from the White House saying they were firing me. You should probably check yours.” Sure enough, I had an email from someone named Trent Morse informing me that the president was firing me, effective immediately. Curiously, Morse did not claim I had neglected my duties or misused my authority; he went out of his way to not give a reason for the firing. That was a problem—for them. Because the Supreme Court had said, 90 years earlier, that the president could only remove an FTC commissioner “for cause.” The court said that unanimously. Suddenly, we had to answer a really weird question really quickly: If the president says you’re fired, but the Supreme Court says he can’t fire you, did you get fired? Or did you not get fired? Becca and I decided we did not get fired. We would keep doing our jobs. We’d keep on taking meetings, issuing statements, testifying before Congress. And we thought we should be loud about it. I called Sima, and my chief of staff. Then I put out a statement saying that the president was trying to turn the FTC, a fierce corporate watchdog, into “a lapdog for his golfing buddies.” The calls started. The New York Times, Bloomberg, a producer for Chris Hayes. My daughter got out of class, and I told her I’d been fired. She gave me a hug, got in the car, and asked if she could watch her favorite Lego builder on YouTube. FTC staff started calling. Then, more reporters. Ten minutes into the drive home, a little voice in the back seat piped up, “Papa, why are we going this way?” I was missing turns from the notifications on my screen, then missing more turns when my phone, which kept on dinging, was slow to update the map. When we finally got home, I recorded a video to explain how this wasn’t about hurting me, but about helping the men at the inauguration—Musk, Bezos, Zuckerberg, Pichai. Between the two of us, Becca and I had sued, or were actively suing, each of the men’s companies. And we were weeks from a federal trial against Meta. We did a virtual press conference with some senators and congressmen; I did more interviews after that. A little before midnight, there was a knock at our door. Domino’s. It was my first break since 5 p.m., and I was grateful for what I thought was a gesture from a friend who knew I’d be up late. I opened the box: meat lover’s, loaded with bacon. We don’t do bacon. I asked the delivery guy if he’d gotten a tip—he said no—so I started trying to find an app to pay him, when he spoke up to say, “Well, ah, sir, you still haven’t paid for the pizza.” That’s when we realized that the pizza was not from a friend. It was from someone, somewhere, telling me they knew where I lived. The days and weeks ping-ponged between the thrill of being able to publicly denounce what was happening to our agency—and the dull fear a parent feels when things are not right for their family. I hold virtual roundtables with rideshare drivers in Denver, fishermen from Maine, and small retailers in Massachusetts—someone tries to take out a half-million-dollar line of credit in my name. I speak at the Bernie and AOC rally in Denver; I scream so loud I pull a muscle in my neck. I realize we can’t buy a house on a single income, even though we’d been planning a move for months. Commissioner Slaughter and I quickly sued to block the attempt to remove us. The financial ramifications of the legal fight started to set in. Sima and I looked at our accounts and figured we could afford about three months for it to play out. The three-month mark approached with no ruling from the judge. So I decided to call the guys in Iowa. My very last visit as a commissioner was to a family farm in Ankeny, just north of Des Moines. It was scheduled for a Saturday morning in June. Going in, I knew that by Monday, unless I woke up to a ruling reinstating me, I’d issue a statement formally resigning as a commissioner, letting me start to look for a new job. Max, my former adviser, put me up at his house the night before. We woke up and went to the farmer’s market with his new wife and their now five kids. I got a coffee and a kielbasa. We drove up to Ankeny. The Iowa Farmers Union had organized a listening session at a fifth-generation diversified farm that grew corn, soybeans, oats, and alfalfa, along with a range of livestock. The owner, LaVon Griffieon, had attended that first meeting; so had a few others in the audience. This time, I was able to talk about our lawsuit against two pesticides manufacturers that were trying to push cheaper generics off the market, as well as about our lawsuit, filed just that January, against John Deere for locking down its software. The group was kind to me. They appreciated it, they said. But so many of their stories were the same that they were three years earlier. A corn and soybean grower said that fertilizer prices were moving in lockstep, such that the moment the farmers finally saw some profit, prices would go up and erase those profits. “Iowans like to claim they feed the world,” said Griffieon. “But the pandemic proved to us with bare store shelves that Iowa can’t even feed Iowa very easily.” A half-hour in, there was a speaker I hadn’t met—a tall, young farmer with long hair, also fifth-generation, named Sean Dengler. On the first day of the winter harvest, he had gotten up and turned on the combine. It roared, then whimpered, then went into “limp mode.” The circuit board was fried, and only John Deere could fix it. Sean’s father called the dealership right away, but the technician took hours to get there. A line of other farmers had called in first. The soybeans were already dry, and it was hot and windy. So they paid extra for the part to be delivered the next day; and again paid extra for the second visit. “We lost time waiting, which meant lost yield potential,” he said. “And we lost money because John Deere could charge us more because that is their business plan.” Our lawsuit was a few months too late. It was Sean’s last harvest. “Both of my grandparents were farmers,” he said. “I’m the last Dengler to ever farm in Tama County.” The session lasted another hour. I had lunch at a Mexican restaurant with the union president, his vice president, an ag reporter, and Josh Manske, a board member from Algona, Iowa. The lunch lasted about an hour. And that was it. I was done. Josh and I met Max in a park back in Des Moines, got some beers, and found an empty picnic table. We talked about Max’s blended family. I thanked Josh for hosting a liminal FTC commissioner. We laughed about that. We talked about the session. While a lot of things had come up, I kept coming back to Sean Dengler. Then, I thought about those rideshare drivers in New York City. It may not look this way at first, but the Iowa farmer who can’t run his combine because of a farm equipment monopoly has a heck of a lot in common with the Bangladeshi dad who can’t work the morning commute because he’s locked out by Uber and Lyft. If you focus on the conflict between left and right, if the most important thing is what you are—your party, your state, your race, your ethnicity—the people I met could not be more different. On the one hand, you have rural, white small-business owners, generations into building a life in this country. On the other, you have urban Latino, Haitian, African, and South Asian immigrants, every one of them a worker. The line between them is sharp, almost tribal. What could they possibly have in common? Everything—if you look at what they need. The people I met as a commissioner may look different, but what they need is surprisingly the same: They need a government that gives them a level playing field against the powerful and wealthy. They need the courts to check corporations when they abuse that power and wealth. They need basic dignity and control in their material lives. Looking at things that way, everyone I met was part of one huge group: people working themselves to the bone who were getting screwed by billionaires and corporations—regardless of party or state or race or ethnicity. Regardless, even, of whether they are workers or the owners of farms or small businesses. Populism is not an indictment, but an opportunity. Focusing on the conflict between the haves and the have-nots is not divisive; it’s a way to build coalitions with astonishing potential. Our nation’s first antitrust law was passed at the demand of small farmers bled dry by the railroads and grain elevators. But when Ohio’s John Sherman stood on the floor of the Senate to call for its passage in 1890, he didn’t just do it for the Grangers. He also talked about labor. The trust “commands the price of labor without fear of strikes,” he declared, “for in its field it allows no competitors.” When the law was abused to crack down on strikers, Samuel Gompers mobilized the American Federation of Labor and won corrections in the 1914 Clayton Act to try to guarantee them that right, while tightening other loopholes that John Rockefeller and the other robber barons had exploited. Gompers called the law a “Magna Carta for labor.” Then in 1936, small-town grocers came in to press for and win a separate law to stop the incipient A&P grocery chain—ancestor of the modern big-box stores—from cutting secret deals with their suppliers that slashed prices for A&P while marking them up for the little guys. Our anti-monopoly laws exist because of the work of farmers, labor unions, and country grocers. If that seems like an unlikely bunch, consider that Minnesota still does not have a “Democratic” party, but rather a Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, because of a resurgence of that coalition 30 years after the Sherman Act. Consider that the pharmacy deserts in Appalachia are caused by the same ruthless middlemen who create those deserts in Philadelphia. I know, because a session I had with the Philadelphia pharmacists was nearly identical to one I’d had in Charleston. The same goes for independent grocers. The people in Pine Ridge, South Dakota, live in an incipient food desert for the same reason that the people of downtown North Tulsa do: The government stopped enforcing the 1936 law (it was called the Robinson-Patman Act). And when we start enforcing it again, poor people in small towns and big cities—people told every day that they have nothing in common—will benefit in equal measure. I feel the potential for those fights anytime I hear how some conservatives talk about the tenure of Lina Khan, whom I served alongside when she was chair of the Federal Trade Commission. I felt it when I talked to people about my job. I had a favorite kind of conversation as a commissioner. I had some version of it at least three or four times. It was when a MAGA conservative asked me—a certified “left-wing activist,” “provocateur,” “bomb-thrower,” and “extremist”—to quote my friend Ted Cruz: What exactly is it you do in government? I would tell anyone who asked that I was investigating the pharmacy middlemen who were shutting down independent pharmacies across rural and urban America. I’d tell them I was suing Amazon for screwing over small retailers. I’d tell them I was making sure that the biggest grocery store in town doesn’t buy the next biggest grocery store in town—which will make eggs even more expensive and union negotiations even harder. I’d tell them I was trying to let gig workers organize so that Uber and Lyft and DoorDash couldn’t lie to them or cheat them out of their pay. I’d tell them I was suing landlords who pack rent bills with hidden fees. I definitely told them that we were trying to end that horrible thing where you sign up for something online but can only cancel on the phone before 4 p.m., after 45 minutes on hold. And usually, by that point, the conversation had changed. Their suspicion had turned into cautious interest, maybe even excitement. Undocumented people have become the new American underclass: good enough to pick our crops, bus our tables, and build our buildings—not good enough for us to protect their life or liberty, let alone their pursuit of happiness. There are many reasons for this. Some are legal. A lot of it is anger. I understand where some of the anger comes from. Take the construction industry. A generation of working-class kids grew up watching their dads provide for their families by working construction. They were hard jobs, but they were good ones. You could buy a house, send your kid to college, maybe even buy a boat for the weekends. Now, those jobs pay a fraction of what they used to. And those kids are now adults, voting adults, and they see those jobs occupied by men from Central and South America, many of whom are undocumented. What would it look like to confront undocumented immigration not as a left-right issue, but as a conflict between billionaires and working people? Maybe we focus less on the tension between undocumented people and the native-born workers that they seem to displace. Maybe we focus more on the billionaire developers who pretended that the people they hired were “independent contractors,” turning what used to be middle-class jobs into subsistence work, while also making it easier to hire and exploit undocumented laborers. Maybe we ask ourselves: Who gets rich from that? Is it the guy working in 100-degree heat with no water? Or is it the guy downing a steak while toasting his new development? Maybe we try to become skeptical of the idea that the least powerful people are the most responsible for our problems. Maybe we punch up instead of punching the neighbor. Nowadays, I think a lot about what’s happened to Ábrego García. The media has rightly focused on the outpouring of support for an apprentice sheet metal worker and his young family in Beltsville, Maryland. They are right to focus on the courthouse protests. They made a difference. But I have been moved by a different scene, which occurred in early April in a Washington, D.C., conference hall filled with electricians, ironworkers, and other tradespeople, members of the North America’s Building Trades Unions, where Ábrego García’s union is an affiliate. In this scene, NABTU president Sean McGarvey stands in front of his members, and says: We need to make our voices heard. We’re not red, we’re not blue. We’re the building trades, the backbone of America. You want to build a $5 billion data center? Want more six-figure careers with health care, retirement, and no college debt? You don’t call Elon Musk. You call us! [...] And yeah, that means all of us—all of us! Including our brother, SMART apprentice Kilmar Ábrego García, who we demand to be returned to us and his family now. He slams his fist on the podium. “Bring him home!” he shouts, as the audience gets out of their seats for a standing ovation. And that, to me, feels like the future. Alvaro M. Bedoya served as a federal trade commissioner from 2022 until President Trump fired him in March.

Title: AI Deals Are Scaling to Massive Valuations. But In Many Cases—Also Massive Dilution. See e.g., OpenAI

by Jason Lemkin | Artificial Intelligence (AI), SaaStr.Ai So there has never been a “start-up” like OpenAI. Already with 800,000,000+ users and a breathtaking $500 Billion (!) valuation. But it’s also raised and spent epic amounts. So as the chart from FT below shows — all the historic investors together, as a group, will likely own 10% after the company converts to a for-profit. All of them. From Khosla to Thrive to Founders Fund and more. OpenAI has now raised approximately $58 billion in primary funding across 11 rounds, with an additional $6.6 billion secondary sale in October 2025 at the $500 billion valuation. But the cash burn? That’s where it gets interesting. The company now projects it will burn $115 billion through 2029—that’s $80 billion higher than previously expected. Let that sink in. Not $115 billion raised. $115 billion burned. Breaking it down: This isn’t mismanagement. This is the cost of competing in frontier AI. The numbers are staggering: A 17x increase in less than three years. But when you’ve raised $58 billion and are burning over $100 billion to get there, the ownership math tells a different story. Looking at the projected ownership post-restructure (per FT Research and other sources): For founders and early investors who weren’t Microsoft, the dilution has been severe. Eight of the eleven original co-founders have left. Early VCs who got in at sub-$30 billion valuations have seen their ownership percentages compressed dramatically—even as the absolute dollar value has grown. The cap table now includes 11 funding rounds. What makes OpenAI’s story unique is who’s investing and why: Microsoft isn’t just an investor—they’re existentially dependent on OpenAI. Their entire AI strategy—Azure growth, Office Copilots, enterprise AI positioning—runs through OpenAI infrastructure. They’ll keep funding to protect that relationship. But they also receive ~20% of OpenAI’s revenue through their partnership agreement, creating a circular funding dynamic. Nvidia invested $100 million in October 2024 and gets paid back immediately through GPU purchases. They’ve invested in 50+ AI startups creating a circular economy where investment dollars flow back as compute revenue. Part of Microsoft’s and Nvidia’s investment effectively returns to their own coffers. SoftBank went from a $500 million investor in October 2024 to leading a $30 billion round six months later. That’s not normal venture behavior—that’s Masayoshi Son making a macro bet on AGI. Their commitment is so aggressive that if OpenAI doesn’t complete its for-profit conversion by December 31, 2025, SoftBank’s investment could be slashed from $30 billion to as low as $20 billion. Traditional VCs are playing a different game: raising larger funds on the AI narrative, marking up valuations in subsequent rounds, and hoping an exit materializes. But with 60+ investors on the cap table, exit dynamics will be complicated. Honestly it’s kind of based that employees will own 3x as much of OpenAI as VCs https://t.co/7MoOk6L8A1 — Luke Metro (@luke_metro) October 14, 2025 The October 2025 secondary sale is particularly revealing. OpenAI had authorized up to $10.3 billion in shares for sale but only about $6.6 billion ultimately changed hands. Why did employees sell less than authorized? Two possibilities: Either way, this was the second major secondary in a year—a clear signal that liquidity events are necessary to retain talent competing with Meta’s nine-figure offers and public company stock compensation. Here’s the structural complexity that matters: current investors still don’t own actual equity. They hold convertible notes that only convert to shares after the nonprofit-to-for-profit restructuring completes. This requires: The deadline? December 31, 2025. If the conversion fails, SoftBank’s investment drops from $30 billion to $20 billion, and other investors can demand their money back with 9% interest. That’s a potential $40+ billion liability. The OpenAI model isn’t replicable—but the dynamics are instructive: For AI infrastructure founders: If you’re building frontier models, you’re signing up for capital requirements that dwarf traditional SaaS. You’ll need to raise 4-5x your revenue run rate continuously. You might own 5-15% of something huge rather than 25% of something modest. And you’ll need to accept strategic investors who become customers, partners, and dependencies simultaneously. For AI application founders: The good news is you probably don’t need the OpenAI model. If you’re building on top of foundation models, your capital requirements are dramatically lower. But you’re also betting that OpenAI, Anthropic, or another provider maintains reasonable API pricing as they burn billions. For investors: Traditional venture math is broken in frontier AI. A 10x return on a $500 billion valuation requires a $5 trillion outcome. You’re not investing for returns—you’re investing for: To be fair, the revenue growth is real: At a $500 billion valuation on $12.7 billion revenue, that’s roughly a 39x revenue multiple. For context, Salesforce trades at 8-9x, ServiceNow at 20x. But both are profitable. The bet is that by 2029, at $100 billion in revenue, a $500 billion valuation would be 5x revenue—reasonable for a high-growth software company. But that requires executing flawlessly for four years while burning $115 billion and fending off Google, Meta, Anthropic, and everyone else building AGI. Yes, OpenAI scaled to a $500 billion valuation faster than any company in history. Yes, they’re generating $12.7 billion in revenue with 500 million weekly users. Yes, they’ve created a new market category and changed how the world thinks about AI. But they’ve also: The valuation is spectacular. The dilution is equally spectacular. The capital requirements are unprecedented. The burn rate is staggering. All of these things are true simultaneously. This is the new reality of frontier AI. Not every hot AI deal will look like this, but many infrastructure plays will require similar capital intensity. The question isn’t whether you can raise at massive valuations—OpenAI proved you can. The question is whether the dilution, complexity, and burn make sense for your business model and your exit strategy. For most AI companies, the answer is no. For foundation model companies competing for AGI, it might be the only path forward.

Title: What’s Behind The 40% Rise In META Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/14/whats-behind-the-40-rise-in-meta-stock/
Time Published: 2025-10-14T15:53:29Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. META’s stock has seen a solid 43% rise in the last six months. This growth is primarily fueled by a mix of factors, including upbeat quarterly performance and significant AI investments that boosted the core advertising business, leading to a rise in ad impressions and ad prices. Furthermore, rising user engagement across its apps contributed to investor optimism, all while the company returned capital to shareholders via $9.76 billion in share repurchases and $1.33 billion in dividend payments in Q2 alone. From a quantitative perspective, the 43% surge in Meta Platforms stock in the last six months was largely driven by a 33.5% change in the company's P/E Multiple. While there is more to this narrative than mere numbers, let's first dissect the stock price movement into its contributing factors. Investing in a single stock can be fraught with risk, but there is substantial benefit to a more diversified strategy, like the one we employ with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Additionally, think about the potential long-term performance for your portfolio if you integrated 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto alongside equities. Separately, see – What's Happening With RGTI Stock? Returning to the “change”: The alterations in fundamental aspects like valuation, revenue, and margins carry with them a narrative related to business and investor sentiment. Below, we have pinpointed significant developments that impacted the stock price movements for META stock. As a quick background: META offers products that allow users to connect and share through various devices, including mobile phones, PCs, VR headsets, wearables, and augmented reality, promoting connectivity anytime and anywhere. Opinion: Currently, we view META stock as fairly valued. Why is that the case? Take a look at the full narrative. Read Buy or Sell META Stock to understand what informs our current viewpoint. Risk: Nonetheless, META is not immune to significant declines. It dropped approximately 43% during the 2018 correction, 35% amid the Covid pandemic, and sustained a heavier blow of 77% during the inflation crisis. Despite all the positives surrounding the stock, real risks remain. When markets sour, META can still experience serious downturns. Consistently selecting winners is a challenging endeavor, particularly given the volatility linked to a single stock. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a proven record of surpassing the S&P 500 during the past 4-year period. Why is this the case? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; resulting in a steadier performance, as evidenced in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Tim Ferriss at a Career Crossroads: How Should He Shape His Next Chapter?

Full Content:
Author, podcaster, and angel investor Tim Ferriss considers what to do next to meet his career and life goals. In April 2024, writer, podcaster, and entrepreneur Tim Ferriss—known for his hugely popular podcast “The Tim Ferriss Show” and NYT-bestselling books like The 4-Hour Workweek—found himself at a crossroads. Although his podcast was generating millions annually, he questioned the sustainability of podcasting and his own competitive advantage given the increasingly saturated market and the advent of AI tools and video-centric formats. Plus, he had built his career on anticipating cultural shifts in knowledge work, health, and media consumption while making early angel investments in companies like Uber, Shopify, Facebook, and Twitter. But his podcast’s reliable cash flow also funded his science-focused foundation, so making any shifts would be very consequential. He faced a difficult choice: innovate from within his proven format, pivot to entirely new ventures—possibly in film, premium consumer products, or venture capital—or risk a slow decline by maintaining the status quo. Complicating matters further was Ferriss’s desire to start a family, a goal he prioritized above all business ventures. Every month of indecision narrowed his window for successfully transitioning. Senior Lecturer Reza Satchu and Tim Ferriss joined Cold Call host Brian Kenny to discuss the case, “Tim Ferriss: What Might This Look Like If It Were Easy?” in front of a live audience on October 7, 2025 in Harvard Business School’s Klarman Hall auditorium. Using “The Founder Mindset” framework from the course created by Satchu, they explore testing assumptions, calibrating risk, and how to choose the next path in the face of multiple options—which can often lead to inaction. BRIAN KENNY: Welcome to Cold Call, the podcast where we dive deep into the stories behind groundbreaking Harvard Business School case studies. Tim Ferriss has been called the Oprah of Audio. His podcast, the Tim Ferriss Show, surpassed a billion downloads and reshaped the digital media landscape. Yet at the height of his success, Ferriss found himself at a crossroads. With podcasting becoming a crowded competitive space, he wondered whether the medium that had defined his career was still the best vehicle for his curiosity, creativity, and impact. How should a creator who has always thrived by reinventing himself decide what’s next? Especially when personal priorities, like starting a family, collide with professional ambitions. Today, on Cold Call, I’m joined by Professor Reza Satchu and case protagonist Tim Ferriss to discuss the case, “Tim Ferriss, What Might This Look Like If It Were Easy?” I’m your host Brian Kenny, and you’re listening to a live taping of Cold Call coming to you from Klarman Hall on the campus of HBS, Harvard Business School. Make some noise, folks. All right, can we have a warm welcome for our guests? Reza Satchu teaches entrepreneurship at Harvard Business School, including the Founder Mindset and Founder Launch, both courses that he created. He is also a serial entrepreneur, having founded multiple highly successful ventures. Reza, welcome. REZA SATCHU: Thank you very much. Thanks for having us. BRIAN KENNY: Tim Ferriss, the subject of today’s case is a bestselling author, entrepreneur, speaker, and early stage investor. You may have heard that he hosts a podcast. Tim, welcome. TIM FERRISS: Thanks. Thanks for having me. Hi, everybody. BRIAN KENNY: It’s great to have you here. I’m a little nervous actually because your podcast gets a lot of listens, so I want to make sure that we do this right. TIM FERRISS: I’m sure you’ll be fine. You have a better voice for radio. We were both commenting, the intonation and delivery. I thought it was so good. I was like, man. BRIAN KENNY: Why don’t we just dive right in? Reza, I’m going to start with you. Can you tell us what drew you to Tim’s story? Why did you think it was a good subject for a case study, particularly for the Founder’s Mindset class, and what makes it particularly relevant for aspiring founders today? REZA SATCHU: Yeah, so look, I think I was thrilled. Actually, my research associate who’s here, Denise Koller, came up with the idea of interviewing Tim. Initially, I thought, “Does this make sense?” The more I got to know Tim and study his work, his mindset is exactly in sync with some of the things that we’re trying to get our founders to think about, starting with, he imagines a world that doesn’t exist today. He imagines that there are things he can do that are different than are existing today. He imagines a space where he can actually think about something, take a series of actions, trust his judgment, and hopefully build something of consequence. So many people stop at that first point, which is, how could I possibly do something different? It started really there, where I thought, “Here’s someone who has done many different things well, trusted his judgment.” Really, that’s a key part of being a founder. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. Tim, let me turn to you the case. Like any good HBS case, it opens up with you thinking pensively about what you’re going to do. You’re probably staring out a window looking at something. I’m wondering, actually, if you can take us back to where the case opens up, where you’re mulling through what your options are. You’ve got a lot of options right now and you’re thinking about what the best thing is. What was going on, what was your mindset at that time? TIM FERRISS: Yeah, I was actually literally looking out, in Austin where I recorded my podcast. I would say fundamentally it was, number one, has this become a crowded red ocean where other people can do this, what I started off doing in 2014. If there are one or more people who can do what I can do, I’m like, “Well, this seems redundant.” I would prefer to do something that is more of a category of one, to borrow from the 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing. There wasn’t a financial pressure to stop. Certainly, there was a little bit of pressure to continue because it funds the foundation, it funds the angel investing, it pays for the bills and employees and so on. But it was more a question of, is this the game I want to play? We’re all playing games past a certain point, past the lowest rungs on Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. Then, beyond that, it’s being aware of what game you’ve currently opted into, what are the rules, what are the wind conditions, the failure modes. Then, authoring something that hopefully stacks the deck in your favor. That’s a lot of what I was thinking about. The entire landscape had become too saturated. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, and so you described this in the case as blue oceans versus red oceans. Reza, if you can talk about, in the Founder Mindset framework, how does Tim’s approach to pattern recognition and assumption testing compare to other founders? REZA SATCHU: I think there’s a critically important point on Tim’s mindset, and how I think it resonates with the Founder Mindset, is people think of committing to an idea as jumping off a cliff into shark-infested waters, and that somehow being a founder is full of risk, full of uncertainty. You close your eyes and you just hope and pray for the best. Okay, I can’t tell you how flawed that is. I’m a serial founder. I will tell you I think about risk all the time. I calculate risk and I’m not paralyzed by it. The key is actually making decisions in the face of risk. What Tim does with what he calls these assumptions or these experiments, he effectively is trusting his judgment to do some things. Nothing terribly consequential, but enough to get data to figure out whether or not he should continue pursuing his curiosity. He gives himself permission to go down a pathway of his curiosity, whereas, most people never give themselves that permission because they just think, “How could I possibly have this idea when others have so many more resources?” I call it “small c commitments.” He calls it these “two-week experiments,” but it’s this idea that he’s willing to suspend disbelief that others haven’t thought of this idea, and that he’s willing to actually test his ideas and dip his toe in before he jumps in. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. Tim, for you, a lot of this began back when you wrote The 4-Hour Work Week, was that 15 years ago, give or take? TIM FERRISS: Almost 20, 2007, back when I had hair. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, that book challenged a lot of assumptions at that time. I’m wondering what assumptions you were testing as you wrote that book, and how do you weigh the risks and opportunities of coming out with something that seems a little audacious? TIM FERRISS: The first part I would say is simply asking questions that address some of the assumptions underlying traditional, let’s just call it, or conventional career planning. The deferred life plan. What would you do if you could not do that? If you could not rely on that. Which by the way is more and more relevant with some of the technologies that are coming. But if you couldn’t rely on that, exactly, as a social contract, what would you do? Then, it just led into lots of my own experiments. That was largely autobiographical. Then, teasing out the principles that allowed me to automate, and at the time use virtual assistants, that would be replaced by a lot of AI right now. That’s the first part. It was testing assumptions, but not just in a theoretical capacity. It was saying, “All right, I tried this thing, it didn’t work. I did this, it did work. I did this, it kind of worked, and here’s how I got it to really work. Here’s how you might think about dipping your toe in the water.” One critical part of that book that I think sometimes gets missed is cultivating a bias towards action. There are these exercises at the end of almost every chapter called Comfort Challenges. It’s just doing things that are very uncomfortable socially. There’s really no risk involved. This is not from the book, but my friend Noah Kagan talks about the Coffee Challenge, where people have to go in, order a coffee, and then ask for 10% off without giving any explanation, and just like, deal with that. It’s amazing. You see these people are like multiple-time founders or HBS grads, they’re pacing. They’re like, “Oh, it’s easy.” They’re pacing around the coffee shop for 30 minutes trying to build up the courage to do it. It’s like, “Yeah, that stuff helps.” From realizing that most stumbles or non-issues to begin with. In terms of presenting something that was contrarian, I first of all pitched the book. It’s a long story as to how I even got to the book, because I never wanted to write a book, but it was turned down by something like 29 publishers, violently. Some of the rejection letters were worthy of framing. Then, Steve Ross and Heather Jackson, at Crown, which was an imprint of Random House at the time, my pitch had been polished after getting rejected 29 times, literally, this is not an exaggeration. They were like, “Sure, kid. We’ll pay you pennies on the dollar to try this.” Their downside risk was very low. I had, as a younger person, I was published when I was 29, but at that time it’s like, what are your advantages? You can take stock of your advantage. At that time, it’s time, it’s speed, experimentation. You don’t have some permanent record of strikes that follows you around everywhere. I think you can afford to experiment. For me, it was ultimately an exercise in writing a book, and the only time it started to click was when I basically wrote it as I would write an email to two very particular friends after two glasses of wine. I threw out two drafts of that book, and then it unfolded, and that bought me permission to do a lot of other things. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, it worked out in the end, didn’t it? TIM FERRISS: It did work out. It’s not the end yet, so we’ll see. BRIAN KENNY: Reza, I had a chance to sit in on your class today, which was really interesting, and thank you for letting me do that. You talked a lot about failure, particularly in the beginning part of the class. What’s the Founder’s Mindset where it comes to being able to get rejected 29 times and still go back and ask for another publishing deal? REZA SATCHU: Okay, so first of all, just on failure, I think human psychology, is you often overestimate your downside, and I think to Tim’s point, you also massively underestimate your ability to recover. People imagine failure as this terrible thing that, oh my God, if this happens, it will be awful. Certainly, sitting here with the HBS students, what you’re doing is looking left and right and wondering, “Oh, my God, these people are going to think I’m a failure.” When in reality they’re barely going to think about you at all, but people are really stressed about that. I think the broader component around failure is not only do you overestimate what failure is, but by not putting yourself in positions of failure, two things don’t happen. One is you don’t learn. You don’t learn what happens through that failure. But the second thing is, I don’t know if this is what happened here, but people actually, when they look at someone who has stayed committed 29 times, I have this phrase which is like, magic happens when you commit, which is it’s not just you learn what you’re capable of. Other people show up precisely because they see the commitment. What people often misprice is that piece of the right tail upside. I think failure is a wonderful thing. I think a life without failure is a terrible life. It’s just a life where you don’t learn what you’re capable of. I think there needs to be a fundamental reframing of failure. Tim, I’d love you to talk about your concept of these one-way doors, irreversible law, like how you price risk, what does risk actually mean to you? TIM FERRISS: Yeah, I can speak to that. I also want to add something I left out of the question around The 4-Hour Work Week. There we go. I’ll let you take it. Just because people are rejecting your idea does not mean it’s a good idea. Just to state the obvious. REZA SATCHU: That’s true. TIM FERRISS: I agree with Paul Graham, Co-Founder of Y Combinator, who wrote an essay roughly around, the more labels you apply to yourself, the dumber you are. If you pride yourself on being contrarian, you’re actually just conforming to an anti-consensus. You’re actually still suffering from a really heavy form of bias. In my case, the reason I persisted through those 29 rejections was that the material that was going to be in the book, I had workshopped with, I don’t know, a thousand students at Princeton doing guest lectures at the invitation of my former professor. I had refined it, refined it like a stand-up comedian working on his 60-minute set, and I knew it worked. REZA SATCHU: Right, so you had an informational advantage. TIM FERRISS: I asked for feedback forms after every class. I had all these annoying pointed questions that students didn’t want to fill out. I knew that for a particular demographic it worked, and that’s why I persisted. If I had not had that data, I don’t think I would’ve persisted. I wouldn’t have had any grounds for plowing head in that way. Then, in terms of risk, I think there’s a lot to be said. I’m echoing Scott Galloway here, but choosing where you’re going to live and operate actually is a really important, sometimes more so than what you’re going to do. Moving to Silicon Valley was incredibly liberating because people fail all the time and they’re never counted out. I’ve invested in so many founders who failed the first time and then, boom. REZA SATCHU: Back at it. TIM FERRISS: Right? StumbleUpon, I was an advisor, didn’t work out. That was a zero for me as an advisor. But then, Garrett Camp a few months later was like, “Hey, I have this idea.” Turned it into Uber. People are never counted out. Being in an environment where that is the case matters a lot. It doesn’t have to be Silicon Valley, although that’s the most obvious. Risk for me, put simply, would be the probability of an irreversible negative outcome. There are some cases where that’s part of the calculus, but typically, I thought about making a journal. I seriously contemplated doing this because everyone’s making a journal now, but I went to the bookstore, I was like, “There are too many journals, I’m not going to do it.” But the journal was going to be called “worries that mostly didn’t happen.” It’s just like you just write down what you’re worried about and then you look back three months later, and again, none of that actually mattered. The cost of “failure” is very low for most things. You can also get a signal, positive or negative, go or no-go, pretty quickly if you’re methodical about it. I try to view, reframe failure, as scientific feedback. You have a hypothesis, you test it, it didn’t pan out, still valuable. If you’re optimizing for learning and relationships that transcend any given project, experiment, company, job, et cetera, those things snowball over time. If you’re keen on doing short-term experiments but long-term greedy, it’s very hard to lose, in my opinion. From what I’ve seen, and this is based on Silicon Valley, so it’s maybe anomalous, but it’s really hard to fail over the long term. REZA SATCHU: The amazing thing about this failure point is if you just think about two different career trajectories, one is a more traditional career trajectory. Let’s pick on consultants because, why not? There’s no real risk of failure. You’re going to get 95 things out of a hundred right on that path. On the Founder path, you are getting most things wrong. You’re asking people for money, they’re saying no. You’re asking customers to transact with you, they’re saying no. You’re trying to hire people, they’re saying no. You’ve got no resources. You’re constantly surrounded by a life of failure. You’ve just got to decide which life sounds better. What you suddenly realize is, wow, well, a life without failure, it’s hard to imagine having the impact that you all want to have, or having the return that you all want to have. I really think this point around risk really ties into failure, which is first of all, you need to reframe risk as a really great thing. Without risk, there’s no return. Risk is a good thing. It is not what you immediately think of, which is, “Oh, I want to stay away from it.” You need risk. Okay? What that doesn’t mean is that you’re jumping off a cliff. What it means is you understand how to operate in terms of risk. You need to incorporate some of the frameworks that you’ve talked about in class today to measure and calibrate it. But Tim’s not writing these books if he’s not willing to encounter risk. TIM FERRISS: Yeah, the 4-Hour Body, still recovering from some injuries from that one, 2010. Just had a surgery on this elbow as a result of that book. REZA SATCHU: Everyone must have thought that was a crazy idea. TIM FERRISS: It was crazy. But to use the 4-Hour Body as an example, the 4-Hour Work Week bought me permission to experiment outside of that lane, and so I did the 4-Hour Body in totally different category. Because the upside of that was so high if it opened the door to me writing books on any subject. The downside was that book doesn’t do well, and I go back to milking this 4-Hour, whatever the hell work week. The downside risk was very, very limited. I would also say that I think my experience with great schools, my experience with analytical people in general, is that they’re very good at thinking about all the possible downsides of doing the new thing or doing the “risky thing”. But they don’t spend as much time thinking about the cost of inaction or the status quo or taking the safe route. If you telescope out six months, a year, three years, five years, what are the emotional costs, financial, maybe relational, et cetera. It turns out when you start to look at these two options with equal weight, that the potentially safer route is just as fraught with all sort of problems as the supposedly risky route. Then, it’s like, “All right, I might as well do the weird thing first.” BRIAN KENNY: Did you ever worry about your brand though, the Tim Ferriss brand? If I do something that’s too contrarian, I may lose some of my brand cachet. TIM FERRISS: I don’t think about brand really at all, which isn’t to fault anyone who does, but I think brand is one of those words that can be a siren song for lots of decisions that compromise. I don’t want to say necessarily integrity and values, although it can be that, but you can be captured by, in my case, like an audience who rewards you for your most outlandish comments. If you follow that incentive structure on something like YouTube, you can wear a mask for so long that you become that mask. I’ve seen that happen to people, and you can’t hit control Z on that very easily, so I don’t think about brand. I pay a lot of attention to truly following my curiosity. When I do say a six, I do these two week experiments, but they’re generally within the context of a six to 12-month project. When I’m in that six to 12-month project, I am all in. I am completely saturated in it. I just find that there are a lot of ways to approach this. There’s no one way for everybody, but most of the hiccups along the way are just little toe stubs. But you have to get used to taking the hits. In other words, it’s like, if you were to go to a boxing class and you’ve never done boxing before and you get hit in the liver with a punch, it’s not even a hard punch. It’s going to be really shocking and unpleasant. If you do it for six months, you’ll be like, “Okay, yeah, I’m going to get 50 of these today. It’s fine.” You get over it, but you have to train your immune response, your stress response to this stuff. The only way to do that is by getting out there and trying stuff. REZA SATCHU: Brian, this is what’s so valuable to Founders, is exactly this, which is what they’re getting is hit all the time, but they’re learning that they can recover much faster through those hits. TIM FERRISS: Yeah. Could I add one more thing? REZA SATCHU: Yeah, of course. TIM FERRISS: I’ll give you an example. I remember the first time that I got, sadly, this is just a tax in the US, my first frivolous lawsuit, I got sued by somebody who was completely, it’s laughably ridiculous. I was so stressed out, I couldn’t sleep, and my publisher was involved, all this craziness. It was filed by the law firm that sued Subway for having 11 and a half inch foot long subs. So I’m dealing with all this and it’s tearing me up inside. Then, I was having a conversation with this friend of mine who’s been on multiple public boards. He’s in private equity for a super long time, very, very good investor. He’s like, “What?” He’s like, “This is the first time you’ve been sued.” He’s like, “I should sue you.” He’s like, “Welcome to the club.” He’s like, “What are you so upset about?” I was like, “What are you talking about?” I tried to justify it, and he’s like, “Ah. It’s fine.” I was like, “Oh, okay.” You just realize that a lot of the things you might contemplate now that you think are very big, huge problems, you can fix. A lot of it is just par for the course. REZA SATCHU: What do you think of this right to recover or what do you think human psychology is around recovery? Do people underestimate or overestimate their ability to recover? TIM FERRISS: I think it depends a lot on who you’re talking to, right? It’s like, if we’re talking to a bunch of refugees who had made hard choices. Then, I would say they probably accurately estimate their adaptiveness. REZA SATCHU: Ability. Yeah. TIM FERRISS: Their ability to adapt. I would say people who have, and this was me for a long time, executed to plan in a system where the rules are known, it’s more or less complete information, like higher education. It’s like, “Okay, great, you’re on the dean’s list, you’re summa cum laude, or whatever.” That those people underestimate their resilience, but I don’t actually think they’re wrong, because to develop the resilience you have to build some scar tissue. The only way you do that is by getting on the field. This sounds all abstract. It’s like, “No, okay, you want to change the world and build a billion-dollar company doing X?” It’s like, “All right, go talk to 10, go pitch 10 customers next week and ask them for money. As a dry run to get prepayment that will fund X, Y, or Z.” But don’t hide, and then I’m quoting Seth Godin, “But don’t hide behind the big.” Get out there and it’s going to be messy. BRIAN KENNY: Reza, I want to talk, so much of the case centers around optionality and all the options that Tim had in front of him, we talked about that a little bit upfront. I’m wondering, once you’ve achieved a certain level of success, a lot of opportunities open up. As a Founder, how do you sort through that? How do you think about what’s worth pursuing, what you shouldn’t pursue? What’s the thought process there? REZA SATCHU: Yeah, so it’s interesting. In my life, as someone who’s founded a few businesses, in some ways, the most recent businesses are harder, surprisingly. One would say, “Well, it’s easier because you’ve got more resources, more expertise, you have less hunger, and you have much more options. It’s not as critical that it has to succeed.” I teach and I found a business at the same time. That’s crazy. Most people would say that is not an optimal way to found a business. Whereas, my first couple of businesses, there’s no way I’d be teaching and founding a business. I’d be fully focused on founding. I think this idea that it gets easier, it might get easier from an expertise perspective, but suddenly you’ve got what I call the curse of optionality, which is you’ve got a number, and Tim, you’re facing some of this right now, frankly, this paradox of choice, which is precisely because of the success you’ve had you’ve got a whole bunch of choices. He mentioned Seth Godin, who’s a wonderful writer, who we interviewed for the case, and he said to Denise and me that we need to lock Tim in a room or in a cabin, and he needs to pick an option. Of course, what he was saying was that the world will be a much better place if Tim commits to something. As opposed to maximizing all of his options. I do think this curse, and for the students, people listening, I think that many of you will fall into this trap of preserving options for far too long and not knowing what you’re capable of when you commit. I’ve not had money and I’ve had money. Not having money is somewhat liberating because you just know what you need to do. When you have options, and those options could be a Harvard Business School degree, you suddenly start thinking, “Well, maybe I can preserve those options for a very long time.” I’m curious, Tim, I would ask you this question, which is you’ve got a whole bunch of options ahead of you. Here’s what I know to be true, is if you committed to one, I’m sure it will be far more impactful than if you preserve all of them. TIM FERRISS: Yeah, that’s true. I agree with that, but I would also say a few things. Number one is that you can validate or invalidate something really quickly. We were talking about this a bit earlier, but I was chatting with a student who was talking about maybe the safer route to finance and then less safe perhaps in entertainment, film potentially. I was saying, I’m saying, “All right, you know what’s going to really get attention, is if you’re an HBS grad who offers to shadow a show runner or a producer in pre-production on a movie, and you’re like, “Nothing is beneath me. Cleaning toilets, getting your coffee, I don’t care.'” It’s like, “All I want to do is observe some deal making and see what goes into making a film.” It’s like, “You can figure out if that is actually your dream or not very, very quickly. You might be completely allergic to it, but you can figure that out after a week of being in the pre-production office.” That’s number one. REZA SATCHU: But are you also suggesting that because that’s a differentiator, meaning, there’s something that it says about you, that you’re willing to do that? TIM FERRISS: Here’s my experience. Even though you might feel there’s very little time and a big rush, there’s not a big rush. You can take time to have these little detours and try things. The second is that even though I’m doing some different things, let’s just say angel investing newsletter foundation focused on mental health therapeutics, nonprofit, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. There’s actually a way in which they reinforce one another. I will use, say, the podcast to interview scientists based on science I’m interested in to determine if I think they’re a good candidate for the foundation, or potentially, it doesn’t have to be a scientist. If I find that their personality is compatible enough and their idea is compelling enough that I want to make an investment in their company. I can use that as a discovery mechanism then for sourcing. I would say, also it depends on how much… Preserving all of your options also is just an illusion. You can’t really do that. The nature of making a decision, it’s like incision, decision to cut away. You are by definition cutting off a lot of paths, which I do for six to 12 months at a time. But you can have a few things, in my case, running at the same time in parallel. I would say optionality might not be all you think it is. If I look at hundreds of people I’ve interviewed on the podcast who are by any measure top performers in their fields, one of the most common comments or concepts that comes up is the power of positive constraints. Positive constraints, commit. It doesn’t have to be commit forever. It shouldn’t probably be commit forever, unless you’re the person who knows at age five that you want to do X. If you’re that, I don’t know, maybe you wouldn’t be here. REZA SATCHU: Positive constraints means cutting off options, in some sense? TIM FERRISS: It means cutting off options, or it could be anything. If you’re writing, it could be a space or page constraint. It could be, I have to write this all in third person or first person. REZA SATCHU: Well, it’s also your comment around, if I’ve got a problem, I will only solve it by taking something away. TIM FERRISS: Right, so in the case of the podcast, I found myself starting to drag my feet because it’s a very saturated marketplace. One of my key advantages that I had early on, besides just starting pretty early in 2014, was my research and the ability that I had to dig and find things that were interesting. Now, you can go in ChatGPT and say, “Give me 10 questions in the style of Tim Ferriss or Lex Friedman or Joe Rogan interviewing this person.” Boom, you’ll get good answers. That advantage has effectively disappeared, and there are a lot of ways to potentially respond to that. But for me, number one, I’m generally not looking for the cutting edge. I’m looking for dull edge. I want to see some proof of concept before I do angel investing or before I do some hare-brained thing, like make a card game, which some of you may have or not. That’s sitting up at the top for anybody who wants a copy. I think that fundamentally a lot of it comes down to asking yourself, how do you maximize for… I know this is, again, it’s so simple, but if you maximize for learning and relationships that transcend whatever that single project or job is, this is particularly effective if you are in a place like San Francisco. I don’t want to sell San Francisco. It’s pretty dirty and filthy. But I think if you were going to choose projects and you decided as a thought exercise to rank order the parameters as who, like who am I directly observing and working with? Then, where, and then what/sector, that actually comes last, I think you could end up with some pretty interesting options on the menu. BRIAN KENNY: We haven’t talked about impact, but I know that’s an important part of the thing that you cover in Founder’s Mindset. Can you talk a little bit about the idea of thinking about impact at the outset and not at the end of the journey? REZA SATCHU: I think so many people fall into this trap. I think I fell into this trap early in my career, which is my life is going to be in these stages. The impact stage will be that last piece of my life when I’ve learned a lot, when I’ve had the benefit of resources, all these sorts of things. The problem is there’s two problems. One is you may or may not be around for that last piece. BRIAN KENNY: Never know. REZA SATCHU: But the second point is it turns out that actually having impact along the way, and I love the way you describe it, which is start with the small things. Start with the people in your life that you’re… We all have these, especially here, have these visions of grandeur around having massive impact. Well, I’d say the most important way to do that is to actually start living a life of impact right away and on the small things. I think that, Tim, when you talk about, so what I view learning, what I view learning as, because a lot of people talk about you want to maximize learning, which I completely agree, and I’d be curious how you define learning. Okay, so I’m going to propose what my definition of learning is, and you tell me whether this, because I think it’s an important concept because learning is… If you had to say, what is the thing that is going to most correlate with impact, it would be learning. He who learns, he or she who learns the most is going to attract the most credibility, resources such that they can have the impact that they most desperately want. I define learning in the age of AI as the spot where you’re making… it’s all about decision making. Meaning, the trait we are most trying to learn is judgment. Judgment occurs when you’re making consequential decisions that you’re accountable for. You must live a life where you’re pushing yourself to make decisions, some of which will be wrong, some of which will be right, in order to build the thing we most want, which is judgment. Okay, so I’m curious to know your thoughts about that. TIM FERRISS: Learning, there’s how to learn, and then there’s what to learn. If you’re looking at say, who to work with, and then the where, and then the what, right? There are certain skills that are not going to transfer. It’s like, okay, if you’re in the waste management business and you’re understanding the ins and outs of waste management, I’m just making that up because I like unsexy stuff, that may not transfer to your hot shot AI startup for whatever, customer service. But if you are observing, this is an old school example, like a Wayne Huizenga. REZA SATCHU: Yeah, Wayne Huizenga. They don’t know who Wayne Huizenga is. TIM FERRISS: I know. REZA SATCHU: You and I know who Wayne Huizenga is. TIM FERRISS: I know, waste management, then Blockbuster, which went extinct back in the Pleistocene era, but that guy was a master deal maker. If you’re able to watch someone acquiring dozens and dozens of companies, and how that entire dance is woven, that transfers. If you’re learning how to communicate, let’s just say, I’m making this up, you work for Cards Against Humanity. This is a very popular game as some of you may know, they were really, really good at PR stunts. If you work at that company when it is small and you’re involved with all of those PR stunts, which fundamentally are thinking about positioning and differentiation, that will apply to everything. It’s just asking yourself, where could this transfer? Where could this apply? Then, that’s the stuff that you focus on. For me, it’s in a sense meta skills, that if you were to copy and paste, you take somebody, look, it doesn’t matter. Well, I’ll give you actually maybe a more contemporary example, like Jeff Bezos. All right. What is Jeff Bezos’ superpower? I would say that it is having longer time horizons than almost everybody else, and defending and justifying and reiterating that in every shareholder letter. He trained Wall Street like a domesticated puppy, like a puppy. REZA SATCHU: From day one, yeah. TIM FERRISS: Talk about just incredible persuasion and the pro sleight of hand and also just business mastery. But the point is, if you have a longer time horizon than other people, that’s a huge competitive advantage also in and of itself. If you can be around someone who exemplifies that, because I can say that, and you’re like, “Okay, I got it.” But it’s like, do you really? You need to see how that is emphasized over and over again. Or, like a Herb Kelleher at Southwest. Would I have loved to have worked for that guy? Would I have quit my tech job to work for him? Absolutely, because such a maniacal focus on being the low cost airline. I remember he was interviewed at one point and he said to the journalists, because they were saying how hard it was, what he did, and he’s like, “No, you can do my job.” Then, he’s like, “All right, give me a situation.” They gave him a situation. He’s like, “All right, does that help us to be the low cost airline or not?” They’re like, “No.” He’s like, “Yeah, that’s a no.” He’s like, “Okay, next one.” He’s like, “Yeah.” If you have the focus, but you need to be around people who are doing that and living it so you can see it in different contexts. This is going to sound bizarre because I’m thinking about adopting another dog. But there’s an expression in dog training, which is basically if the dog hasn’t done it, say a behavior, shaping a behavior in 20 different locations, 20 different durations, they don’t have that behavior. It’s not durable. Humans are the same. It’s conditioning. Having the opportunity to work with someone where you see certain characteristics exemplified; certain behaviors, certain principles enacted that can be applied to different businesses, man, I think that’s an incredible shortcut. But you and I have different perspectives on this. I think working for a startup’s a fantastic way to learn on someone else’s dime with the understanding that- BRIAN KENNY: That’s our youngest audience member, by the way. TIM FERRISS: Yeah. Start them young. Start them young. REZA SATCHU: It’s true. What I’d say, I think just, look, I think the question is, in the age of AI, what are the traits that we can teach people? I think that the challenge is that things like memorization and observation are far less valuable. What is valuable is this elusive thing called judgment. The real question is, how do we get it? I think, yeah, you can get it by watching someone else, but how you really get it is by doing it yourself. Actually being in the arena, making those decisions. One of the things you said, Tim, which is very interesting to me, because I have a similar phrase, when you said you have a bias for action. I have a phrase which is, if in doubt, act, which immediately people say, “Well, wait, Reza, you don’t know what you’re doing, you’re going to act?” No, the reason I say that is because so many people are paralyzed by imperfect or uncertain information, and so they’re like deer in headlights. What I suggest is, even if you’re going to stay the course, train yourself to make a decision that you’re actually staying the course, which is a bias for action. I’m curious how you think about, bias for action is, it feels risky. I’m curious how you view that. TIM FERRISS: What I would say is I have a tendency… My mom literally got me a shirt that says, ”Wait a second, let me overthink this.” My tendency is to, I don’t want to say perseverate, but over consider the ramifications of a lot of decisions. It’s been a practice of conditioning myself to be like, all right, what if I tried what Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn and so on has done, where he wants to enable his chief of staff to act quickly enough that they roughly get things wrong 10% of the time. That’s literally a guideline that he uses with his chief of staff. He says 10% footfall, which is a little confusing because it’s a tennis reference. Anyway, but I think applying that to your own life where you’re like, all right, what can I put on automatic, just no decision autopilot default, number one, where can I just completely remove decisions? Sometimes that’s with diet, exercise. You don’t want to get up in the morning and decide which of 20 toothpaste tubes you’re going to use. You have your toothpaste and you just deal with your toothpaste. Similarly, you could extrapolate that and apply it to giving employees autonomous decision-making power and creating a culture where you actually reward screw-ups. I literally met with, I was having a blood draw this morning because I’m in Boston for proteomics assay. Anyway, it’s a long story. But they have a dedicated discord within the company for celebrating bleep-ups basically. That are not egregious. It’s also like, all right, how do we not do this again? But people get rewarded for ambition, mistakes of ambition, not mistakes of sloth, which is straight from Machiavelli, so I’m not sure how I feel about that. But in any case, I don’t know about also… I got stuck on the AI stuff again, because I don’t know, I wish I could give everybody and myself a strategy for making yourself AI proof. I don’t know what that looks like. I think though you can make a decision about, am I going to use these tools or am I going to stick my head in the sand and try to find a way around them? I think probably the way to go for it is spend your evenings for two weeks vibe coding and messing around with AI, so that you have some idea of how you might utilize it. Because within two or three years, we’re going to have multi-billion dollar companies or billion-dollar companies with one to three employees, I’m very confident in that. They’ll just use agents to fill a lot of roles, like CFO and so on. People are already doing this. I wouldn’t get too hung up on that. Although I would say, if I were to play the counterpoint, that the soft skills that I was mentioning earlier, negotiating, deal-making, this is a very intrinsically human interaction. REZA SATCHU: Human thing. TIM FERRISS: It’s very rare that you’re just going to be able to send pitch emails with the deal structure and you’re like, “Yes or no, thumbs up?” With this emoticon based on my AI chatbot, like, “Great. Let’s do a deal.” Typically, not how it works, especially as the stakes get bigger, which don’t mean they’re huge, that they’re just consequential for whoever you’re dealing with. That stuff I don’t see going away anytime soon. BRIAN KENNY: I want to give time. We’re coming close to the end of our time. I’ve got one more question for each of you, but before we do that, Tim, maybe you want to tell people about your latest venture? Because I think there are some takeaways, some giveaway items. TIM FERRISS: Yeah, if people want, so this is a very off menu thing. BRIAN KENNY: It’s just like the Oprah Show. You’re going to get something to take with you. TIM FERRISS: Yeah, exactly. It’s not a car, but it’s something else. I ended up collaborating with this guy, Elan Lee, who’s one of the world’s best game designers for the last two years to create a card game for off-screen social interaction. That’s my current project, is a card game of all things. I could explain why I chose that, but the biggest one was the who. This Elan Lee, where I was like, “I would pay to just hang out with this guy.” He’s such a soulful, deep thinker, who’s ethical and also happens to be a polymath, top 1% in multiple fields. I was like, “I just want to steep myself in whatever magic juju this guy has.” That’s how fundamentally I made the decision. Yeah, there are games up there, it’s called COYOTE. Then, beyond that, I do have an 800-page draft of a book. That’s not an overstatement. I’ll be whittling that down over the next six months probably. That’s been like eight years in the making. It’s been sitting back there for a long time. There’s other stuff going on. BRIAN KENNY: That’s awesome. Now, this has been a great conversation. I knew it would be. I was so excited to do this today. Before I let you go, I’ll ask the same question of each of you, and I’ll start with you, Tim, and I always give the professor the last word because it’s Harvard Business School, but it’s a pretty simple question. TIM FERRISS: Reza is pretty good at getting the last word anyway. BRIAN KENNY: I think that’s true. REZA SATCHU: That’s true. That is definitely BRIAN KENNY: If you just think about the case, you’ve lived it, what lessons do you think emerging founders should take from the case about navigating similar inflection points in their own journey? TIM FERRISS: Let’s see. I’m going to give credit to a mentor of mine named Ed Zschau. He was a professor of mine at Princeton, taught really the first entrepreneurship class that I’m aware of, “High-tech Entrepreneurship,” ELE 491. Still have all my notes from the class. He used to teach at HBS and then jump-started this entrepreneurship program at Princeton. He was congressman from Silicon Valley, former competitive figure skater, took a couple of companies public. Was one of the first, if not the first computer science teacher at Stanford, even though he had no computer science background. It was like somebody else dropped out and they’re like, “Can anybody else teach this class? He was like, “Oh, I’ll figure it out.” Back in the day. In his last class, I think I’m getting the name of this song right, but he actually gets up and he sings this song. I’m going to do it my way. The whole point is everybody’s making up everything by and large. There is no one right way to do it. I think that what I would hope people to take from my very bizarre case study, and I say that, I couldn’t have been prouder and happier with how everybody put it together, Denise and Reza and so on, is that you don’t have to follow the prescription, whatever the prescription is. You don’t have to meet the expectations, whatever the expectations are. You just don’t have to do it. There are a lot of ways to improvise and zig and zag. As long as you’re not too calcified around what you consider your identity. You just have to be really careful with painting yourself into a corner with that. That’s what I would hope people to take from it, is just there is a lot of room to improvise and maneuver. People ask me a lot, for instance, I’ve done these 800 plus interviews on the podcast, and they’re like, “What are the commonalities?” I’m like, “The greatest commonality is there are no commonalities.” It’s like for every incredible writer who gives me one set of advice, I sit in front of the screen, even if it’s blank for 10 hours a day, chained myself to the desk. To, B.J. Novak of The Office and movies and all sorts of stuff, he was like, “Yeah, I really need to get into the mood.” It’s like, “I’ll have my cappuccino, I’ll read the paper, I’ll do this thing. I really need to be in the right state to write.” They’re both doing amazing jobs, and they have diametrically opposing advice, which means you can figure out what rules and what stories work for you. I would just say mess around. You have your whole life to be safe and conservative and not politically. You get the idea. Like color within the lines. I guess you could have the rest of your life to be conservative too politically. But the point is, there will never, in my opinion, be a better time for you guys coming out of HBS to just embrace your weird self and try some of the stuff that is going to get harder to do later. REZA SATCHU: Look, I think that’s extremely well said. Tim, when we wrote this case study, in some ways it’s probably the longest case study because he’s got so many things going on. My students are probably like, “This is a 20-plus page story.” It’s everything from dancing, to an author, to podcasts, to all sorts of things. If I had to summarize it, I’d want two takeaways. One is, live a life full of curiosity and allow yourself to explore the things that you’re curious with. Whether that’s these experiments, small C commitments, just suspend disbelief and trust your judgment to actually explore things that you’re curious in. The upside is far greater than the downside. That’s the first point. The second point is, I really think Tim’s risk framework is very interesting. In some ways you hear a story and you immediately think, “Well, this guy is embracing risk at every turn.” It’s actually the opposite. He understands that he has to live a life with risk, but he’s actually thinking really hard about how to calibrate it. The way he does that is by actually understanding that his downside is nowhere near as bad as we all think it is. It’s defining his fears, which allows him to hopefully do something extraordinary because he’s shifting what the outcome could be. I think that is really, I would say those are, trust your curiosity and embrace risk, but calibrate it appropriately and understand that, especially coming out of a school like Harvard, your downside is nowhere near as bad as you think it is. TIM FERRISS: I’d love to add just a few things real quick. The risk mitigation stuff and thinking about that, if people are interested, I wrote these a long time ago, but it’s a two-part blog post series called How, I think it’s just “How I Created a Real World MBA.” Related to how I tiptoed my way into angel investing. REZA SATCHU: Well, this is your angel investing. TIM FERRISS: I think that’s worth, I think people in this room might find that an interesting read. The second is really study the outliers. Because if anyone has done it, there is the possibility that you could also do it or chart your own path. A book that you might not expect, it’s one called The Art of Possibility, I think the author’s last name, it’s by a husband and wife duo, Zander, Z-A-N-D-E-R. It’s very fast read, amazing book. There are a lot of book recommendations I could give, but that’s a fast one that I would encourage people to check out. Really study the outliers, like Yvon Chouinard, the early chapters, the early chapters, or if you think of someone who’s a risk-taker, like Richard Branson, read Losing My Virginity. It’s like at every turn that guy is hedging risk and minimizing and mitigating risk. It’s remarkable how good he is at capping downside. I would just say, study the outliers. There are a lot of ways to tiptoe into things to figure out a signal very, very quickly at low cost. BRIAN KENNY: I think that’s a good note to end on.

Title: Stock market ‘concentration risk’ now higher than dot-com bubble period, IMF warns

Time Published: 2025-10-14T14:15:00Z
Full Content:
Market valuations have “become stretched”, increasing the probably of a “disorderly correction”, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned. In its latest Global Financial Stability update, published alongside its half-year report on the global economy, the Washington-based fund highlights the concentration risk within the US’s S&P 500 index from the so-called magnificent seven stocks (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Tesla and Nvidia). It noted that the information technology sector accounted for a weight of 35 per cent of the total S&P 500, similar to during the dot-com bubble of the 1990s, but this time just seven stocks accounted for 33 per cent of the index. That meant the concentration risk “was now substantially higher than during the dot-com bubble”. Many analysts believe stock markets, particularly in the US, are on the brink of major negative correction following an investment glut in artificial intelligence (AI). AI-related companies have accounted for around 80 per cent of US stock market gains this year. [ Negative impact of tariffs starting to show, IMF warnsOpens in new window ] In its report, the IMF said the rebound in global equity prices since US president Donald Trump’s April tariff announcement had outpaced expected future earnings. Despite recent economic data trending negative, markets appear to be downplaying the potential effects of US tariffs on growth and inflation, it said. Global financial markets “have largely brushed off subsequent shocks and uncertainties,” it said, noting financial conditions across most regions have eased back to “accommodative levels”. But it warned “the apparent calm masks a degree of complacency.” “Despite trade tensions, geopolitical uncertainties, and rising concerns about sovereign indebtedness, asset prices have returned to stretched valuations and financial conditions have broadly eased,” it said. “Against substantial AI-related investments, the possibility of mega-cap stocks failing to generate expected returns to justify current lofty equity valuations could trigger deterioration in investor sentiment and make the stocks susceptible to sudden, sharp correction,” the IMF said. An analysis of sovereign bond markets also highlighted “growing pressure from widening fiscal deficits on the functioning of markets,” it said. [ Why is the US economy so much stronger than Europe’s?Opens in new window ] In advanced economies, sovereign bond markets are increasingly dependent on price-sensitive investors, it said. “Stress in core bond markets, although a tail risk, could have broad and disruptive ramifications for financial markets, given bonds’ role as key benchmarks and collateral,” it said. In its report, the IMF also highlighted the weakness of the US dollar “Overall, the dollar has depreciated by about 10 per cent so far this year against major currencies,” it said. “Analysts have put forth a number of possible drivers for dollar weakness, from a revaluation of dollar strength amid concerns over the US fiscal position to a shift in allocation away from US-dollar-denominated assets driven by concerns about US policy uncertainty,” it said.

The message was tucked inside K. Krithivasan’s prepared remarks, in a recent media release. India’s largest IT services exporter, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the company Krithivasan now heads, is preparing for the biggest gamble of its five-decade existence: a massive $6.5 billion investment over six years to forge one gigawatt (GW) of new data centre capacity. Consider the sheer scale of ambition for a moment: This planned capacity alone is enough to match India’s entire current data centre base within six years, and the capital expenditure eclipses the combined value of all TCS acquisitions over the last two decades. That ambition also underlies a tectonic shift within TCS. For decades, the company exported code and consultancy, intangible services that powered global enterprises but left few physical footprints at home. Now, it is choosing to pour billions into concrete, steel and copper. The country’s most profitable IT exporter is turning inward, betting that India’s artificial intelligence (AI) revolution would need not just algorithms, but infrastructure. That shift is particularly striking given the group’s own history. Back in 2016, another Tata company, Tata Communications, effectively jettisoned its data centre play, deeming it “non-core." The sister concern sold 74% stake in its data centre business to a Temasek Holdings unit for $634 million. Three of those data centres were in Singapore; the rest across India. By last year, Tata Communications had divested its remaining 26%. Under chairman Cyrus Mistry, it seemed the group had moved on from the brick-and-mortar complexities of digital infrastructure. Under N. Chandrasekaran—the man who once put TCS on a high growth orbit—the pendulum has violently swung back. So when Krithivasan—himself a quiet engineer who inherited the corner office after Rajesh Gopinathan’s abrupt exit in 2023—outlined this unprecedented investment, it was more than a capex announcement. It signalled a philosophical reversal within the Tata ecosystem, a return to building the physical foundations of digital India. “The Tata Group companies are in power, real estate, project management businesses…So, there is a different kind of synergy we can build in here," Krithivasan said, during a call with analysts on 9 October. The timing, though, came against an uneasy backdrop. Ahead of TCS’s latest earnings, on 9 October, its stock was languishing near a 52-week low. Growth was tapering. Analysts at Motilal Oswal and Nuvama projected a full-year revenue decline—the first since TCS’s 2004 listing. The mood across India’s $283-billion IT industry was sombre. Global clients were trimming technology budgets, US visa restrictions had upended the traditional onsite-offshore model, and TCS had just confirmed the layoff of over 6,000 employees in the September quarter. In this subdued climate, the $6.5 billion commitment stood out as an act of economic courage, an attempt to reimagine TCS’s future rather than merely defend its margins. TCS did not respond to Mint’s detailed questionnaire seeking comments. April at the TajThe idea took shape earlier this year. In April, Chandrasekaran, who has been steadily integrating the Tata empire into a digital-industrial group, asked senior TCS executives to explore the data centre opportunity. It was a directive rooted in strategic timing as much as necessity. The same month, at a high-profile event in Delhi’s Taj Mansingh Hotel, TCS unveiled its ‘sovereign cloud network’, a service designed to store and process data entirely within Indian borders in compliance with new data-localization rules. It was a logical extension of TCS’s IT services portfolio: the company already provided engineers, managed IT infrastructure, and offered private cloud services. What it lacked was real estate—the physical layer of computing power that anchored the digital world. View Full Image In April this year, TCS unveiled its sovereign cloud network. (iStockphoto) That gap is precisely what the new investment aims to close. Data centres are the factories of the AI age—vast, secure facilities that house the servers, networking equipment and cooling systems needed to process and store the petabytes of data generated every day. India’s regulatory mandates and digital explosion have created a perfect storm of demand. The Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, now requires payment data to be stored domestically; the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the markets regulator, has similar stipulations for market participants. As 5G networks roll out and connected devices multiply, the volume of data produced by consumers, vehicles, and industrial systems is surging. Add the rise of generative AI, and the need for high-speed computing infrastructure becomes existential. TCS believes it can monetize this infrastructure in two ways: leasing capacity to hyperscalers such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure, and using it for its own contracts with governments and enterprises. The company’s first 150 MW facility, to be built at a cost of $1 billion, is expected to go live within 18 months. Different from AccentureThe move also marks a clear break from how TCS’s global peers have evolved. Accenture, the $70-billion consulting giant, has doubled down on advisory-led AI and analytics rather than infrastructure. Its bet is that the profits lie in algorithms, not assets. Indian peers like Infosys and HCL Tech have largely taken the same path, positioning themselves as service orchestrators on top of third-party cloud platforms. On 13 October, HCL Tech announced that it had won $100 million in revenue from AI operations in the September quarter, making the Noida-based company the first among Big Five to quantify revenue from AI technologies. TCS, by contrast, is wading into the physical side of that digital stack. It is a high-stakes pivot that could recast its risk profile and profit structure. “The beauty of the data centre business is its recurring stability," said one executive familiar with the plan. “But it will test patience before delivering cash returns." The executive did not want to be identified. Dividend resetThe patience required may be considerable. Unlike software projects, data centres are capital-intensive, slow to scale and operationally demanding. TCS’s decision to build rather than rent puts it in competition with hyperscalers and domestic real-estate developers alike. The company is entering a field already crowded with global giants—Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon—as well as Indian powerhouses such as Reliance, AdaniConnex and Yotta. The irony is that, given its scale and client relationships, TCS should have been a natural candidate to own data centres years ago. Instead, it spent two decades returning wealth to shareholders— ₹3.66 trillion through dividends and buybacks since its listing. That generosity may now come at a cost. With the new investment cycle, margins could tighten, and dividend payouts to parent Tata Sons may moderate. Last year, TCS contributed 83% of Tata Sons’ income. Data centres can be bracketed into four types. First, there are the enterprise data centres, which are facilities owned and run by companies and houses their computing networks. A second category is hyperscale data centres, also known as Cloud data centres. Amazon and Microsoft own and manage these facilities. Edge data centres are the third category. Here, smaller facilities are set up closer to an organization, thereby improving speed, and are essential for real-time data processing tasks. Finally, there are the colocation data centres, a space TCS is venturing into. In this category, the data centre owner sets up the physical infrastructure, manages the facility, oversees the building, power, and cooling for the servers. The customer supplies and manages their equipment. View Full Image TCS is venturing into what is known as colocation data centres. McKinsey, a consulting firm, states that colocation data centres operate at lower profitability than cloud data centres. This is because the hyperscalers, who are the primary customers of colocation data centres, can negotiate better prices since they also set up and have their own facilities. The operating margins of Equinix and Sify, who run colocation data centres, are in the range of 22% and 19%, respectively. In comparison, the operating margins enjoyed by AWS and Azure are significantly higher, at 35-37%. Executives say TCS’s balance sheet can absorb the shock. The company generated ₹46,449 crore in free cash flow last year, more than enough to underwrite the initial phases. Yet investors accustomed to industry-leading operating margins (TCS ended with 24.3% in operating margin last year) may need to reset expectations. The stock’s 3.5% dip in three days following the announcement suggests the market is already doing so. “TCS management stated that each 150-megawatt build-out phase of the data centre will require $1 billion capex, for a $6.5 billion total investment. We think this direction could offer new potential revenue streams though could negatively impact margins," Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 9 October. McKinsey states that colocation data centres operate at lower profitability than cloud data centres. This is because the hyperscalers, who are the primary customers of colocation data centres, can negotiate better prices. Returns are slow, and could take a decade. In addition, technology cycles move faster than depreciation schedules. “This is an asset-intensive industry where labour-arbitrage advantages don’t translate," said Peter Bendor-Samuel of Everest Group, a research firm. “Investors used to high-margin, low-capex returns will need to recalibrate." Analysts at JM Financial estimated revenue from 1MW of operational data centres in the first year to be about ₹22 crore. TCS’s target of having a 150 MW data centre operational by April 2027 implies an incremental business of ₹3,300 crore. A successful operational capacity of 1 GW in six years would translate to about ₹22,000 crore, similar to its India revenue of ₹21,958 crore last year. The 3% problemThe deeper question is why TCS waited until now. For years, Indian conglomerates like Reliance and Adani have been laying the groundwork for data centre dominance, tying these projects to their energy and telecom networks. The global hyperscalers, meanwhile, have been expanding capacity across India as part of their global grids. The Tatas, cautious and conservative, stayed on the sidelines. Part of that hesitation stemmed from perception. Data centres were once viewed less as cutting-edge technology and more as glorified real-estate plays—capital-heavy, regulatory-ridden, and operationally messy. They required land, reliable electricity, and long-term financing, all of which had tripped up the Tata Group before. For a company built on intellectual capital, the business felt foreign. What has changed is the scale of the opportunity. India today accounts for roughly 20% of global data generation but only about 3% of storage capacity. Its total installed capacity—around one GW—is precisely what TCS aims to build by 2030. Analysts at Cushman & Wakefield estimate that India’s data centre capacity will triple to 1,825 megawatt (MW) by 2027, driven by new data-localization rules and the country’s voracious digital appetite. States are competing fiercely for investment. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Telangana are offering everything from electricity-duty waivers to land subsidies of up to 50%. Mumbai, with undersea cable landings and strong power grids, remains the favoured hub, but smaller cities are emerging as contenders. For TCS, whose domestic revenue still accounts for less than 10% of its total ($30.18 billion) but grew 62% last year—largely due to a ₹1.5-billion BSNL contract—the timing aligns with a broader strategic shift toward India-focused business. As global clients hesitate, India’s digital infrastructure push offers both stability and scale. The orchestraMeanwhile, the data centre gamble will not only test TCS’s financial muscle but execution capability as well. Building and operating data centres demands coordination across engineering, real estate, power management, and cybersecurity—far removed from writing code. Yet, this is where the Tata Group’s breadth could become a decisive advantage. TCS can draw on group companies such as Tata Power, Tata Communications, Nelco, and Tata Electronics for power supply, network connectivity, satellite links, and chip technology. That’s a web of synergies that rivals like Infosys or Wipro simply cannot replicate. “TCS has a unique opportunity to serve the broader Tata Group across businesses in telecom, networks, energy and cooling solutions," said Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, partner at Catalincs, a consulting firm. “It can cross leverage these capabilities across the conglomerate structure, something that other large IT companies don’t have." TCS can draw on group companies such as Tata Power, Tata Communications, Nelco, and Tata Electronics for power supply, network connectivity, satellite links, and chip technology. That’s a web of synergies. Still, competition will be fierce. To find its niche, TCS must differentiate not by sheer size but by integration—offering clients a seamless bridge between the data centre and the AI workloads that run on it. “TCS is not trying to compete with AWS or Azure on a raw scale," said Phil Fersht, chief executive of HFS Research, a consulting firm. “It’s trying to own the intersection of infrastructure and services—both the data centre and the AI models that sit on top. That’s where the value will lie." Such integration could also help TCS reposition itself in the eyes of investors. Global data centre operators like Equinix and Digital Realty command enterprise-value multiples of 20 to 22 times Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), higher than Indian IT firms’ price-earnings ratios. If TCS can credibly present itself as both a technology and infrastructure play, it could attract a new class of investors seeking exposure to digital infrastructure. Still, this is not a business for those seeking quick wins. Like we mentioned earlier, data centres are a low margin play. Yet for TCS, this may be less about margins than momentum. The IT industry is at an inflection point: AI threatens to commoditize traditional outsourcing even as clients demand end-to-end digital transformation. Owning infrastructure offers TCS a new strategic lever, a way to control the stack from physical data to cognitive intelligence. “TCS’ moat won’t be real estate—it will be orchestration," said Fersht. “By owning the infrastructure, it can combine data engineering and AI services under one roof." Krithivasan’s wager, then, is not for immediate approval but for long-term relevance. As India’s data centre capacity surges and its AI ambitions swell, the company is positioning itself at the intersection of both trends. If it captures even a modest slice of the coming capacity boom, TCS could evolve from an outsourcing icon into a domestic infrastructure powerhouse. For the Tata Group, too, this is a return to form. From steel and power to software and satellites, its empire has always thrived on long horizons. The data centre bet is merely the digital reincarnation of that legacy. For Krithivasan, the challenge is deeply personal. He took charge in a moment of flux—after a surprise leadership exit, in a slowing industry, with AI rewriting the rules of competition. Now he must steer a company known for intangible efficiency into a world of tangible assets and operational grit. If he succeeds, TCS will not just sell cloud services—it will own a piece of the cloud itself. Key Takeaways TCS will spend $6.5 billion over six years to develop 1GW of data centre capacity. This planned capacity alone is enough to match India’s entire current data centre base. The investment is driven by the explosion of demand for high-speed computing infrastructure due to AI, and India’s data-localization rules that require data to be stored within her borders. The move is enabled by the Tata conglomerate's breadth—TCS plans to leverage sister companies like Tata Power and Tata Communications for power supply and connectivity. This marks a fundamental reversal for TCS; it is shifting from being an asset-light exporter of intangible code and services to becoming a capital-intensive physical infrastructure player. But, data centres are a low-margin, capex-intensive business with slow returns. This risks diluting TCS’ margins, forcing investors accustomed to high dividend payouts to recalibrate expectations.

The global hyperscalers, meanwhile, have been expanding capacity across India as part of their global grids. The Tatas, cautious and conservative, stayed on the sidelines. Part of that hesitation stemmed from perception. Data centres were once viewed less as cutting-edge technology and more as glorified real-estate plays—capital-heavy, regulatory-ridden, and operationally messy. They required land, reliable electricity, and long-term financing, all of which had tripped up the Tata Group before. For a company built on intellectual capital, the business felt foreign. What has changed is the scale of the opportunity. India today accounts for roughly 20% of global data generation but only about 3% of storage capacity. Its total installed capacity—around one GW—is precisely what TCS aims to build by 2030. Analysts at Cushman & Wakefield estimate that India’s data centre capacity will triple to 1,825 megawatt (MW) by 2027, driven by new data-localization rules and the country’s voracious digital appetite. States are competing fiercely for investment. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Telangana are offering everything from electricity-duty waivers to land subsidies of up to 50%. Mumbai, with undersea cable landings and strong power grids, remains the favoured hub, but smaller cities are emerging as contenders. For TCS, whose domestic revenue still accounts for less than 10% of its total ($30.18 billion) but grew 62% last year—largely due to a ₹1.5-billion BSNL contract—the timing aligns with a broader strategic shift toward India-focused business. As global clients hesitate, India’s digital infrastructure push offers both stability and scale. The orchestraMeanwhile, the data centre gamble will not only test TCS’s financial muscle but execution capability as well. Building and operating data centres demands coordination across engineering, real estate, power management, and cybersecurity—far removed from writing code. Yet, this is where the Tata Group’s breadth could become a decisive advantage. TCS can draw on group companies such as Tata Power, Tata Communications, Nelco, and Tata Electronics for power supply, network connectivity, satellite links, and chip technology. That’s a web of synergies that rivals like Infosys or Wipro simply cannot replicate. “TCS has a unique opportunity to serve the broader Tata Group across businesses in telecom, networks, energy and cooling solutions," said Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, partner at Catalincs, a consulting firm. “It can cross leverage these capabilities across the conglomerate structure, something that other large IT companies don’t have." TCS can draw on group companies such as Tata Power, Tata Communications, Nelco, and Tata Electronics for power supply, network connectivity, satellite links, and chip technology. That’s a web of synergies. Still, competition will be fierce. To find its niche, TCS must differentiate not by sheer size but by integration—offering clients a seamless bridge between the data centre and the AI workloads that run on it. “TCS is not trying to compete with AWS or Azure on a raw scale," said Phil Fersht, chief executive of HFS Research, a consulting firm. “It’s trying to own the intersection of infrastructure and services—both the data centre and the AI models that sit on top. That’s where the value will lie." Such integration could also help TCS reposition itself in the eyes of investors. Global data centre operators like Equinix and Digital Realty command enterprise-value multiples of 20 to 22 times Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), higher than Indian IT firms’ price-earnings ratios. If TCS can credibly present itself as both a technology and infrastructure play, it could attract a new class of investors seeking exposure to digital infrastructure. Still, this is not a business for those seeking quick wins. Like we mentioned earlier, data centres are a low margin play. Yet for TCS, this may be less about margins than momentum. The IT industry is at an inflection point: AI threatens to commoditize traditional outsourcing even as clients demand end-to-end digital transformation. Owning infrastructure offers TCS a new strategic lever, a way to control the stack from physical data to cognitive intelligence. “TCS’ moat won’t be real estate—it will be orchestration," said Fersht. “By owning the infrastructure, it can combine data engineering and AI services under one roof." Krithivasan’s wager, then, is not for immediate approval but for long-term relevance. As India’s data centre capacity surges and its AI ambitions swell, the company is positioning itself at the intersection of both trends. If it captures even a modest slice of the coming capacity boom, TCS could evolve from an outsourcing icon into a domestic infrastructure powerhouse. For the Tata Group, too, this is a return to form. From steel and power to software and satellites, its empire has always thrived on long horizons. The data centre bet is merely the digital reincarnation of that legacy. For Krithivasan, the challenge is deeply personal. He took charge in a moment of flux—after a surprise leadership exit, in a slowing industry, with AI rewriting the rules of competition. Now he must steer a company known for intangible efficiency into a world of tangible assets and operational grit. If he succeeds, TCS will not just sell cloud services—it will own a piece of the cloud itself. Key Takeaways TCS will spend $6.5 billion over six years to develop 1GW of data centre capacity. This planned capacity alone is enough to match India’s entire current data centre base. The investment is driven by the explosion of demand for high-speed computing infrastructure due to AI, and India’s data-localization rules that require data to be stored within her borders. The move is enabled by the Tata conglomerate's breadth—TCS plans to leverage sister companies like Tata Power and Tata Communications for power supply and connectivity. This marks a fundamental reversal for TCS; it is shifting from being an asset-light exporter of intangible code and services to becoming a capital-intensive physical infrastructure player. But, data centres are a low-margin, capex-intensive business with slow returns. This risks diluting TCS’ margins, forcing investors accustomed to high dividend payouts to recalibrate expectations. The patience required may be considerable. Unlike software projects, data centres are capital-intensive, slow to scale and operationally demanding. TCS’s decision to build rather than rent puts it in competition with hyperscalers and domestic real-estate developers alike. The company is entering a field already crowded with global giants—Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon—as well as Indian powerhouses such as Reliance, AdaniConnex and Yotta. The irony is that, given its scale and client relationships, TCS should have been a natural candidate to own data centres years ago. Instead, it spent two decades returning wealth to shareholders— ₹3.66 trillion through dividends and buybacks since its listing. That generosity may now come at a cost. With the new investment cycle, margins could tighten, and dividend payouts to parent Tata Sons may moderate. Last year, TCS contributed 83% of Tata Sons’ income. Data centres can be bracketed into four types. First, there are the enterprise data centres, which are facilities owned and run by companies and houses their computing networks. A second category is hyperscale data centres, also known as Cloud data centres. Amazon and Microsoft own and manage these facilities. Edge data centres are the third category. Here, smaller facilities are set up closer to an organization, thereby improving speed, and are essential for real-time data processing tasks. Finally, there are the colocation data centres, a space TCS is venturing into. In this category, the data centre owner sets up the physical infrastructure, manages the facility, oversees the building, power, and cooling for the servers. The customer supplies and manages their equipment. McKinsey, a consulting firm, states that colocation data centres operate at lower profitability than cloud data centres. This is because the hyperscalers, who are the primary customers of colocation data centres, can negotiate better prices since they also set up and have their own facilities. The operating margins of Equinix and Sify, who run colocation data centres, are in the range of 22% and 19%, respectively. In comparison, the operating margins enjoyed by AWS and Azure are significantly higher, at 35-37%. Executives say TCS’s balance sheet can absorb the shock. The company generated ₹46,449 crore in free cash flow last year, more than enough to underwrite the initial phases. Yet investors accustomed to industry-leading operating margins (TCS ended with 24.3% in operating margin last year) may need to reset expectations. The stock’s 3.5% dip in three days following the announcement suggests the market is already doing so. “TCS management stated that each 150-megawatt build-out phase of the data centre will require $1 billion capex, for a $6.5 billion total investment. We think this direction could offer new potential revenue streams though could negatively impact margins," Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 9 October. Returns are slow, and could take a decade. In addition, technology cycles move faster than depreciation schedules. “This is an asset-intensive industry where labour-arbitrage advantages don’t translate," said Peter Bendor-Samuel of Everest Group, a research firm. “Investors used to high-margin, low-capex returns will need to recalibrate." Analysts at JM Financial estimated revenue from 1MW of operational data centres in the first year to be about ₹22 crore. TCS’s target of having a 150 MW data centre operational by April 2027 implies an incremental business of ₹3,300 crore. A successful operational capacity of 1 GW in six years would translate to about ₹22,000 crore, similar to its India revenue of ₹21,958 crore last year.

For years, Indian conglomerates like Reliance and Adani have been laying the groundwork for data centre dominance, tying these projects to their energy and telecom networks.

OpenAI has partnered with Broadcom to produce its first in-house artificial intelligence processors, the latest chip tie-up for the ChatGPT maker as it races to secure the computing power needed to meet surging demand for its services. Shares of Broadcom rose more than 10%. The companies said on Monday that OpenAI would design the chips, which Broadcom will develop and deploy starting in the second half of 2026. They will roll out 10 gigawatts worth of custom chips, whose power consumption is roughly equivalent to the needs of more than 8 million U.S. households or five times the electricity produced by the Hoover Dam. Most analysts do not expect the deal, the latest effort by a tech company to develop custom AI chips, to challenge Nvidia’s grip on the AI accelerator market, given the significant challenge of designing, scaling and manufacturing in-house chips from the ground up. The OpenAI-Broadcom deal is the latest in a string of massive chip investments that have highlighted the technology industry’s surging appetite for computing power as it races to build the most sophisticated AI systems. OpenAI last week unveiled a 6-gigawatt AI chip supply deal with AMD that includes an option to buy a stake in the chipmaker, days after disclosing that Nvidia plans to invest up to $100 billion in the startup and provide it with data-center systems with at least 10 gigawatts of capacity. “Partnering with Broadcom is a critical step in building the infrastructure needed to unlock AI’s potential,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. Financial details of the agreement were not disclosed and it was not immediately clear how OpenAI would fund the deal. A one-gigawatt data center can cost between $50 billion and $60 billion, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in August, adding that Nvidia products, powering the data center, can represent more than half of those costs. The 2026 timeline set out by OpenAI for the build-out is aggressive, but the startup is also best positioned to raise the funds required for the project, given the heights of investor confidence, said Gadjo Sevilla, an analyst at eMarketer. “Financing such a large chip deal will likely require a combination of funding rounds, pre-orders, strategic investments, and support from Microsoft, as well as leveraging future revenue streams and potential credit facilities.” The tie-up with Broadcom, first reported by Reuters last year, places OpenAI among cloud-computing giants such as Alphabet-owned Google and Amazon.com that are developing custom chips to meet surging AI demand and reduce dependence on costly, supply-constrained Nvidia processors. However, similar efforts by Microsoft and Meta have failed to match the performance of Nvidia chips, according to media reports. Still, the rise in demand for custom chips has turned Broadcom into one of the biggest winners of the generative AI boom, with its stock price rising nearly six-fold since the end of 2022. Broadcom unveiled a $10 billion custom AI chip order in September from an unnamed new customer, which some analysts speculated was OpenAI. However, a company executive on Monday alluded that OpenAI was not that unnamed client. Broadcom and OpenAI said on Monday that the deployment of the new custom chips would be completed by the end of 2029, building on their existing co-development and supply agreements. The new systems will be scaled entirely using Broadcom’s Ethernet and other networking gear, challenging Nvidia’s InfiniBand networking solution. Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) announced its first list of 14 candidates for the Bihar assembly polls, with its state unit chief Raju Tiwary and leader Hulas Pandey among the nominees. As per the seat-sharing arrangement, LJP (RV) will contest 29 seats, while BJP and JD(U) will contest 101 seats each. The remaining 15 candidates will be announced soon.

Title: Carbon credits are failing to help with climate change — here’s why

Achieving the global temperature targets set in the Paris climate agreement requires deep, rapid cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions, and therefore the swift phase-out of fossil fuels. Many factors stand in the way. One of the most pernicious is carbon offsets. Offsets are tradable credits from projects that claim to reduce emissions, either by avoiding them or by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Businesses and countries trade these credits — each representing the equivalent of one tonne of CO2 — to ‘neutralize’ their own emissions. Net zero needs AI — five actions to realize its promise Net zero needs AI — five actions to realize its promise Although conceptually appealing, this reliance on offsets has fatal flaws. In practice, it’s difficult to ensure that they represent real emissions reductions rather than ‘hot air’, with the claimed climate benefits existing only on paper. Equally challenging is ensuring that emission reductions are ‘additional’, meaning that they would not have occurred without the incentive provided by the sale of carbon credits. For projects credited for sequestering carbon, it is also crucial to ensure that the CO2 is locked away permanently and not released back into the atmosphere later. Most carbon-offset schemes fall foul of one or more of these requirements. Thus, offsets undermine decarbonization by enabling companies and countries to claim that emissions have been reduced when they have not. This results in more emissions, delays the phase-out of fossil fuels and diverts scarce resources to false solutions. Yet, climate-policy processes continue to rely on them. The operationalization of Article 6 of the Paris agreement and full implementation of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, both achieved in 2024, are set to turbocharge demand for carbon credits. In parallel, voluntary carbon markets are promising to raise standards as a way of further legitimizing and scaling up offsets. Of greatest concern is the expanding role of offsets in domestic carbon-pricing schemes, such as emissions trading and carbon taxes. Although the European Union’s Emissions Trading System phased out offsets in 2020, they still feature in most major carbon-pricing schemes outside Europe, including in China, Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore, California, Canada and Australia. They are even permitted as a substitute for paying carbon taxes in countries such as South Africa, Mexico, Chile and Colombia. Such practices threaten to undermine global decarbonization efforts. Low-quality offsets artificially depress carbon prices, which dilutes the incentive for industries to cut their emissions and weakens the effectiveness of carbon-pricing schemes. Here, we outline the problems and call on decision makers to exclude offsets from carbon-pricing schemes. Carbon offsetting sounds simple on paper. In practice, it is anything but. It is extremely difficult to evaluate the emission reductions achieved by offset projects because calculations require comparing outcomes with ‘business-as-usual’ projections. For example, calculating the climate benefits from a project that avoids deforestation involves comparing a forest’s actual carbon stock to that in a counterfactual scenario in which the project did not happen. The hypothetical nature of such calculations invites manipulation and can tempt project developers to overestimate business-as-usual emissions to generate more credits. Heatwaves linked to carbon emissions from specific companies Heatwaves linked to carbon emissions from specific companies Fundamental imbalances in the information used in offset schemes leave them vulnerable to these outcomes. In most cases, only project leaders and developers know whether their projects are dependent on credit revenues and are therefore truly additional. This makes it difficult for administrators to screen out shoddy projects. Even where projects are additional, errors can arise from inaccurate measurement of emissions and carbon stocks. These risks are most acute when the sources and sinks are variable. For example, stocks of soil organic carbon vary naturally across landscapes and through time. This is a product of diversity in soil characteristics, topography and vegetation cover, as well as in seasonal, annual and decadal changes in temperatures and rainfall. The variability makes it difficult to accurately measure changes in the carbon stock and ensure that the credited carbon storage is fully attributable to the project1. It is also difficult to ensure that credited carbon removals remain sequestered. Many carbon sinks are susceptible to natural disturbances, such as droughts and wildfires, which can release carbon stored in trees and soils. Carbon stocks can also be lost through the clearing of vegetation and other changes in land-management practices. Despite these risks, most offset schemes mandate that credited sinks be maintained for only 40 years or even less. Given that CO2 emissions require thousands of years to be reabsorbed by Earth’s climate system2, credited removals need to lock away carbon for a similar period to genuinely neutralize the warming caused by the emissions that are claimed to be offset. In most markets, the risks associated with the supply of low-quality goods and services can be alleviated if consumers are able to judge quality and seek redress when standards are not met. With offsets, however, the complexity and a lack of transparency make it close to impossible for buyers to make informed decisions about the quality of most credits. Moreover, many buyers are not incentivized to care. Typically, their priority is to procure credits at the lowest possible cost, a fact evidenced by a 2024 study revealing that the largest corporate buyers consistently choose low-priced credits over higher-quality alternatives3. Why the green-technology race might not save the planet Why the green-technology race might not save the planet For these reasons, the integrity of offset schemes hinges on the skills and efforts of administrators, but they are often incentivized to prioritize supply over integrity. In voluntary offset markets, registries rely on project registrations and credit issuances for revenue, while competing with one another for market share. Tightening integrity standards can therefore reduce revenue and put this business model at risk. Government-regulated offset programmes linked to carbon-pricing schemes show a similar dynamic. The main reason that pricing schemes allow the use of offsets is to lower compliance costs for polluters, thereby reducing resistance to climate policies4. Yet the focus on cost reduction places pressure on regulators to ensure a plentiful supply of low-cost credits, frequently at the expense of environmental integrity. These interlinked issues make integrity failings inevitable. The science reflects this, with studies repeatedly showing that few of the major offset types in use today deliver real, additional or permanent abatement. A 2024 meta-analysis examining some 2,300 offset projects — amounting to around one-fifth of all issued credits — found that less than 16% achieved the emissions reductions claimed by developers5. In-depth evaluations of avoided deforestation6, renewable energy7 and clean cooking-stove projects8 have also exposed persistent problems with additionality, inaccurate measurement and impermanence. Recognizing these flaws, some stakeholders advocate a shift from projects that avoid emissions to those that remove carbon from the atmosphere. However, carbon-removal projects tend to have similar integrity problems. Engineering-based techniques are scarce, and so most removal projects currently involve less durable nature-based approaches, such as tree planting, improved soil management and production of biochar (plant-derived charcoal). And just as with emissions-avoidance projects, studies reveal persistent integrity failings, particularly regarding the crediting of non-existent and non-additional removals9,10. Bad offsets cheat the climate by failing to deliver their promised emission reductions. And they do further damage by distorting carbon-pricing schemes. Six roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them Six roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them In a well-functioning emissions trading scheme, the carbon price will reflect the marginal cost of reducing emissions, whether at a polluting facility or through an offset project. When offsets lack integrity, credit prices reflect the cost of supplying pretend, rather than real, emission reductions, which artificially lowers the carbon price. The same is true for carbon taxes: low-integrity credits reduce the carbon price faced by polluters by allowing them to surrender cheap credits in place of paying the tax. or

UPDATED 19:15 EDT / OCTOBER 13 2025 by Maria Deutscher JPMorgan Chase & Co. today announced plans to invest up to $10 billion in technology and infrastructure companies. The news sent several quantum computer makers’ shares soaring more than 20%. JPMorgan will invest mainly in U.S. companies with the goal of supporting their engineering and manufacturing operations. The bank will make the investments as part of a new program, the Security and Resiliency Initiative, through which it plans to support “industries critical to national economic security and resiliency.” In addition to investing its own capital, the bank will provide participating companies with $1.5 trillion worth of financing over 10 years, 50% more than what it had planned to offer before. The Security and Resiliency Initiative will focus on 27 different areas that the bank has organized into four categories. The first category, which JPMorgan calls frontier and strategic technologies, includes five technology verticals including quantum computing. Shares of quantum computer developers D-Wave Quantum Inc. and IonQ Inc. rose more than 20% on the news, while Quantum Computing Inc. closed 12% higher. It’s possible JPMorgan’s interest in the quantum technology market isn’t limited solely to computers. The bank listed sensor hardware as a focus of its new investment initiative. Many of the most advanced sensors in development today use quantum mechanical phenomena, such as the behavior of low-temperature atoms, to detect environmental changes. IonQ, one of the quantum computer makers that logged stock price gains today, entered the quantum sensor market earlier this year. Alongside its frontier and strategic technologies category, JPMorgan plans to invest in three other areas. They include supply chain and advanced manufacturing, defense and aerospace and energy independence and resilience. Those categories also include technology-related subfields. JPMorgan’s supply chain and advanced manufacturing investment plan, for example, will partly focus on companies developing autonomous mobile robots. The bank will also seek to back chipmaking equipment providers. In the energy sector, battery storage is among the technologies that JPMorgan lists as a priority. The Wall Street heavyweight will hire bankers, investment professionals and other experts to support its new financing initiative. It will also appoint an external advisory council to help guide the program. “Our security is predicated on the strength and resiliency of America’s economy,” said JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon. “America needs more speed and investment.” Another major financial institution, The Goldman Sachs Group Inc., is also sharpening its focus on the tech sector. The investment bank today announced plans to acquire San Francisco-based venture capital firm Industry Ventures for $665 million in cash and equity. Goldman Sachs will pay an additional $300 million through 2030 if certain performance goals are met. Industry Ventures has 45 staffers who manage $7 billion worth of assets. The firm has backed Meta Platforms Inc., Uber Technologies Inc. and other major consumer tech firms over the past 25 years. Its portfolio also includes enterprise software companies such as Datadog Inc., a publicly traded observability provider.

Title: Is the AI Conveyor Belt of Capital About to Stop?

reading time 8 minutes The American economy is little more than a big bet on AI. Morgan Stanley investor Ruchir Sharma recently noted that money poured into AI investments now accounts for about 40% of the United Statesâ GDP growth in 2025, and AI companies are responsible for 80% of growth in American stocks. So how bad is it that the most recent major deal among AI giants, agreements that have driven up stock prices dramatically, look like a snake eating its own tail? In recent months, Nvidia announced that it would invest $100 billion into OpenAI, OpenAI announced that it would pay $300 billion to Oracle for computing power, and Oracle announced it would buy $40 billion worth of chips from Nvidia. It doesnât take a flow chart to get the feeling that these firms are just moving money around between each other. But surely thatâs not happeningâ¦right? Itâs a little harder to get assurances of that than you might think.Â Many of these agreements are, on their face, mutually beneficial. If everything is on the level, while these deals might be circular, they should be moving everything forward. Rishi Jaluria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, told Gizmodo that deals like these could result in a âless capacity-constrained world,â which would allow for faster development of models that could produce higher returns on investment. âThe better models we have, the more we can realize a lot of these AI use cases that are on hold just because the technology isnât powerful enough yet to handle it,â he said. âIf that happens, and that can generate real [return on investment] for customers â¦ that results in real cost savings, potentially new revenue generation opportunities, and that creates net benefits from a GDP perspective.â So as long as we keep having AI breakthroughs and these companies figure out how to monetize their products, everything should be fine. On the off chance that doesnât happen, though?Â âIf that doesn’t happen, if there is no real enterprise AI adoption, then it’s all round-tripping,â Jaluria said. Round-tripping, generally speaking, refers to the unethical and typically illegal practice of making trades or transactions to artificially prop up a particular asset or company, making it look like itâs more valuable and in demand than it actually is. In this case, it would be tech companies that are trying to make it appear like they are more valuable than they actually are by announcing big deals with each other that move the stock price.Â So what might suggest whether this money is actually accomplishing anything other than serving as hot air in a rapidly inflating bubble? Jaluria said heâs watching for faster developments of models, advancements in performance, and overall AI adoption. âIf this leads to a step function change in the way enterprise is adopting and utilizing AI, that creates a benefit,â he said. Whether that is happening currently or not is kind of in the eye of the beholder. OpenAI has certainly shown advancements in its technology. The release of its Sora 2 video generation model has unleashed a fresh hell upon the world, used to generate significant amounts of copyright violations and misinformation. But the latest version of the companyâs flagship model, GPT-5, underwhelmed and failed to live up to expectations when it was released in August.Â Adoption rates of the technology are also a bit of a Rorschach test. The company boasts that 10% of the world is using ChatGPT, and nearly 80% of the business world says that itâs looking into how to utilize the technology. But the early adopters arenât finding much utility. According to a survey from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 95% of companies that have tried to integrate generative AI tools into their operations have produced zero return on investment. Where these investments are generating a return is in the stock market. Which, frankly, does not quell concerns about these firms simply boosting one anotherâs bottom line. Take Oracle, for example. Last month, the cloud provider had aÂ rough quarter by all traditional indicators. It missed on both its revenue and earnings projections, and its net income was flat year-over-year. And yet, the stock price soared. The reason: the company’s plump list of remaining performance obligationsâfinancial agreements that will provide revenue that have not yet been fulfilled. There, the company showed a massive amount of growth, a 359% increase from the year prior, with a projected $455 billion coming in.Â That money is not real yet. Nor is the growth the company has promised, claiming that its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure revenue would grow from under $20 billion to nearly $150 billion before the start of the 2030s. But all of it was sufficient for investors to drive up Oracle’s share price enough to slingshot CEO Larry Ellison into the top spot on the world’s richest person list, briefly leapfrogging Elon Musk.Â Most of this promised revenue will come from OpenAI, which made a commitment to purchase $300 billion worth of computing power from the company over five years. The clock on that contract doesn’t start until 2027, but assuming it actually happens, it would be one of the largest cloud computing deals in history. It’s also one of the most unlikely, just based on where the companies involved currently stand. In order to provide the compute that it has promised to OpenAI, Oracle will reportedly need to generate 4.5 gigawatts of power capacity, more than two Hoover Dams’ worth of power. On the other side of the deal, OpenAI will have to pay about $60 billion per year to fit the bill for the agreement. It currently generates about $10 billion in revenue, which, statistically speaking, is less than $60 billion. You can see a similar circular shape to OpenAIâs recent deal with Nvidia rival AMD, too. The exact details of the agreement werenât reported, but chipmaker AMD expects to generate tens of billions of dollars over the next half-decade as it sells its AI chips to OpenAI. As part of the agreement, OpenAI gets a swath of shares in AMD, with options to buy up to 10% of the company. Lucky for OpenAI, thereâs really no better time to get your hands on some AMD shares than right before it announces a big AI-related deal. The companyâs stock price surged by about 35% following the announcement.Â With those two most recent deals on the books, OpenAI has agreed to more than $1 trillion worth of computing deals so far this year. Thatâs a lot for any company to spend, but itâs especially a lot for a still-private company that reports just $10 billion in projected revenue through 2025. Even by its most recent funding rounds, the company as a whole is currently valued at about $500 billion. Most of those deals have contingencies attached. For instance, Nvidiaâs investment in OpenAI isnât actually $100 billion, but an initial $10 billion for one gigawatt of data center capacity with the potential for $100 billion if 10 gigawatts are ultimately achieved. But the stock prices and valuations certainly seem to treat these deals as if they are set in stone. And OpenAI seems to be operating that way, too. The company claims that itâll more than 10x its revenue in the next few years, and projects itâll hit $129 billion annually by 2029. That type of potentially inflated revenue figure is the kind of thing that makes some people think of the Dot Com bubble of the early 2000s, where we saw companies like Commerce One receive a $21 billion valuation despite barely having any revenue. But Peter Atwater, Adjunct Professor of Economics at William and Mary and President of consulting firm Financial Insyghts, sees a different reflection in the AI bubble: the housing market collapse.Â âWhat we saw at the top of the mortgage market was all of these conveyor belts of capital, money flowing from one party to another party to another party. And what you started to see was that there were multiple points of relationship so that any participant in the system was then dependent on every other conveyor belt in the system working simultaneously to keep the system going,â he told Gizmodo. âIn many ways, we’re seeing the same developing web of capital flows across the AI space.â This creates some obvious problems. The circular deals that, in theory, are wheels moving the whole thing forward all have to keep turning. If any of them stop, the whole thing stops, because they are all so interconnected that no failure is truly isolated.Â Atwater said that the types of major, metric-contingent deals that have been dominating headlines in the AI space arenât all that different from some of what was happening in the mortgage industry back in 2007, where some of the financial commitments required mortgages to meet certain conditions. âIn the frenzy of a bubble, everyone overcommits. The purpose of overcommitting is to stake a claim in what you believe will be an intensely scarce commodity in the future. So you have buyers overcommit and you have sellers agreeing to overprovide as a result,â he explained. âWhat we find over and over is that commitments are among the first obligations to be cut off once conditions change, once confidence begins to fall.â Right now, thereâs a stomach for those commitments. That isnât guaranteed to be there in the future if all of these promised returns on investment donât materialize. Atwater said that the market requires credit markets being willing to continue to extend massive sums of money to cover the agreements made, equity markets that value these transactions at âan extraordinary multiple,â and suppliers capable of delivering the promised products. Thereâs no guarantee that all of those factors will hold.Â The math is already pretty tricky. As tech commentator Ed Zitron has pointed out, major firms like Microsoft, Meta, Tesla, Amazon, and Google have invested about $560 billion in AI infrastructure over the last two years. Theyâve brought in a combined $35 billion in AI-related revenue. OpenAIâs commitments are even bigger, with returns that are arguably even smaller.Â The companyâs development and expansion of its services will rely in no small part on massive data center projects, which will require the same amount of energy to operate as New York City and San Diego combinedâenergy that currently isnât even available. And, once again, there is no guarantee that the end product, once all of that energy is spent and data centers are built, will actually generate revenue. âUltimately, if you do not have a consumer for the product, there will be no AI space because these companies can’t continue to do this for nothing. Listening to a lot of the calls in the last couple of weeks, there’s a clear open question as to how these companies are going to make money at this,â Atwater said. For the moment, everyone is seeing green, and hope springs eternal. As long as that is the case, no one will ask where the revenue is coming from. âRight now, the AI sector is operating in a forever mindset. They are acting as if they have a very long period of time under which they can figure this out and make money,â Atwater said. âAs long as confidence is high, this entire ecosystem can offer fantasy. When confidence falls, they’re going to be expected to deliver real-term performance in a very short time frame.â Unfortunately, should that happen, it wonât just be these companies that bear the brunt of the failure. âYou have to look at this as a larger ecosystem. To talk about AI today, it means we have to talk about the credit market, we have to talk about the credit market. Wall Street and AI are a single beast,â Atwater said, warning that a very small number of firms currently have a major grasp on the whole of the American economy.Â Lots of investors are piling into the AI space, fearful of missing out on a market that seems like it can only go up. But few of them are looking at why those valuations and stock prices keep climbing, showing little curiosity as to what might happen if all of this money is just getting shifted around, artificially inflating the actual value of the companies they are betting on.Â ââWhy?â,â Atwater said, “is the last question asked in a bull market.” Explore more on these topics Share this story Subscribe and interact with our community, get up to date with our customised Newsletters and much more.

Title: The A.I. Boom and the Spectre of 1929

As stocks plummeted on the morning of October 24th, 1929, a large crowd gathered on Wall Street outside of the New York Stock Exchange. Pat Bologna, a local shoeshiner whose life savings were invested in the market, dodged into a packed brokerage nearby. “Everybody is shouting,” he later recalled. “They’re all trying to reach the glass booth where the clerks are. Everybody wants to sell out. The boy at the quotation board is running scared. He can’t keep up with the speed of the way stocks are dropping. The board’s painted green. The guy who runs it is Irish. He’s standing at the back of the booth, on the telephone. I can’t hear what he’s saying. But a guy near me shouts, ‘the sonofabitch has sold me out!’ ” The stock-market crash of 1929 occupies a dark but indelible place in the national imagination, and for good reason. In the age of online trading and algorithmic traders, the next stock crash, whenever it comes, will be a largely digital phenomenon. But its consequences will certainly play out in the analog world: wealth destruction, human anguish, fallout in the rest of the economy. On Wall Street, as the speculative A.I. boom continues to grow, even some financial titans are acknowledging that it might not end well. “There will be a check at some point, there will be a drawdown,” David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, said at a recent conference. Last week, Jamie Dimon, the head of JPMorgan Chase, told the BBC that he was “far more worried” than others about the possibility of a big fall in the market. A few days later, when Donald Trump threatened to impose new tariffs on China, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dived nine hundred points, only to rebound on Monday after Trump softened his rhetoric. Perhaps the most alarming feature of the 1929 crash was that it wasn’t a one-off. After peaking in September, 1929, the Dow Jones Industrial Average entered a downward trend that lasted nearly three years; by July of 1932, it had sunk by about ninety per cent. The crash’s giddy prequel, dramatic unfolding, and shattering aftermath—the Great Depression—has long provided compelling material for writers. In 1931, Frederick Lewis Allen, of Harper’s Magazine, described in his book “Only Yesterday” the speculative frenzy that preceded the crash: “Stories of fortunes made overnight were on everybody’s lips. . . . Wives were asking their husbands why they were so slow, why they weren’t getting in on all this, only to hear that their husbands had bought a hundred shares of American Linseed that very morning.” Almost a quarter century later, John Kenneth Galbraith brought an economist’s eye and a dry wit to the subject with “The Great Crash 1929.” The book detailed how, in the summer of that year, when stock prices were already sky-high, the Goldman Sachs Trading Corporation, in partnership with the utility baron Harrison Williams, launched two huge investment trusts, the Shenandoah Corporation and the Blue Ridge Corporation, which employed leverage—that is, borrowed money—and a pyramid structure to magnify investors’ gains (or, as it turned out, their losses). “If there must be madness something may be said for having it on a heroic scale,” Galbraith wrote. In 1979, the fiftieth anniversary of the crash, the co-authors Gordon Thomas and Max Morgan-Witts published “The Day the Bubble Burst,” which included the anecdote about the shoeshiner. Now, four years before the hundredth anniversary, comes “1929,” a new book by Andrew Ross Sorkin, a financial columnist for the Times and a co-anchor on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” As in Sorkin’s previous book, “Too Big to Fail,” a best-selling account of the financial crisis of 2008, he focusses mainly on the financiers and policymakers at the center of the crisis, drawing on private letters, transcripts, oral histories, architectural plans, memoirs, newspaper accounts, corporate filings, and prior histories. His narrative extends from February of 1929 to well beyond the crash, to the failed efforts of Herbert Hoover to revive a stricken economy; the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt; the U.S. Senate’s famous Pecora Commission, which exposed a great deal of Wall Street self-dealing; and the passage of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, which curbed some of the Street’s excesses by separating commercial banking (making loans and taking deposits) from investment banking (selling and dealing in securities). Other reforms introduced under Roosevelt included the founding of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which had a mandate to protect investors and maintain fair and orderly markets, and the federal insurance of bank deposits, which ended a calamitous wave of bank runs. In historical terms, the 1929 crash and the election of F.D.R. marked the dividing line between the untrammelled financial capitalism that had emerged during the Gilded Age in the late nineteenth century, and the managed capitalism of the mid-twentieth century. For several decades, this system delivered strong economic growth and a more equal income distribution, until inflation upended it and ushered in the neoliberal era of financial deregulation. (In 1999, Bill Clinton signed into law the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which repealed key parts of Glass-Steagall.) During the nineteen-twenties, Sorkin writes, “Wall Street became like a giant balloon floating above the common people, its self-mythologizing leaders enjoying the comforts of what felt like a privileged realm.” His leading characters include Charles Mitchell, the chairman of National City Bank, a predecessor of Citibank, who, in March of 1929, resisted efforts by the Federal Reserve to restrict bank lending to speculators in the market; Thomas Lamont, a senior partner at J. P. Morgan & Co., who, during the panic selling on October 24th, organized a futile effort to stabilize the market; and Jesse Livermore, a storied speculator who made and lost several fortunes before eventually shooting himself in the cloakroom of the Sherry-Netherland hotel. There are cameos by everyone from Al Smith and William Randolph Hearst to Winston Churchill and Groucho Marx, both of whom speculated heavily in the market and paid the price. No two speculative booms are exactly alike, of course, but they share some common elements. Typically, there is great excitement among investors about new technology—in today’s case, A.I.—and its potential to boost profits for companies positioned to take advantage of it. In the twenties, commercial radio was a novel and revolutionary medium: tens of millions of Americans tuned in. Sorkin points out that, between 1921 and 1928, stock in Radio Corporation of America, the Nvidia of its day, went from $1 ½ to $85 ½. Another hallmark of a stock bubble is that, at some point, its participants largely give up on conventional valuation measures and buy in simply because prices are rising and everybody else is doing it: FOMO rules the day. By some metrics, valuations were even higher during the late-nineteen-nineties internet stock bubble than they were in the late twenties. And according to the latest report from the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee, which was released last week, valuations in the U.S. market are, by one measure, “comparable to the peak of the dot-com bubble.” That’s true according to the cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio, which tracks stock prices relative to corporate earnings averaged over the previous ten years. If, instead of looking back, you focus on predictions of future earnings, valuations are less stretched: the Bank of England report noted that they remain “below the levels reached during the dot-com bubble.” But that’s just another way of saying that investors are betting on earnings growing rapidly in the coming years. And this is a moment when many companies have so far seen precious little return for their A.I. investments. To be sure, not everyone agrees that stock prices have departed from reality. In a note to clients last week, analysts at Goldman Sachs said the market’s rise, which is heavily concentrated in Big Tech stocks, “has, so far, been driven by fundamental growth rather than irrational speculation.” Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia, whose chips power A.I. systems at companies such as OpenAI, Google, and Meta, said that he believed the world was at “the beginning of a new industrial revolution.” However, even the authors of the Goldman report acknowledged that there are elements of the current situation “that rhyme with previous bubbles,” including the big gains in stock prices and the emergence of questionable financing schemes. Last month, Nvidia announced it would invest up to one hundred billion dollars over the next decade in OpenAI, the parent company of ChatGPT, which is already a big purchaser of Nvidia’s chips and will likely need more to power its expansion. Nvidia has said OpenAI isn’t obligated to spend the money it invests on Nvidia chips, but the deal, and others like it, have sparked comparisons to the dot-com bubble, when some big tech companies engaged in so-called “circular” transactions that ultimately didn’t work out. Another recurring feature of the biggest asset booms is outright chicanery, such as fraudulent accounting, the marketing of worthless securities, and plain old stealing. Galbraith referred to this phenomenon as “the bezzle.” In hard times, he noted, creditors are tight-fisted and audits are scrupulous: as a result, “commercial morality is enormously improved.” In boom times, creditors are more trusting, lending standards get debased, and borrowed money is plentiful. But there “are always many people who need more,” Galbraith explained, and “the bezzle increases rapidly,” as it did in the late twenties. “Just as the boom accelerated the rate of growth,” he went on, “so the crash enormously advanced the rate of discovery.” Sorkin traces the fates of Albert Wiggin and Richard Whitney, who, at the time of the crash were, respectively, the C.E.O. of Chase National Bank and the vice-president of the New York Stock Exchange. Both men were involved in the failed effort, orchestrated by Lamont, to stabilize the market. In 1932, Wiggin went on to become a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. But, during the Pecora investigation, which began that same year, it emerged that, beginning in September of 1929, Wiggin had secretly shorted the stock of his own bank, using a pair of companies he owned to make the trades. He was forced to resign from the Fed. In 1930, Whitney, the scion of a prominent New England family, became the president of the stock exchange, but he was ultimately exposed as an embezzler and served more than three years in Sing Sing. On being reminded of stories like these, it’s tempting to cast the leaders of nineteen-twenties Wall Street as a bunch of crooks. Sorkin resists the impulse. In an afterword, he writes, “The difficulty is that, other than the disgraced Richard Whitney and Albert Wiggin, it is hard to make the case that any of the era’s other major financial figures did anything appreciably worse than most individuals would have done in their positions and circumstances.” Given the role that Wall Street’s élite played in inflating and promoting the bubble, this is either a generous view or a jaded commentary on the fallen nature of mankind. In any case, though, it’s true that speculative booms tend to take on a life of their own, creating incentives and opportunities that warp people’s judgment at all levels of the economy, from small investors and professional intermediaries to major corporate and financial institutions. One aspect of the current boom that hasn’t received sufficient attention is how it has extended from the stock market to the credit markets, where there has been enormous growth in so-called “private lending” by non-bank institutions, including private-equity companies, hedge funds, and specialized credit firms. Last week, news organizations reported that the Department of Justice had opened an investigation into the collapse of First Brands, an acquisitive Cleveland-based auto-parts firm that, with Wall Street’s help, had apparently raised billions of dollars in opaque transactions. One creditor told a bankruptcy court that up to $2.3 billion in collateral had “simply vanished,” and called for the appointment of an independent examiner. A lawyer for First Brands said the company denied any wrongdoing and attributed the collapse to “macroeconomic factors” beyond its control. The sudden demise of a single highly leveraged company that operated in a sector far from the A.I. frontier may be a one-off event, with no broader implications. Or it could conceivably be a harbinger of what lies ahead. We won’t know for a while—perhaps a good while. But in the words of the nineteenth-century English journalist Walter Bagehot, whom Galbraith quoted, “every great crisis reveals the excessive speculations of many houses which no one before suspected.” This time is unlikely to be different. ♦

Title: OpenAI-Broadcom agreement sends shares of chipmaker soaring
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/10/13/openai-broadcom-chipmaker-artificial-intelligence-data-center/
Time Published: 2025-10-13T16:08:52Z

Broadcom Inc. shares jumped after OpenAI agreed to buy the company’s custom chips and networking equipment in a multiyear deal, part of an ambitious plan by the startup to add artificial intelligence infrastructure. In a pact announced Monday, OpenAI agreed to buy custom chips and networking components from Broadcom to help power its artificial intelligence services. OpenAI had already struck deals for data centers and chips that easily top $1 trillion, and the company plans to spend tens of billions of dollars more on Broadcom chips, according to people familiar with the matter. By customizing the processors, OpenAI said it will be able to embed what it has learned from developing AI models and services “directly into the hardware, unlocking new levels of capability and intelligence.” The hardware rollout should be completed by the end of 2029, according to the companies. For Broadcom, the move provides deeper access to the booming AI market. Monday’s agreement confirms an arrangement that Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan had hinted at during an earnings conference call last month. Investors sent Broadcom shares up as as much as 11% on Monday, betting that the OpenAI alliance will generate hundreds of billions of dollars in new revenue for the chipmaker. But the details of how OpenAI will pay for the equipment aren’t spelled out. While the AI startup has shown it can easily raise funding from investors, it’s burning through wads of cash and doesn’t expect to be cash-flow positive until around the end of this decade. OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, has inked a number of blockbuster deals this year, aiming to ease constraints on computing power. Nvidia Corp., whose chips handle the majority of AI work, said last month that it will invest as much as $100 billion in OpenAI to support new infrastructure — with a goal of at least 10 GW of capacity. And just last week, OpenAI announced a pact to deploy 6 GW of Advanced Micro Device Inc. processors over multiple years. As AI and cloud companies announce large projects every few days, it’s often not clear how the efforts are being financed. The interlocking deals also have boosted fears of a bubble in AI spending, particularly as many of these partnerships involve OpenAI, a fast-growing but unprofitable business. While purchasing chips from others, OpenAI has also been working on designing its own semiconductors. They’re mainly intended to handle the inference stage of running AI models — the phase after the technology is trained. There’s no investment or stock component to the Broadcom deal, OpenAI said, making it different than the agreements with Nvidia and AMD. An OpenAI spokesperson declined to comment on how the company will finance the chips, but the underlying idea is that more computing power will let the company sell more services. A single gigawatt of AI computing capacity today costs roughly $35 billion for the chips alone, with 10 GW totaling upwards of $350 billion. But a chief reason OpenAI is working to develop its own chip is to bring down its costs, and it’s unclear what price Broadcom’s chips will command under the deal. OpenAI might be trying to emulate Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which made its own chips using Broadcom’s technology and saw lower costs compared with other AI companies, such as Meta Platforms Inc., according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mandeep Singh. Google’s success with Broadcom might have steered OpenAI to that chipmaker, rather than suppliers such as Marvell Technology Inc., Singh added. In announcing the agreement, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that his company has been working with Broadcom for 18 months. The startup is rethinking technology starting with the transistors and going all the way up to what happens when someone asks ChatGPT a question, he said on a podcast released by his company. “By being able to optimize across that entire stack, we can get huge efficiency gains, and that will lead to much better performance, faster models, cheaper models.” When Tan referred to the agreement last month, he didn’t name the customer, though people familiar with the matter identified it as OpenAI. “If you do your own chips, you control your destiny,” Tan said in the podcast Monday. Broadcom has increasingly been seen as a key beneficiary of AI spending, helping propel its share price this year. The stock was up 40% so far this year through Friday’s close, outpacing a 29% gain by the benchmark Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index. OpenAI, meanwhile, has garnered a $500 billion valuation, making it the world’s biggest startup by that measure. By tapping Broadcom’s networking technology, OpenAI is hedging its bets. Broadcom’s Ethernet-based options compete with Nvidia’s proprietary technology. OpenAI also will be designing its own gear as part of its work on custom hardware, the startup said. Broadcom won’t be providing the data center capacity itself. Instead, it will deploy server racks with custom hardware to facilities run by either OpenAI or its cloud-computing partners. A single gigawatt is about the capacity of a conventional nuclear power plant. Still, 10 GW of computing power alone isn’t enough to support OpenAI’s vision of achieving artificial general intelligence, said OpenAI co-founder and President Greg Brockman. “That is a drop in the bucket compared to where we need to go,” he said. Getting to the level under discussion isn’t going to happen quickly, said Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s semiconductor solutions group. “Take railroads — it took about a century to roll it out as critical infrastructure. If you take the internet, it took about 30 years,” he said. “This is not going to take five years.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

OpenAI has partnered with Broadcom to produce its first in-house artificial intelligence processors, the latest chip tie-up for the ChatGPT maker as it races to secure the computing power needed to meet surging demand for its services. The companies said today that OpenAI would design the chips, which Broadcom will develop and deploy starting in the second half of 2026. They will roll out 10 gigawatts' worth of custom chips, whose power consumption is roughly equivalent to the needs of more than 8 million US households or five times the electricity produced by the Hoover Dam. The agreement is the latest in a string of massive AI chip investments that have highlighted the technology industry's surging appetite for computing power as it races to build systems that meet or surpass human intelligence. OpenAI last week unveiled a 6-gigawatt AI chip supply deal with AMD that includes an option to buy a stake in the chipmaker, days after disclosing that Nvidia plans to invest up to $100 billion in the startup and provide it with data centre systems with at least 10 gigawatts of capacity. "Partnering with Broadcom is a critical step in building the infrastructure needed to unlock AI's potential," OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. Financial details of the agreement were not disclosed and it was not immediately clear how OpenAI would fund the deal. The tie-up with Broadcom, first reported by Reuters last year, places OpenAI among cloud-computing giants such as Alphabet-owned Google and Amazon.com that are developing custom chips to meet surging AI demand and reduce dependence on Nvidia's costly processors that are limited in supply. The approach is not a sure bet. Similar efforts by Microsoft and Meta have run into delays or failed to match the performance of Nvidia chips, according to media reports, and analysts believe custom chips do not pose a threat to Nvidia's dominance in the short term. The rise of custom chips has, however, turned Broadcom - long known for its networking hardware - into one of the biggest winners of the generative AI boom, with its stock price rising nearly six-fold since the end of 2022. The company unveiled a blockbuster $10 billion custom AI chip order in September from an unnamed new customer that some analysts and market watchers speculated was OpenAI. Broadcom and OpenAI said today that the deployment of the new custom chips would be completed by the end of 2029, building on their existing co-development and supply agreements. The new systems will be scaled entirely using Broadcom's Ethernet and other networking gear, giving the company an edge over smaller rivals such as Marvell Technology and challenging Nvidia's InfiniBand networking solution. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Why Oracle Stock Rose 122% In 6 Months
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/13/why-oracle-stock-rose-122-in-6-months/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. From a quantitative perspective, the 122.2% change in Oracle (ORCL) stock between April 13, 2025, and October 10, 2025, was primarily driven by a 119.3% expansion in the company’s P/E multiple. There’s more to this story than numbers alone—but first, let’s break down the movement and its key contributors. Single stock can be risky, but there is a huge value to a broader diversified approach we take with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. We go beyond just equities. Is a portfolio of 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto in addition to equities and bonds - likely to return more during the next 1-3 years, and protect you better if markets crash 20%? We have crunched the numbers. Coming back to the "change": The change in fundamental factors such as valuation, revenue and margins, has an underlying business and investor sentiment story behind it. Below, we have identified key developments that influenced stock price movement for ORCL stock. Before that, as a quick background: ORCL provides cloud software as a service, industry-specific cloud solutions, application licenses, license support, an enterprise database, a development language, and middleware services. Opinion: We currently find ORCL stock relatively expensive. Why so? Have a look at the full story. Read Buy or Sell ORCL Stock to see what drives our current opinion. Risk: That said, Oracle isn’t immune to big drops. It plunged nearly 77% in the Dot-Com Bubble and slid over 41% during the Global Financial Crisis. The Inflation Shock wasn’t kind either, with a 40% dip. Even the smaller events — 2018 Correction and Covid Pandemic — pushed it down around 19% and 29% respectively. Solid fundamentals matter, but when sell-offs hit, Oracle can see serious pullbacks. Picking winners on a consistent basis is not an easy task - especially given the volatility associated with a single stock. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

October 12, 2025 19:30 ET | Source: Faraday Future Faraday Future LOS ANGELES, Oct. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or the “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today shared a weekly business update from YT Jia, Founder and Global Co-CEO of FF. “Welcome to the 24th issue of our Weekly Report. Sorry for showing up in a cap today. I’ve been dealing with a very serious case of shingles on my head these past few days, which has affected my condition a bit. Everyone, please also take good care of your health and get enough rest. On EAI Flywheel this week, starting with S1 User Ecosystem: This week, FX signed a deposit agreement for 1,000 units of FX Super One with ZEVO, the pioneer of peer-to-peer EV sharing platform in the U.S. The agreement includes non-refundable deposits and non-binding preorders, and the non-refundable deposit has already been received. The signing of this agreement not only marks that FX’s Co-Creation Ecosystem Online Direct Sales model has expanded into Texas, the second-largest EV market in the United States. It also represents another innovative breakthrough in our B2B2C sales model. Following the car rental, FX Par, real estate brokerage, and MCN agencies, FX has now also entered the rapidly growing peer-to-peer car-sharing market. Based in Dallas, ZEVO not only allows individual car owners to list their own EVs for user-to-user sharing but also provides flexible short-term rental programs for ride-hailing and instant-delivery drivers. Its business has now expanded to core cities in Texas, California, Arizona, Florida, and Nevada. Through the cooperation with ZEVO, FX not only further expands the sales and use cases of FX Super One, but is also expected to speed up the implementation of our co-creation and sharing ecosystem. At the same time, when the car-sharing business and CXC10’s Three Growth Engines spark meta-chemistry — especially through the EAI + Crypto Dual-Bridge RWA products — new possibilities will emerge. The value of real-world mobility will be redefined and expanded in Web3 scenarios. This meta-chemistry could greatly accelerate the convergence of Web2 and Web3, and of EAI and Crypto, creating the greatest value for our stockholders. This week, we also held a "Car Home Crypto Co-Creation" delivery event with Pinnacle. Calvin Gong is our first Co-Creation Officer since we announced the “EAI + Crypto” Dual Flywheel & Dual Bridge Eco-Strategy. We look forward to creating meta-chemistry between real estate, automotive, and crypto together with industry leaders like Pinnacle. This could help us co-create greater value and enable users to share more benefits. Now going to S2-4 Product & Technology, Supply Chain, Production & Delivery: The FX Super One U.S. year-end vehicle off-line target has officially entered the final two-month sprint stage. This week, the company established a dedicated project team to coordinate and drive the work. Key areas — including engineering, supply chain, homologation, manufacturing and so on— are all accelerating across the board. On S6 Middle East: Our global teams are working across three locations in full force to prepare for the October 28th UAE Super One Product Final Launch. As the strategic third pole, the UAE will host its major Super One product launch for the first time and take the lead in initial vehicle deliveries — a milestone of great significance for FF and FX’s global strategic layout. The experience gained through this event will also help ensure the smooth progress of the upcoming vehicle off-line and final launch activities in the U.S. Going to S7, Capability and System Build-Up: This week, members of our government affairs team were invited to attend a gala in Washington D.C. that brought together political, media and entrepreneurial leaders from across the U.S. We continue to strengthen our government affairs capabilities, and they are making progress assisting the company in public sector engagement, policy incentives, tariff strategy, and more. Now let’s look at the Crypto flywheel: Following the completion of the strategic investment in Qualigen (QLGN), the Crypto team has been advancing its business operations while accelerating the transition work. The special meeting of QLGN stockholders is currently scheduled for November 2025. If the transaction is approved, QLGN is expected to be rebranded as CXC10, marking the beginning of a new chapter in Crypto and AI operations for that company. Next week, we will announce a major milestone related to the first FX Super One vehicle off-line target in the United States. Please stay tuned for the update. Okay, I'll see you later.” ABOUT FARADAY FUTURE Faraday Future is a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company.

Title: The Digital Asset Treasury Playbook: How to Print, Buy and Compound to ‘Alchemise’ mNAV into a Market Engine

About us Copy link Just a couple months ago, digital asset treasuries were crypto’s hottest trade. Spurred by soaring valuations, hundreds of companies raced to accumulate Bitcoin, Ether, and other digital assets. The mania has cooled in recent weeks. Companies that saw their stock soar after announcing multimillion-dollar crypto purchases are now trading at a discount relative to that crypto. Still, some are holding strong, with their mNAV — short for market-cap-to-net-asset-value multiple — comfortably in the black. How do the do it? In the LlamaU article below, pseudonymous DefiLlama analyst Meta explains the drivers of mNAV premiums, as well as examples where the logic behind those premiums “breaks.” (Read Meta’s previous article: What is mNAV? How to calculate and trade it? Your DefiLlama guide to the metric for digital asset treasuries) DATs are no longer just holding crypto — they’re leveraged to actively expand their own holdings and valuations. They aren’t just ‘hodl’ing tokens; it has become a competitive game of accumulation. DATs are trading their own market caps against themselves, turning investor sentiment into capital and capital into narrative fuel. This new species of equity, known as Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs), sits at the intersection of corporate finance and crypto reflexivity. Their fundamentals are blockchain-based, their premiums narrative-driven, and their strategies systematic: print, buy, compound, repeat. What began as an experiment with MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin accumulation model has evolved into a broader movement spanning Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and beyond. Today, SBET, BMNR, and others have creatively applied the same reflexive mechanics to staking yield, token diversification, and capital recycling; transforming what used to be static balance sheets into market engines. mNAV = Fully Diluted Market Cap ÷ Treasury Value (USD) 1.0x → equity equals treasury value (fair) > 1.0x → investors pay a premium for leverage, yield, or access < 1.0x → the stock trades at a discount to its underlying crypto If you’re new to mNAV or want a step-by-step breakdown of how it’s calculated, “HYPE DAT Ecosystem: A Clean Case Study for mNAV” is where you want to start. A premium can be narrative-driven, structural, engineered, or yield-supported. When these align, mNAV becomes less a ratio and more a reaction: a positive feedback loop between equity and treasury that refines sentiment into capital. MicroStrategy pioneered the quintessential DAT model; they codified, refined, and evolved their procedure making them the gold standard. Below is the company’s official equity guidance slide from Exhibit 99.1 (August 2025): MSTR Equity Guidance screenshot MicroStrategy pioneered the quintessential DAT model. Its strategy slide divides valuation into mNAV zones, each dictating a different capital playbook: - Active: issue equity aggressively to buy more Bitcoin - Opportunistic: issue selectively during favorable sentiment - Tactical: issue sparingly for debt or liquidity needs - Defensive: may use credit to repurchase stock Active issuance expands Bitcoin holdings through ATMs (At-the-Market equity offering, where companies sell newly issued shares directly on to the open market), convertibles, and secondary offerings. Opportunistic issuance occurs briefly, often above 3x mNAV, allowing controlled compounding with minimal dilution. Tactical issuance covers debt or dividends without selling BTC. Defensive stance slows issuance or uses credit to repurchase shares, supporting the stock’s floor and resetting the flywheel. This structure turns capital markets into a feedback engine. When mNAV rises, MicroStrategy issues to buy BTC. When it falls, issuance tightens or reverses through buybacks. Dilution becomes reflexive compounding. The simplest catalyst for premiums or discounts is positioning versus entry cost. When a DAT’s treasury sits above its average purchase price, the market usually assigns a premium (>1x mNAV). Below cost, the market discounts it. Across the DeFiLlama Digital Asset Treasuries dashboard, profitable treasuries consistently trade higher while underwater ones remain cheap. Examples include: - MSTR (MicroStrategy) — BTC Treasury, Above Basis → Premium (mNAV ~1.5x) - KIDZ (Classover) — SOL Treasury, Above Basis → Premium (mNAV 2.1x–3.5x) - UPXI (Upexi) — SOL Treasury, Max FD lens → mNAV ~1.5x - MARA (Marathon Digital) — BTC + Infrastructure Premium (1.2x–1.7x) - NAKA (Nakamoto Holdings) — High BTC Entry → Discount (0.5x–0.8x) - BTBT (Bit Digital) — ETH Treasury w/ Yield → Premium (>1x) Premiums also form along jurisdictional and regulatory lines — where access or taxation changes valuation dynamics. Metaplanet Inc. (OTC: MTPLF, TSE: 3350.T) is Japan’s flagship Bitcoin treasury and one of the clearest cases of jurisdictional alchemy. Under Japan’s tax code, corporations must mark crypto holdings to market annually and pay tax on unrealized gains. In contrast, capital gains on listed shares are taxed separately at an effective 20.315% (Japan National Tax Agency). This makes Metaplanet (MTPLF) a tax-deferred Bitcoin proxy, letting investors gain BTC exposure through equity. By holding Bitcoin through equity rather than directly, Metaplanet turns that asymmetry into a structural advantage, maintaining a 1.8x–2.0x mNAV with it at its peak having maintained >8x mNAV for weeks on end. A textbook case of tax alchemy: turning friction into premium. DATs in regulated markets can tap capital barred from direct token exposure. MicroStrategy succeeded because it epitomized this: a compliant, levered Bitcoin wrapper for institutions. Formerly CEA Industries, BNB Network Co. (BNC) is one of the few public DATs with direct BNB exposure. With no BNB ETF or trust in the U.S., it serves as a listed proxy for Binance’s ecosystem; similar to how MSTR fulfilled the role early on as the only institutional onramp for BTC exposure. It trades near 1.87x mNAV. Given that it is publicly endorsed and heavily invested into BNB DAT by the venture capital entity YZI Labs, formerly Binance Labs, which is officially funded and partnered with Binance itself. Until a formal BNB ETF exists, that scarcity alone supports the premium. Together, Metaplanet and BNB Network Co. show the geography of premium. Where Metaplanet turns Japan’s crypto tax disadvantage into equity advantage, BNC leverages America’s regulatory bottleneck on BNB exposure. Both convert policy friction into scarcity. Metaplanet provides the purest example of geopolitical arbitrage in the DAT playbook. SBET and BMNR pioneered ETH-based treasuries that generate yield natively. By staking directly on Ethereum, both earn validator-level returns (~3–5% APY) that continuously expand NAV. That yield compounds through feedback: staking generates rewards, NAV expands, the market reprices equity upward, and higher valuations reinforce the premium. The difference lies in the ingredients: mindshare, leadership, and visibility. SBET, with Joseph Lubin, cofounder of Ethereum, and Joseph Chalom, former Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock, has top tier pedigree however BMNR’s Tom Lee has a very public presence with his appearances on CNBC. This ends up likening Tom Lee to MSTR’s legendary Saylor whose loud, consistent, charismatic bullishness were undeniable variables in the success of establishing MicroStrategy as a household name. BMNR paralleled this best for the Ethereum DATS by staying on top via a combination of buybacks, retail engagement, and visible leadership. BTCS also earns ETH staking yield but trades below parity lending proof that yield alone can’t ignite the flywheel without narrative and conviction. Ultimately, yield is the base metal, and narrative, leadership, and timing are the reagents that determine whether it compounds or burns off. Some DATs diversify through moonshot allocations: small, high-beta bets meant to amplify upside or hedge decay. GameSquare (mNAV = ~1.11x) holds ETH, a CryptoPunk, and ANIME token positions. It trades slightly above parity, a modest premium for narrative diversification. BMNR allocated $20M into ORBS (formerly OCTO), a Worldcoin (WLD) DAT, at $1.46/share. By October 2025, ORBS traded above $10, a 6x gain. Clearly, these moonshots can convert asymmetric exposure into subtle mNAV leverage through optionality. Not all DATs follow the “profit = premium” or “association = value” logic. TRON (Ticker: TRON) – Despite profitable reserves and close ties to the TRON blockchain, the stock trades at a steep discount. TRON, which is the only TRX DAT treasury, trades at a 0.53x max fully diluted mNAV, Despite TRX hosting ~$77.5B in stablecoins, composed of ~98% USDT (DeFiLlama), and dominating transfers across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, in the West, it’s viewed as a transactional rail, not an investable asset, keeping its mNAV deeply discounted. Contrast this with BNB Network Co. (BNC). BNB’s exchange linkage and predictable revenue burns make it behave like equity. Binance uses a share of revenue to buy and burn BNB: a deliberate, showy, aggressive mechanism versus TRX’s passive gas burns. Traditional finance investors quickly recognize the pattern as an equity-like feedback loop, sustaining BNC’s 1.87x mNAV whereas TRX’s gas burning blockchain hasn’t attracted attention to TRON treasury keeping it below parity. Simply put: BNB’s burn program mirrors corporate buybacks, while TRX’s gas burns are passive and minor in comparison. BNC maintains premium; TRON does not. In numerical terms, the contrast between the two when examining max mNAV is astronomical: a difference of over 300%! BTCS, one of the first ETH staking firms, trades around 0.88x mNAV. SBET and BMNR captured attention with clear messaging and buybacks; BTCS remained quieter, focused on infrastructure over narrative. It delivers on-chain results but lacks social reflexivity; proof that legitimacy without visibility still prices like a discount. These cases show DAT premiums are behavioral, not mechanical. Narrative clarity, investor access, and perceived intentionality decide whether association becomes valuation. TRX dominates usage but not mindshare translating to a discount for TRON; BNB’s engineered burn loop mirrors equity translating to a premium for BNC as if accounting for revenue generation; and BTCS shows substance alone isn’t enough. In this market, numbers matter but narratives are the driver for positive multiples. In the DAT ecosystem, premiums aren’t random; they’re engineered. Every successful treasury blends fundamentals, narrative, and structure into a reflexive loop: fundamentals anchor value, narrative amplifies it, and capital strategy turns that feedback into growth. MicroStrategy utilizes financial wizardry to convert sentiment into Bitcoin. Metaplanet and BNC alchemize geography into premium through geopolitical arbitrage. BMNR, SBET, and GAME merge yield and narrative momentum. TRON and BTCS remind us that usage without story rarely sustains a premium. In this financial alchemy, fundamentals are the lead, narrative is the spark, and regulation is the catalyst that determines how brightly it burns.

Title: Nvidia's AI empire: A look at its top startup investments | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us No company has capitalized on the AI revolution more dramatically than Nvidia. Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over two years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. Its stock price has soared, making it a $4.5 trillion market cap company. The world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in startups, particularly in AI. Nvidia has participated in 50 venture capital deals so far in 2025, already surpassing the 48 deals the company completed in all of 2024, according to PitchBook data. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly increased its investment pace over that period. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 21 deals this year, compared to just one in 2022.) Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.” Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million since 2023 where Nvidia is a named participant, organized from the highest to lowest amount raised in the round. This list shows just how far and wide Nvidia has spread its tentacles in the tech industry, beyond supplying its products. OpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October 2024, reportedly writing a $100 million check as part of a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which according to The New York Times invested $1.3 billion. While PitchBook data indicates Nvidia did not participate in OpenAI’s $40 billion funding round that closed in March, the chipmaker announced in September that it would invest up to $100 billion in the company over time, structured as a strategic partnership to deploy massive AI infrastructure. xAI: In 2024, OpenAI tried to persuade its investors not to invest in any of its rivals. But Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI last December anyway. Nvidia will also invest up to $2 billion in the equity portion of xAI’s planned $20 billion funding round, Bloomberg reported, a deal structured to help xAI purchase more Nvidia gear. Mistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the third time when the French-based large language model (LLM) developer raised a €1.7 billion (about $2 billion) Series C at a €11.7billion ($13.5 billion) post-money valuation in September. Reflection AI: In October, Nvidia was one of the most significant investors in Reflection AI, contributing to a $2 billion funding round that valued the one-year-old startup at $8 billion. Reflection AI is positioning itself as a U.S.-based competitor to Chinese DeepSeek, whose open source LLM offers a less-expensive alternative to closed source models from companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic. Thinking Machines Lab: Nvidia was among a long list of investors who backed former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab’s $2 billion seed round. The funding, which was formally announced in July, valued the new AI startup at $12 billion. Inflection: One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the more unusual (but increasingly common) outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company co-founded by Mustafa Suleyman, the famed founder of DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future. Nscale: After the startup’s $1.1 billion round in September, Nvidia participated in Nscale’s $433 million SAFE funding in October. That’s a deal that secures future equity for investors. Nscale, which formed in 2023 after spinning out of Australian cryptocurrency mining company Arkon Energy, is building data centers in the U.K. and Norway for OpenAI’s Stargate project. Wayve: In May 2024, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. Nvidia is expected to invest an additional $500 million in Wayve, the startup told TechCrunch in September. Wayve is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area. Figure AI: In September, Nvidia participated in Figure AI’s Series C funding round of over $1 billion, which valued the humanoid robotics startup at $39 billion. The chipmaker first invested in Figure in February 2024 when the company raised a $675 million Series B round at a $2.6 billion valuation. Scale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. In June, Meta invested $14.3 billion for a 49% stake of Scale and hired away the company’s co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang, as well as several other key Scale employees. Commonwealth Fusion: The chipmaker participated in the nuclear fusion-energy startup’s $863 million funding round in August 2025. The deal, which also included investors like Google and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, valued the company at $3 billion. Crusoe: A startup building data centers reportedly to be leased to Oracle, Microsoft, and OpenAI raised $686 million in November 2024, according to an SEC filing. The investment was led by Founders Fund, and the long list of other investors included Nvidia.

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. One company is more valuable than all the listed companies in Canada, or the UK, or Germany, writes Mark Lister. THE FACTS It’s been a fantastic run for the United States sharemarket. The S&P 500 index is up 18% in the past 12 months, and 83% over three years. Even Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has commented on this, noting that “equity prices are fairly highly valued” during a recent speech. To be fair, he was responding to a question, rather than feeling the need to proactively offer an opinion. For the record, I don’t believe US stocks are in a bubble. I do, however, agree they’re looking pricey. That means investors need to tread carefully, and think a little harder about how they spread their exposures. Valuations for the US market are at the highest levels we’ve seen in some time. The widely used price/earnings (PE) ratio is 22.8, well above the average since 1990 of 16.6 and the 18.7 average of the last decade. The only time it’s been higher was in the late 1990s, in the days that preceded the dotcom boom and bust. Things are eerily similar today, with the market strength being driven largely by companies associated with AI trends. The big three – Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple – together make up more than one-fifth of the S&P 500. Last month Deutsche Bank produced a fascinating chart to really put this into perspective. It showed how Nvidia’s market value had surpassed the total value of every country in the world’s entire listed stock exchange apart from the US, China, Japan and India. Let that sink in. One company is more valuable than all the listed companies in Canada, or the UK, or Germany. The US market is more concentrated than we’ve seen in decades and while that’s a risk, it also makes those PE comparisons less useful. The tech behemoths of 2025 have increasingly dominant positions, high margins and very profitable business models. Can you really compare them with the biggest companies of 20 years ago? In 2005 Exxon Mobil was the largest stock on the market, while Citigroup, General Electric and Walmart were in the top five. The earnings power of this class of 2025 is hugely exciting, if you’re a believer in the productivity growth potential of AI. It can’t be overstated how important this is, because it’s earnings growth that ultimately drives share prices (at least in the longer term). Earnings for the US tech sector grew 23% in the June quarter, relative to a year ago. The communication services sector (where the likes of Meta and Alphabet reside) saw an even larger gain of 46%. Looking ahead to 2026, analysts are projecting earnings growth for the S&P 500 index of almost 14%, double the long-term average of about 7%. The so-called Magnificent 7 are expected to contribute as much as two-thirds of this. Even if the earnings tailwinds can justify the higher valuations and keep pushing the US market higher, there’s a strong case for diversification right now. Other sharemarkets look more reasonable when we compare current valuations to long-term averages. The UK and Europe are trading in line with history, emerging market shares are only slightly higher, while Japan looks cheaper. Even within the US itself, there are sectors which have lagged and look better value. Healthcare, energy and real estate are trading in line with their longer-term average PE, while utilities and consumer staples are only at a modest premium. Each of those regions and sectors will be facing its own unique backdrop, and valuation alone isn’t an indicator of where prices will go in the next year or two. However, for investors feeling uneasy about the ongoing strength of American equities, there are plenty of ways to hedge your bets. Valuations across the US sharemarket are indeed high, but it could keep performing well if the economy remains resilient, the Fed keeps reducing interest rates and the tech sector keeps delivering solid earnings. At the same time, it would be unwise to ignore the risk things are a little overdone. The astute investor is probably ensuring they have an exposure to markets outside the US, while maintaining a healthy foothold in the world’s biggest economy.
