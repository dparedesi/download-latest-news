Posted on September 12, 2025 by Nick Roach 1 Comment The Divi 5 Public Alpha is available for use on new websites. If you use Divi 5, you‚Äôll notice an update notification for Public Alpha Version 23. We release new Divi 5 versions every two weeks, and it gets better each time. If you haven‚Äôt tested Divi 5 yet, try it and let us know what you think. I didn‚Äôt post an update for Public Alpha 22, so this post will cover everything new in Public Alpha 22 and Public Alpha 23. Since Public Alpha 21, we implemented 247 bug fixes and improvements and released two new features, including the new Responsive Editor and Custom Attributes. You‚Äôll notice the bug fixing has ramped up significantly as we near the beta launch, and the team has transitioned away from feature development. Even though the development team is focused on fixing bugs and prepping for the beta launch, I found time to squeeze in a couple of surprise features. Custom Attributes were released in Divi 5 Public Alpha 23. üéâ This new feature allows you to add any attribute, such as alt, title, rel, and aria-label, to elements and most sub-elements. Divi has had support for specific attributes, such as class and ID, but now you can add any attribute to any element. This is especially important for accessibility, allowing you to, for example, add alt text to images, and roles and labels to non-semantic elements like an icon-based button. The new Responsive Editor was released in Divi 5 Public Alpha 22. üéâ This editor lets you quickly view, modify, and reset the responsive, hover, and sticky states for any setting while in any view mode. In Divi 5, you get the best of both worlds: natural, intuitive editing, where all changes made while in a particular view mode apply automatically, and the new responsive editor, which allows you to make swift changes to all states at any time. Here is a list of all the changes implemented since Public Alpha 21. It‚Äôs important to note that Divi 5 is production-ready for use on new websites today! Due to the scope of the Divi 5 project, we took a non-traditional approach to its release schedule, releasing it in five phases. The ultimate goal is to make Divi 5 as helpful as possible, as soon as possible, to as many people as possible. We are in the Alpha phase, akin to ‚ÄúDivi 5 Lite.‚Äù It‚Äôs missing a few features, but what‚Äôs done is ready to be used. It‚Äôs far superior to Divi 4 in almost every way. If you prefer Divi 5, you can use it to build new websites. We aim to enter beta in ~1 month. Almost the entire team is focused on cleaning up the remaining bugs, and we‚Äôll launch the beta as soon as we are confident that we have cleaned up the worst of them. The date we launch the beat will depend on the volume of new bugs reported over the next few weeks. Divi 5 will reach its ‚Äúfinal form‚Äù before the end of the year, with the ultimate goal of leapfrogging the competition before the year ends. Part of that goal involves aggressively developing new features as part of the feature swap. But don‚Äôt forget! Between now and then, you can use Divi 5 whenever it becomes your preferred experience. Instead of rushing to a final release, we‚Äôre maintaining both Divi 4 and Divi 5, giving users a choice. Once we‚Äôre confident in removing that choice, we‚Äôll make it official, and everyone will get the Divi 5 upgrade notification. The Divi 5 Public Alpha is available today. Give it a try, and let us know what you think! If you find a bug, report it to our team, and we‚Äôll fix it. We‚Äôll continue to work aggressively to add new features and address feedback.

Title: The new frontier: Meet the power players cashing in on the AI gold rush

As hundreds of billions pour into data center development, these are the names making a killing from AI investments. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here‚Äôs how it works. If there is one unifying theme across the entire AI industry over the past year, it has been staggering, unprecedented investment. Hundreds of billions of dollars have poured into companies the world over, promising enormous innovation and profit-making opportunities in equal measure. Governments and private enterprises have scrambled to keep pace with its rapid evolution, and even if the biggest companies haven't managed to make a profit just yet, that's not stopping the investor dollars from flowing in. That's largely to the benefit of the companies receiving that level of interest and backing, but most of those companies are headed by individuals with large stakes in them. As those investments were announced and company stock prices ballooned in response, so did the personal fortunes of CEOs, founders, and investors, to truly eye-watering levels. Oracle's Larry Ellison "made" over $100 billion in a single day when it was announced his company had struck a $300 billion infrastructure deal with OpenAI over five years, catapulting him into position as the world's richest person overnight. He's far from an isolated example. We've collated a list of notable names who have been the biggest benefactors in the ongoing AI boom. Jensen Huang founded Nvidia in a Denny's in 1993 and, until the mid-2010s, was primarily known within the relatively niche world of PC gaming enthusiasts. However, in the latter years of the decade, he was tipped by Fortune to power the AI revolution, and from the back of that, his personal wealth exploded. By 2019, he was worth $3 billion, ballooning to $100 billion by mid-2024, and reaching a peak of $243 billion in August 2025, before falling to around $157 billion at the time of writing. This tracks almost exclusively with the Nvidia share price. Huang maintains around 3.8% of the company and remains its largest shareholder. Huang is one of the many AI CEOs spearheading the enormous global investment in AI, promising to help build as much as $500 billion in "AI factory" data centers in the U.S. alone by 2029. Even if he doesn't quite hit that milestone, though, Nvidia GPUs are the fastest and most capable for AI training and inference, and that sees no sign of slowing. As the head of the world's most valuable company at the forefront of the hottest investment industry in the world, it would be no surprise to see Huang's personal wealth continue to grow in the years to come. Huang has maneuvered Nvidia into a keystone position in this burgeoning industry. While the likes of Meta used to train its AI on internally developed hardware, today, they use Nvidia GPUs. As does xAI, and OpenAI. Even though Chinese developers can't get the best Nvidia GPUs, they've still bought up H20s in the hundreds of thousands. The plan moving forward is to continue the upsell. Nvidia recently announced its Blackwell Ultra GB300 GPU platform, which is multiple times faster for AI inference workloads than older Hopper-based designs, and allegedly up to 45% faster running DeepSeek than even existing Blackwell GPUs, like the GB200. Huang is taking the yearly upgrade model that turned Nvidia into a leading gaming business, and applying it to AI and data centers. He's encouraging the building of "AI factories," which are described like money printers: GPUs and electricity go in one end, and money comes out the other. Nvidia wants to sell the world on the "economics of inference," and it wants to sell them the hardware to help them benefit. The new richest man in the world, Larry Ellison is worth $383 billion at the time of writing. He founded the company that would become Oracle in 1977, and remained its CEO until mid-2014, though he retains roles as the CTO and executive chairman. He has a range of business investments that make up his expansive portfolio, including 10s of millions of Tesla shares, and a commanding stake in Paramount Skydance. But it's his 40% stake in Oracle that has seen his net worth expand so rapidly in recent years. In 2020, he was worth around $67 billion, but by 2025, when Oracle was announced as a partner in the massive Stargate project, his net worth began to skyrocket. By mid-2025, it was over $200 billion, and following the announcement of another $300 billion partnership with OpenAI, he became the world's richest man; at least, temporarily. Staying there may depend on the real-world feasibility of the deal. Although Oracle is a company worth in excess of $600 billion, it holds a lot of debt, and will reportedly need to take on a lot more of it to secure the hardware and build the infrastructure it will need to supply OpenAI in the first place. On top of that, OpenAI will have to figure out how to pay for it. With its revenue for 2025 predicted to be between $15 and $20 billion, and none of it profit, it doesn't even generate enough to pay for a portion of a single year of this deal. And still, it's been struck and confident plans made for its commencement in 2027. Oracle has announced its intention to build data center facilities in Wyoming, Pennsylvania, Texas, Michigan, and New Mexico with partner firm Crusoe. With much of Oracle and Ellison's value now resting on the projected annual revenue from this OpenAI deal, both companies will need to follow through to keep Oracle riding high. The youngest member of this list, Alexandr Wang is the current chief AI officer at Meta, a role he received after Mark Zuckerberg invested over $14 billion in his company, Scale AI, pushing his personal net worth up to $3.2 billion. He founded Scale AI in 2016, aged just 19, as a data labeling and model evaluation service. Within five years, the company was worth over $7 billion, and Wang's personal net worth reached a billion for the first time. Wang is estimated to maintain a 5% stake in Scale AI, though the company is not publicly traded, so it's unknown how much any such stake would be worth. Wang is now a prominent figure within Meta and is effectively the head of its AI developments, though presumably with some deference to Mark Zuckerberg. He'll be looking to spearhead Meta's plans for AI superintelligence. Although it doesn't have a definitive definition, it's a lofty goal the company is targeting in an effort to leapfrog the immediate efforts of its contemporaries. Scale AI will run in his absence, but it seems likely to slowly pivot to more government and militaristic roles in the years to come. Wang has been a consistent presence within the tech circles of the Trump administration, and Scale AI has signed deals in 2025 with the United States Department of Defence to use AI to plan ship movements and with the Qatari government to use AI tools in predictive analytics. A fixture on billionaire lists of all kinds for the best part of 20 years, Mark Zuckerberg pivoted from hyping the metaverse to pushing the AI future after the success of ChatGPT in 2022/2023 - although Meta AI has been a branch of Meta since 2013 (then called Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research). Although Meta has largely garnered AI-related headlines for its spending habits more than its products, it's still a major player in the AI space, and Zuckerberg has pushed artificial intelligence development as one of the core products of his company moving forward. Much like the Metaverse was before it. Perhaps that's why Zuckerberg's personal wealth hasn't ballooned quite like some of the others on this list, but he still has one of the largest single-day value pops on his resum√©. In July 2025, his net worth leapt over $28 billion in a single day after the Meta stock jumped following strong revenue reports. However, at the time, investors were seemingly excited by the potential of Meta's AI investments, which had been aggressive, especially with regard to bringing in talent like Alexandr Wang. Zuckerberg has set his AI sights higher than most, though. Where OpenAI, xAI, and Anthropic are mostly focused on developing functional AI tools today, Meta isn't competing directly and is instead said to be focusing its research efforts on developing "super intelligence." This would be an AI model with greater than human-level intelligence. It would need to be more functional and capable than even general intelligence AI, or AGI, which is seen as the goal of many AI research and development projects. But since no one has clearly defined that, or shown any sign we're close to such a breakthrough, the idea of doing something much more capable than that in the near term is hard to imagine. Elon Musk is a divisive figure with fingers in many pies. While most of his wealth derives from shares in Tesla and SpaceX, he is also a majority shareholder in xAI, which produces the Grok artificial intelligence most commonly used on Twitter/X. When Musk used xAI to purchase X Corp (X's parent company) in March 2025, it valued the combined holdings of the two companies at $80 billion. He's since gone on to announce he's buying an entire power plant to run AI inference, and hopes to buy 50 million Nvidia GPUs. The xAI valuation contributes mightily to Musk's total net worth of around $400 billion, depending on market fluctuations (at the time of writing, Larry Ellison and he are bouncing back and forth for the top spot). This is close to double his net worth from 2022, but while his AI endeavours have contributed to that, it's the Tesla share price that has been the main driver of his wealth generation. What's next for Musk and his AI efforts is hard to pin down. He's always talked a big game about his companies and services, whether it's promising self-driving cars within two years over a decade ago, or reaching Mars before 2030. His latest claims are that AI will be smarter than a human by 2026 and smarter than the combined intelligence of all humans by 2030. He wasn't clear whether Grok would be the AI to make that achievement. More recently, Grok has been embroiled in scandals where it praised Hitler and allows users to create sexually-explicit deepfakes of celebrities. Even if superintelligence is possible with large language models, there's still a lot of work to do before we get there with the current crop of options. Many figures on this list, such as Musk, Alexandr Wang, Zuckerberg, and more, are all embroiled in a race to develop the most cutting-edge AI models possible. However, Jensen Huang's Nvidia is selling the most powerful chips to power it all. The outlook remains fierce, and with investors still clearly interested in the potential of AI, there could still be billions more to be made for the top names at all of these companies. As the AI race marches on and deals are being struck to democratize AI usage among people and populations, it's clear that the genie won't be going back in the bottle any time soon, even if OpenAI's Sam Altman admits that investors remain "overexcited" about AI.

Title: 'Bond King' Bill Gross says he's worried AI giants are wasting money ‚Äî and their stocks could pay the price

US tech titans are spending huge sums to win the AI race ‚Äî and the ones that lose could see their stock prices take a hit, "Bond King" Bill Gross has warned. The billionaire investor gave his thoughts to Business Insider after Oracle's market value surged by as much as 43%, or nearly $300 billion, on Wednesday, thanks to an AI-driven revenue projection. "My biggest concern is what economists refer to as 'malinvestment,' Gross said in an email. Gross ‚Äî who cofounded the fixed-income titan PIMCO and grew its flagship Total Return Fund to $270 billion over nearly three decades ‚Äî said the tech giants are racing to dominate various AI sectors and "seem willing to risk over-investment in hopes of future monopolies." "Some will fail and current trends ‚Äî and stock prices based on them ‚Äî may experience significantly reduced growth," Gross said. He singled out AI data centers and the "hundreds of billions" being spent on them by companies like Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle. Electricity providers are also "gearing up to supply them," he added. AI companies are investing vast sums in microchips, servers, and other infrastructure they need to build and train increasingly advanced models and harness AI in other ways. Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Alphabet are poised to invest more than $300 billion into AI this year. The immense buzz around AI has lit a fire under tech stocks. Shares of the nine most valuable tech companies ‚Äî Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Broadcom, Tesla, and Oracle ‚Äî have all more than doubled since the start of 2023, with Nvidia surging about 12-fold and Meta leaping around six-fold. The group's combined market value now exceeds $22 trillion. Jump to

Title: Larry Ellison is back on top, 48 years after he co-founded Oracle

Business FILE PHOTO: Larry Ellison reacts, at the White House, in Washington, U.S. February 3, 2025. REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz/File photo SAN FRANCISCO :Fortune magazine wondered on its cover whether Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison might become the world's richest person, while BusinessWeek declared Ellison is "cool again," noting that "Silicon Valley's bad boy is having his revenge." Both were published 25 years ago, but they could've run this week. The octogenarian Ellison is back in headlines after Oracle announced a clutch of cloud computing deals that rocked the tech world and sent its stock up 35.9 per cent, putting Ellison's fortune close to $400 billion, second globally only to Elon Musk. Then on Thursday, news broke that Paramount, the media conglomerate Ellison's family now controls, is preparing a bid to buy out the storied Warner Bros Discovery, threatening overnight to dominate Hollywood and culture. The swashbuckling billionaire may have been known more for his yacht collection, his ownership of a Hawaiian island or his longstanding support of Donald Trump.

View all partners https://doi.org/10.64628/AA.wdun44ema Share article Print article Just for a moment this week, Larry Ellison, co-founder of US cloud computing company Oracle, became the world‚Äôs richest person. The octogenarian tech titan briefly overtook Elon Musk after Oracle‚Äôs share price rocketed 43% in a day, adding about US$100 billion (A$150 billion) to his wealth. The reason? Oracle inked a deal to provide artificial intelligence (AI) giant OpenAI with US$300 billion (A$450 billion) in computing power over five years. While Ellison‚Äôs moment in the spotlight was fleeting, it also illuminated something far more significant: AI has created extraordinary levels of concentration in global financial markets. This raises an uncomfortable question not only for seasoned investors ‚Äì but also for everyday Australians who hold shares in AI companies via their superannuation. Just how exposed are even our supposedly ‚Äúsafe‚Äù, ‚Äúdiversified‚Äù investments to the AI boom? As billionaires go, Ellison isn‚Äôt as much of a household name as Tesla and SpaceX‚Äôs Musk or Amazon‚Äôs Jeff Bezos. But he‚Äôs been building wealth from enterprise technology for nearly five decades. Ellison co-founded Oracle in 1977, transforming it into one of the world‚Äôs largest database software companies. For decades, Oracle provided the unglamorous but essential plumbing that kept many corporate systems running. The AI revolution changed everything. Oracle‚Äôs cloud computing infrastructure, which helps companies store and process vast amounts of data, became critical infrastructure for the AI boom. Every time a company wants to train large language models or run machine learning algorithms, they need huge amounts of computing power and data storage. That‚Äôs precisely where Oracle excels. When Oracle reported stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings this week, driven largely by soaring AI demand, its share price spiked. That response wasn‚Äôt just about Oracle‚Äôs business fundamentals. It was about the entire AI ecosystem that has been reshaping global markets since ChatGPT‚Äôs public debut in late 2022. Oracle‚Äôs story is part of a much larger phenomenon reshaping global markets. The so-called ‚ÄúMagnificent Seven‚Äù tech stocks ‚Äì Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Tesla and Nvidia ‚Äì now control an unprecedented share of major stock indices. Year-to-date in 2025, these seven companies have come to represent approximately 39% of the US S&P500‚Äôs total value. For the tech-heavy NASDAQ100, the figure is a whopping 74%. This means if you invest in an exchange-traded fund that tracks the S&P500 index, often considered the gold standard of diversified investing, you‚Äôre making an increasingly concentrated bet on AI, whether you realise it or not. This level of concentration has not been seen since the late 1990s. Back then, investors were swept up in ‚Äúdot-com mania‚Äù, driving technology stock prices to unsustainable levels. When reality finally hit in March 2000, the tech-heavy Nasdaq crashed 77% over two years, wiping out trillions in wealth. Today‚Äôs AI concentration raises some similar red flags. Nvidia, which controls an estimated 90% of the AI chip market, currently trades at more than 30 times expected earnings. This is expensive for any stock, let alone one carrying the hopes of an entire technological revolution. Yet, unlike the dot-com era, today‚Äôs AI leaders are profitable companies with real revenue streams. Microsoft, Apple and Google aren‚Äôt cash-burning startups. They are established giants, using AI to enhance existing businesses while generating substantial profits. This makes the current situation more complicated than a simple ‚Äúbubble‚Äù comparison. The academic literature on market bubbles suggests genuine technological innovation often coincides with speculative excess. The question isn‚Äôt whether AI is transformative; it clearly is. Rather, the question is whether current valuations reflect realistic expectations about future profitability. For Australians, the AI concentration problem hits remarkably close to home through our superannuation system. Many balanced super fund options include substantial allocations to international shares, typically 20‚Äì30% of their portfolios. When your super fund buys international shares, it‚Äôs often getting heavy exposure to those same AI giants dominating US markets. The concentration risk extends beyond direct investments in tech companies. Australian mining companies, such as BHP and Fortescue, have become indirect AI players because their copper, lithium and rare earth minerals are essential for AI infrastructure. Even diversifying away from technology doesn‚Äôt fully escape AI-related risks. Research on portfolio concentration shows when major indices become dominated by a few large stocks, the benefits of diversification diminish significantly. If AI stocks experience a significant correction or crash, it could disproportionately impact Australians‚Äô retirement nest eggs. This situation represents what‚Äôs called ‚Äúsystemic concentration risk‚Äù. This is a specific form of systemic risk where supposedly diversified investments become correlated through common underlying factors or exposures. It‚Äôs reminiscent of the 2008 financial crisis, when seemingly separate housing markets across different regions all collapsed simultaneously. That was because they were all exposed to subprime mortgages with high risk of default. This does not mean anyone should panic. But regulators, super fund trustees and individual investors should all be aware of these risks. Diversification only works if returns come from a broad range of companies and industries.

Shares in the New York-based firm are expected to begin trading Friday, concluding the IPO process that first began when it filed its intentions with the SEC in June. Here‚Äôs everything you need to know about the Gemini IPO. More than 16 million shares of GEMI will be offered by the exchange in the price range of $24-26, potentially netting the firm around $433 million in IPO proceeds based on its recent upsized filing. Even at that number, which increased from a previously expected share price range of $17-19, Reuters reported that the firm‚Äôs offering was oversubscribed by as much as 20 times. Based on the upper range of the expected share price, Gemini could surpass an initial valuation of $3 billion. Though the firm is offering up 16.67 million shares, it requested that underwriters reserve 10% of the supply‚Äîor around 1.67 million shares‚Äîfor sale through a ‚Äúdirected share program,‚Äù which will offer them exclusively to select parties. Gemini is perhaps best known for its co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, early Bitcoin and cryptocurrency believers that vocally and financially supported President Donald Trump in his bid to reclaim the presidency in 2024. They also played a key role in the creation of Facebook, as chronicled in the film ‚ÄúThe Social Network.‚Äù The firm primarily generates its revenue from trading fees earned via the use of its centralized exchange. According to its IPO filing, nearly 70% of the firm‚Äôs revenue was earned in this manner during 2024. Last year, the firm generated $142.2 million in revenue, yet sustained a net income loss of $158.5 million. Through the first six months of this year, the firm‚Äôs percentage of trading fee revenue dipped to 65.5%, pulling in total revenue of $68.6 million. That puts it on track to finish just below last year‚Äôs revenue number. In the same timeframe, the firm generated a net income loss of $282.5 million. Despite the sagging income numbers, the firm remains optimistic about its future. Gemini wrote in its filing that based on its ‚Äúfocus on innovation and a long history of firsts in the crypto industry, we believe our products and services can fulfill the needs of our ever-expanding user base, including as traditional financial market participants enter the space.‚Äù Gemini‚Äôs intentions to go public came shortly after the massively successful IPO of stablecoin issuer, Circle. Like Gemini, Circle upsized its IPO and still more than tripled the offering price on the first day of trading, outperforming public launches from tech giants like Meta and Airbnb in the process. Since Circle‚Äôs IPO, crypto exchanges like Kraken and Gemini filed their intentions to go public. Crypto exchange Bullish also recently completed its IPO, similarly screaming out of the gate and tripling after hitting the market. American Bitcoin, the BTC mining firm co-founded by Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, also surged after its recent launch. On Thursday, crypto lender Figure raised more than $787 million in its IPO, ultimately notching a valuation of $5.29 billion. Shares jumped more than 24% from the IPO price once they hit the market for trading. As barriers to entry for buying and selling cryptocurrency have decreased, centralized exchanges like Gemini and rivals Coinbase and Binance have become increasingly competitive in trying to acquire and maintain users. Based on its filing, Gemini is hoping to increase both its monthly transacting users and the average daily trading volume of those users. It aims to do so via expanding its product suite, expanding internationally, and growing its derivative offerings‚Äîand a big chunk of IPO cash could help it accomplish those goals.

Meta Ray-Bans have often been very difficult to find in stock at both retailers and online stores for the past two years -- and they rarely go on sale. But one of the best ways to not only get a 20% discount but also find some of the styles that have been discontinued or are rarely ever in stock is to use the little-known Meta Refurbished AI Glasses online store. I recently ordered a pair of Meta Ray-Bans in the Skylar style with the Shiny Caramel finish with Polar Brown lenses. If you've followed Meta Ray-Bans, then you've probably seen these before because they are in a lot of the Meta promotional materials. The frames themselves are semi-transparent, so you can see a lot of the technology inside. And the lenses have that amber tint that's popular in lots of sunglasses because it gives the world a bit of warm orange glow. I was able to buy these for $263, even though they normally retail for $329. Other configurations, like the black with blue transition lenses, were as much as $76 off. As of the writing of this article, Meta's refurbished store was selling the Wayfarer, Headliner, and Skyler styles. The Wayfarer is the most common style, while the Headliner and Skyler can be more difficult to find. Also: 5 Meta Ray-Ban upgrades I want to see on September 17 When my transparent brown Meta Ray-Bans arrived, they were in the original box and it was unopened, with the perforated pull tag still in perfect condition -- no different than the box of the original pair of black Meta Ray-Bans I bought when the product first launched two years ago. When I opened the box, everything was in perfect order, just like a new pair. All the accessories, booklets, polishing cloth, and even the paper protectors over the arms of the glasses were just as they are in the packaging of a brand-new pair of Meta Ray-Bans that you'd buy at retail or online. Also: I tried Meta's new Oakley smart glasses in my production studio - my verdict as a content creator I pulled the little protective tab inside the case to activate charging and plugged the case into a USB. After about 30 minutes, I opened the Meta AI app, tapped the glasses button on the far right, hit the plus sign in the upper right corner, and tapped on the Ray-Ban | Meta button. The software immediately recognized that a pair of glasses was in a case nearby. I accepted the prompt and tapped through the menus. I pulled the glasses out of the case and examined them, and they were in perfect condition. I put them on and immediately started using them like the other pairs of Meta Ray-Bans I've been testing and using for the past couple of years. So if these are just like new and sold at a discount, then what does it mean when you buy a refurbished tech product? These are typically products that have been lightly used and a customer returned or traded in for another product, or that originally had small defects. They go back to the manufacturer for inspection, cleaning, repair (if needed), and another round of quality assurance. Also: I tried smart glasses with a built-in display, and they beat my Meta Ray-Bans in key ways They are then repacked, often in the same original packaging as new products. However, both the US and the European Union have regulations that require refurbished products to be marked and sold as refurbished, and can't be passed off as new products. That's why they are typically discounted, even though in many cases they are as good as new. In the case of refurbished Meta Ray-Bans, when you buy through the Meta Refurbished AI Glasses online store, then Meta offers a 30-day return policy and a 1-year warranty. Based on my experience, I have no problem recommending that you buy a refurbished pair of these smart glasses, if one of the styles you like is available. Keep in mind that Meta is likely to unveil its next-generation Meta Ray-Bans Smart Glasses on September 17 at its Meta Connect event. These could have new features like longer battery life and better cameras -- two of the items on my wish list. It's unclear if they will be more expensive, but it appears possible if they are integrating better technology, and there's also the uncertain US tariff situation that could impact the cost of parts. The recently released Oakley Meta Smart Glasses have some nice tech upgrades and retail for $400-$500. That could be an indication of where the prices of the new Meta Ray-Bans are going to land. If that's the case, the deal on these refurbished Meta Ray-Bans could look even better.

Preston Fore is a reporter at Fortune, covering education and personal finance for the Success team. 2025 might just be the year of Oracle. The 48-year-old tech company‚Äôs stock value has doubled year-to-date, and just in the last week, soared by over 30% off the heels of a bullish earnings report. Oracle‚Äôs market cap is now valued over $920 billion‚Äîhigher than that of Walmart and JPMorgan Chase. This substantial stock performance has boosted the wealth of Oracle‚Äôs investors, namely Larry Ellison. As the company‚Äôs founder, chairman, and chief technology officer, his wealth has grown to over $350 billion, putting him neck-and-neck with Elon Musk as the world‚Äôs richest person. But it‚Äôs not just Ellison who‚Äôs been owed all the credit‚Äîor the award. Oracle‚Äôs CEO Safra Catz has been at the helm of the company for over a decade, and her wealth jumped by over $400 million in just six hours on Wednesday to $3.4 billion, according to Forbes. ‚ÄúClearly, we had an amazing start to the year because Oracle has become the go-to place for AI workloads,‚Äù Catz said during Tuesday‚Äôs earnings call. ‚ÄúWe have signed significant cloud contracts with the who‚Äôs who of AI, including OpenAI, xAI, Meta, Nvidia, AMD and many others.‚Äù Catz‚Äôs leadership successes at Oracle have cemented her as one of the richest self-made women in the world, having climbed the ladder first on Wall Street as an investment banker before heading to Silicon Valley to join Oracle (the tech firm later moved to Austin in 2020). And part of what has helped drive the tech company to succeed is her mantra to always be the best. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to follow others. We always try to do something differently,‚Äù she told CNBC earlier this year. ‚ÄúBeing No. 1 is very, very important. It also means you‚Äôre the best and solving customers‚Äô needs. On the surface level, Oracle‚Äôs recent stock success is somewhat head-scratching. The company has been around for over four decades, and other big-name tech companies, such as IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon, have made the cloud services market more crowded than ever. Moreover, during Tuesday‚Äôs earnings report, Oracle announced it actually had slightly missed earnings and revenue projections. However, investors have been more impressed with what Oracle has coming down the pipeline, namely its plan to 14x its cloud infrastructure revenue. By fiscal year 2030, its cloud infrastructure revenue will be $144 billion‚Äîup from fiscal year 2025‚Äôs $10.3 billion. Just this week, OpenAI signed a $300 billion cloud contract with Oracle for the construction of data centers over the next five years, according to The New York Times. As the roughly 41% stakeholder in Oracle, Ellison has reaped the greatest benefits from his tech company‚Äôs 450% share price growth over the last five years. The 81-year-old also has gained substantial wealth from previous involvement in Tesla, as well as now owning close to 50% in Paramount Skydance. Catz too owes her billionaire status to Oracle. Although her base salary is $950,000, the majority of her wealth is connected to the market. She maintains about 1.1 million in shares but regularly receives and exercises stock options; earlier this year, she sold stock options worth some $1.8 billion, according to Bloomberg. Fortune reached out to Oracle for comment. Catz is a double graduate from the University of Pennsylvania, having gone to law school shortly after graduating with a business-focused bachelor‚Äôs degree. And even though she ultimately decided to forgo a career in law, she has no regrets. ‚ÄúMy best decision was to choose to go to Wall Street over law. I learned a lot and focused on the expanding software industry at a time when the independent software industry was just beginning,‚Äù she told Time in 2010. ‚ÄúThat ultimately brought me to Oracle.‚Äù And as a leader, one of her core principles is always keeping an open mind. ‚ÄúListen, think and don‚Äôt be afraid to change your position based on new facts,‚Äù she told Fortune in 2015 after being asked the biggest leadership lesson she‚Äôd learned over the past year. The then-newly minted co-CEO of Oracle added that employees deserve to be heard out in every meeting. ‚ÄúIf something doesn‚Äôt make sense, give them the respect of asking tough questions,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThink about what you‚Äôve been told because if it doesn‚Äôt make sense to you, then it may not make sense at all.

Title: Oracle CEO Larry Ellison‚Äôs ability to secure Nvidia GPUs has made it the cloud contender it never was and allowed Ellison to briefly surpass Elon Musk as the world‚Äôs richest man

Jeremy Kahn is the AI editor at Fortune, spearheading the publication's coverage of artificial intelligence. He also co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune‚Äôs flagship AI newsletter. Good morning. It‚Äôs Jeremy here, filling in for Andrew, who is now on paternity leave for a bit. So you‚Äôll see a rotating cast of Fortune tech journalists writing this newsletter for a few weeks. Fortune Brainstorm Tech wrapped yesterday. Here were a few highlights from the final day of the conference: Meanwhile, the tech world is talking about Oracle‚Äôs massive market gains, which have boosted Oracle founder, chairman, and chief technology officer Larry Ellison‚Äôs net worth, allowing him to surpass Elon Musk to claim the title of world‚Äôs richest man. Helping to drive Oracle‚Äôs stock was the announcement of a massive $300 billion deal with OpenAI to supply the AI company with data center capacity. (Now we know why OpenAI is telling investors it‚Äôs going to burn through $115 billion in cash by 2029.) Of course, the only reason Oracle is in this position is down to Ellison‚Äôs courting of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, which has allowed his company, previously a distinct back-of-the-pack cloud company, to secure a massive stockpile of top-of-the-line Nvidia GPUs. More on Ellison‚Äôs soaring fortunes below. Buy-now, pay-later fintech Klarna‚Äôs IPO went off, with the company‚Äôs shares gaining 15% on opening day. (Whether that ‚Äúopening day pop‚Äù is a good thing is a debate for another day. It seems like the finance profs have mostly lost the argument, with bankers convincing companies that the money lost from underpricing the shares is worth its weight in marketing and investor buzz from the opening day jump.) Beatrice Nolan has more too on Sam Altman‚Äôs sit down with conservative broadcaster Tucker Carlson. While Altman said a number of interesting things‚Äîmost of which he has said before‚Äîthe real news was the fact that Atlman felt the need to do Carlson‚Äôs podcast in the first place. Clearly OpenAI has seen reports that the MAGA crowd is unhappy with President Donald Trump‚Äôs cozy relationship with Silicon Valley‚Äôs biggest players and is hoping to win them over. The MAGA wing of the Republican Party views AI companies with at best skepticism and at worst, downright disdain, seeing them as woke bastions of left wing coastal elitism, exemplars of Silicon Valley‚Äôs inordinate, insidious, and arbitrary power, and, in their quest to build AGI and ‚Äúsuperintelligence,‚Äù guilty of a kind of idolatry (essentially trying to build God in a machine). You can watch Carlson press Altman on these points throughout the podcast, while Altman tries, often awkwardly, to parry the premise of Carlson‚Äôs questions, or assure Carlson that there‚Äôs really not as much ideological distance between them as Carlson seems to assume. It‚Äôs all slightly cringey (especially Carlson‚Äôs over-the-top facial expressions). But, despite the cringe factor, it is probably worth watching, if only to get a deeper sense of the reasons MAGA distrusts Silicon Valley in general and AI in particular. Ok, now here‚Äôs more tech news. ‚ÄîJeremy Kahn Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Fortune Tech? Drop a line here. Oracle‚Äôs revenue projections sent the stock, and Ellison‚Äôs net worth, soaring on Wednesday. It was bad news for old friend Elon Musk, though, whose nearly year-long reign as the world‚Äôs richest man came to a brief end. (Oracle stock pulled back a bit before the close, allowing Musk to regain the title.) Oracle‚Äôs strong quarterly results added a whopping $101 billion to Ellison‚Äôs wealth at one point, boosting his fortune to $393 billion and leapfrogging above Musk‚Äôs $385 billion, according to Bloomberg‚Äôs Billionaires Index. The staggering increase was the largest one-day increase ever recorded by the index. Oracle stock surged 36% on Wednesday‚Äîthe company‚Äôs biggest one-day increase ever‚Äîafter executives reported blowout bookings and gave a bullish cloud outlook. The rally adds to the 45% gain the company already notched up this year. The Wall Street Journal reported that the majority of the new revenue will come from OpenAI, which signed a staggering $300B cloud agreement with Oracle. The AI firm will tap Oracle‚Äôs computing infrastructure under the billion dollar deal, which is one of the largest cloud contracts ever signed. The commitment far exceeds OpenAI‚Äôs current revenue. Oracle‚Äôs revenue projections shocked analysts, who told CNBC they were ‚Äúblown away‚Äù and ‚Äúall kind of in shock.‚Äù Some, however, are urging caution, warning the unprecedented success has made the stock overvalued. ‚ÄîBeatrice Nolan The pair also discussed OpenAI cofounder Elon Musk, with Altman saying he now ‚Äúfeels differently‚Äù about the man he once saw as an ‚Äúincredible hero.‚Äù Perhaps it's because of the lawsuits, or the X spats. In one tense moment, when the pair discussed OpenAI whistleblower Suchir Balaji‚Äôs death, Altman asked if Carlson was accusing him of murder after the podcast host declared the death, which authorities have ruled as a suicide, ‚Äúdefinitely murder.‚Äù "I haven't done too many interviews where I have been accused of murder,‚Äù Altman said. ‚ÄîBeatrice Nolan Microsoft is cracking down on its hybrid work policy. The tech giant is mandating a minimum of three in-office days a week for employees beginning February 2026, according to a Business Insider report. The policy will first apply to Seattle-area staff, later expanding nationwide and globally. Workers have until Sept. 19 to request exceptions. Microsoft rolled out a flexible work policy after offices reopened from pandemic closures where employees were permitted to work from home up to half the time without official approval. This move follows similar steps from Big Tech rivals including Meta and Google, which already enforce similar RTO rules. The stricter approach comes as the company increases pressure on employees, reshaping performance expectations in an effort to prepare for the next phase of AI-driven growth. Staff in Microsoft‚Äôs AI division, led by DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman, will face an even stricter requirement: four days a week on site starting January 2026, with exceptions only granted at the highest levels. ‚ÄîBeatrice Nolan Klarna climbed 15% in its Wednesday trading debut. The Swedish-born fintech shares closed at $45.82, 15% above the $40 offer price. CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski framed the listing as proof Klarna is moving beyond buy-now, pay-later into broader banking products, even if the company‚Äôs value has dropped well below its 2021 peak. The closing price values the company at over $17 billion based on its outstanding shares, with stock options and warrants adding slightly to that figure. The company‚Äôs debut also made dozens of staffers millionaires, and its cofounders billionaires. The listing arrives amid a resurgence in the IPO market, which has been under pressure, with companies including Figma debuting with strong performances. Klarna‚Äôs debut didn‚Äôt quite make the same splash as Figma‚Äôs in July, which saw the stock more than triple from its offer price. ‚ÄîBeatrice Nolan ‚ÄîMeta and TikTok score a win against EU tech fees. But won‚Äôt receive any money back while officials reformulate the levy. ‚ÄîApple‚Äôs new AI guidelines are Trump-friendly. The company marked DEI as a ‚Äúcontroversial‚Äù topic. ‚ÄîReddit removes subscriber counts from subreddits. The platform will switch to displaying weekly active visitors. ‚ÄîAmazon-owned Zoox launches public service in Las Vegas. It‚Äôs limited to pick-ups and drop-offs at a select number of pre-approved locations. ¬© 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: How The 10 Richest American Hedge Fund Managers Got $20 Billion Richer In A Year

ByHank Tucker, Forbes Staff. Most hedge funds have lagged behind the AI-fueled stock market surge of the past three years, opting for lower-risk investments. But that hasn‚Äôt stopped investor money from clamoring to get access to the top firms‚Äîor investment gains and carried interest from adding billions to their billionaire owners‚Äô pockets. The 10 richest hedge fund managers on this year‚Äôs Forbes 400 ranking of the country‚Äôs richest people are worth a combined $174 billion, up $20 billion from a year ago. Citadel‚Äôs Ken Griffin was the biggest gainer by far, with his fortune swelling by more than $7 billion to an estimated $50.4 billion, widening Griffin‚Äôs lead over the rest of the pack. The next three richest hedge fund managers in the U.S.‚ÄîDavid Tepper of Appaloosa Management, Steve Cohen of Point72 and Israel Englander of Millennium Management‚Äîonly added about $3 billion to their fortunes on average over the same span. Each of these four investors generated double-digit net returns in 2024, outperforming the 6.2% return of the HFRI 500 Fund Weighted Composite Index, which tracks the largest hedge funds that are open to new investments. That hedge fund index‚Äôs three-year average annual return through the first half of 2025 is a meager 4.6%, trounced by the S&P 500‚Äôs annualized return of 16% over that same period. Against that lackluster competition, the best of the best can charge higher fees without driving their investors away. Citadel, Millennium, Point72 and others all have implemented or expanded so-called passthrough fee arrangements in recent years that have shifted more operating costs to investors, beyond the standard 2% management fee that has long been a hedge fund staple. The top firms have staffs of several thousand employees who are expensive but have proven worthwhile. The annualized return for Citadel‚Äôs flagship Wellington fund from 1990 through 2024 is 19.5%, after fees. Millennium‚Äôs net annualized return since inception in 1989, meanwhile, is 14%, with only one down year, in 2008. Most of these top firms are largely closed to new investors, and habitually return profits to existing limited partners, in order to stay lean enough to sustain their performance. But they‚Äôve spawned plenty of imitators, with Hedge Fund Research reporting that net inflows into hedge funds in the second quarter this year amounted to $25 billion, representing the highest quarterly net asset inflow in 11 years. Still, the gap between the upstarts and the most technologically advanced multistrategy firms is widening. Citadel, D.E. Shaw and Millennium generated $29.5 billion in net gains in 2024, according to LCH Investments, amounting to more than 10% of the net $289 billion in gains all hedge fund managers produced. The founders of these firms have long been mainstays on The Forbes 400. Citadel has become the envy of the hedge fund world, managing $68 billion in assets, but an even larger piece of Griffin‚Äôs net worth comes from his majority ownership stake in Citadel Securities, a separate market-making firm that booked $9.7 billion in net trading revenue last year. He used some of the profits to add to his collection of homes and toys, spending $45 million on fellow Forbes 400 member Julia Koch‚Äôs Park Avenue co-op this February and $18 million on rare copies of the Emancipation Proclamation and 13th Amendment signed by Abraham Lincoln. He intends to loan those documents for public display ahead of the United States‚Äô 250th birthday festivities next year. Tepper‚Äôs personal capital makes up the majority of Appaloosa‚Äôs $17 billion in assets under management. The largest position in the fund‚Äôs stock portfolio as of the end of June was an $800 million stake in Chinese tech giant Alibaba, and Tepper made a significant investment in the second quarter into UnitedHealth Group, taking advantage of a steep decline in the company‚Äôs stock price. His portfolio also includes ‚ÄúMagnificent Seven‚Äù stocks Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, Microsoft and Alphabet. Point72 has rapidly grown in size since it opened to outside capital in 2018 and now manages $40 billion in its multi-strategy funds. The firm generated $5 billion in net gains in 2024, according to LCH Investments, with its main fund returning a reported 19%. Cohen has used some of his earnings to try to make his beloved New York Mets a World Series contender, buying the MLB team for $2.4 billion in 2020 and committing a 15-year, $765 million contract to poach superstar slugger Juan Soto from the crosstown Yankees last winter. Millennium manages $78 billion and is reportedly looking to sell a minority stake in its business at a valuation of $14 billion. Selling general partnership stakes to firms like Blue Owl or Petershill Partners has become common for elite private equity firms over the past decade, and several private equity giants are also publicly traded. Investors have generally shied away from owning pieces of hedge funds on the other hand, due to the more volatile nature of the business, but with some funds producing steady returns and locking up assets for longer periods of time, Millennium could be starting a trend. Dalio sold off his ownership stake in Bridgewater and resigned from its board this year, half a century after he founded the firm in 1975, though he reportedly remains invested in its funds. Bridgewater‚Äôs assets under management have declined to $92 billion, from a high of $168 billion in 2019, during a period marked by middling performance and a prolonged leadership transition. Its flagship Pure Alpha fund rebounded with an 11.3% gain in 2024, its best year since 2018, and gained another 17% in the first half of this year. Ackman‚Äôs ambitious plans to launch a closed-end fund for U.S. investors with as much as $25 billion in new assets ended in failure when he scrapped its IPO in July 2024, but his existing $20 billion portfolio has continued to perform well. Its net return was 10.2% in 2024, fueled by stocks like Alphabet, Chipotle and Brookfield. Ackman started buying Uber stock earlier this year; the company‚Äôs shares were his largest position as of the end of June, worth $2.8 billion. He is also hoping to transform real estate developer Howard Hughes Holdings into a diversified holding company emulating Warren Buffett‚Äôs Berkshire Hathaway. Kovner left Caxton in 2011, handing the reins to his successor Andrew Law, after founding and running the firm for 28 years. Kovner now manages his portfolio through his family office CAM Capital and has invested in several life sciences and biotech startups in recent years, including Kriya Therapeutics, which develops gene therapies to treat chronic diseases, and Palvella Therapeutics, which is focused on treating genetic skin diseases. Shaw stepped back from day-to-day management of D.E. Shaw in 2001, leaving it in the hands of a seven-person executive committee that today manages $70 billion. But Shaw remains the firm‚Äôs principal owner, according to its SEC filings. D.E. Shaw‚Äôs flagship Composite and Oculus funds gained 18% and 36% in 2024, respectively, helping the firm produce $11.1 billion in gains, more than any other hedge fund according to LCH Investments. Tudor Investment Corp., which manages $17 billion in assets, gained a modest 6.5% last year, and its macro-focused founder is cautioning investors about what he views as an overheated stock market and the underlying dangers of artificial intelligence. In an op-ed he wrote for Time in June, Jones cited the rising unemployment rate for recent college graduates and said, ‚ÄúAs someone who has spent nearly half a century as a professional risk manager, every alarm bell in my being is ringing.‚Äù Two Sigma‚Äôs two founders have a strained relationship that boiled into the open when a 2023 SEC filing disclosed that they were ‚Äúunable to reach agreement on a number of topics.‚Äù But the quant hedge fund is still a powerhouse with $60 billion in assets under management. Overdeck and Siegel stepped back from their co-CEO roles last year to become co-chairmen of the firm, but Overdeck returned to its management committee earlier this year.

Title: Google TPUs Vs Nvidia GPUs

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Google has begun placing its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) in data centres run by smaller cloud providers that have long relied on Nvidia's GPUs. This is more than a product rollout‚Äîit's a calculated move in the AI infrastructure chess game. The effects extend across the AI ecosystem, creating both opportunity and uncertainty for investors. While individual AI names like Google and Nvidia could see heightened volatility as the landscape shifts, those seeking exposure with less single-stock risk might prefer diversified approaches. The High Quality Portfolio, for example, has comfortably outperformed its blended benchmark‚Äîa mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes‚Äîand has delivered returns exceeding 91% since inception, letting investors participate in these structural shifts across multiple quality companies instead of betting on a single winner. Separately, see ‚Äì How Oracle Stock Surges 3x To $900? TPUs are Google's purpose-built AI chips designed specifically for machine-learning tasks. While Nvidia's GPUs are versatile general-purpose processors, TPUs act like specialized scalpels optimized for AI workloads. The latest Ironwood chip delivers 42.5 exaflops of compute per pod with more than 9,200 chips per unit‚Äî‚Äúmore than 10x improvement‚Äù over Google's previous generation. Also, take a look at ‚Äì How Does Google Stock Rise 2x? This puts Nvidia in an uncomfortable spot: Still, Nvidia enjoys a massive ecosystem and deep relationships. The key question: Can Google win meaningful share before Nvidia responds? This is not just about chips‚Äîit‚Äôs about control of the AI infrastructure stack. Google is effectively telling the market, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need Nvidia‚Äôs ecosystem anymore.‚Äù Yet in reducing dependence on Nvidia, customers may increase dependence on Google‚Äôs technology. For buyers, the trade-off is clear: would you rather be locked into Nvidia or Google? Separately, look at ‚Äì Are Nvidia Investors Ignoring This Big Risk? Google‚Äôs custom TPU push is a bid to challenge Nvidia‚Äôs dominance. But this isn‚Äôt a simple one-on-one duel. With companies like Broadcom, AMD, and Marvell advancing their own chips, AI hardware is now a multi-player race. That‚Äôs good for the industry‚Äîmore competition, more choice, and potentially lower costs. For investors, it signals a heating AI infrastructure market with no guaranteed single winner. Nvidia isn‚Äôt finished, but the competition is tougher than ever. While the AI arms race intensifies, you could explore the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000) to deliver strong returns. Why? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to benefit from upbeat markets while limiting losses when conditions turned, as shown in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Most marketers think we‚Äôll rely on AI to produce most creative content by 2030

Advertisement September 11, 2025 | 9 min read Listen to article 4 min It‚Äôs just one finding from a new WPP report on senior marketers‚Äô visions for advertising‚Äôs near future. We sit down with the author. What will advertising, media and our consumer lives look like in 2030? A new report asks experts. / Drmakete Lab Via Unsplash Decide for yourself how alarmed you are by a future where most ‚Äòcreative content‚Äô (including art, music, TV shows and movies) is created by AI. But according to the 2025 edition of WPP Media‚Äôs Advertising in 2030 report, most marketers think that reality will already be with us in five years‚Äô time. A follow-up to similar reports in 2020 and 2021, the research digs into the credence that top marketers and analysts give to certain possible near-future scenarios. The portion of respondents predicting this AI-dominated media future (now at 71%) was the greatest ‚Äòpositive‚Äô shift in sentiment since the last edition of the report, reflecting the dizzying pace of AI-related change marketers are seeing right now. One expert interviewed for the research, attention primo Karen Nelson Field, said: ‚ÄúThe rate of transformation in only two years since AI became accessible is astounding. Nothing will be the same across the entire advertising ecosystem in 2030.‚Äù Plenty of the study‚Äôs respondents argue that 2030 is too soon a date to predict such a major shift, or that AI is more likely to dominate advertising content than narrative entertainment, or that AI will play only a partial role. But the portion treating the scenario seriously is striking. Other formerly science-fictional scenarios viewed as likely by the study‚Äôs cohort include a 2030 where most interactions between brands and consumers are ‚Äòbot-to-bot,‚Äô with individuals‚Äô personal assistants liaising directly with customer service bots. Citing efficiency, convenience and the rapidly developing sophistication of ‚Äòagentic AI,‚Äô 66% of respondents viewed the scenario as likely ‚Äì although most (61%) don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll yet have passed the tipping point at which most social media ‚Äòusers‚Äô are fictitious personae. Nor do they say, on balance, that they‚Äôre expecting the efficiencies associated with automation will result in reduced working hours or wages, with 66% rejecting that scenario ‚Äì despite conceding ‚Äúdownward pressure on wages in some sectors.‚Äù But how likely is it, really, that an industry so totally overhauled by scaled AI‚Äôs promises of efficiencies and cost-savings won‚Äôt see those efficiencies reflected in billable hours and headcounts? The report‚Äôs lead author, WPP Media‚Äôs global president of business intelligence Kate Scott-Dawkins, tells The Drum that there‚Äôs evidence in that sentiment of ‚Äúa desire to be optimistic about these things in the face of so much change,‚Äù but that there may also be some reason for that optimism. ‚ÄúOur industry is already one of the most integrated with AI and, if you look at job numbers now in the ad industry versus 10 years ago when we first started seeing Google and Meta applying machine learning and natural language processing and all these optimization programs, we‚Äôre not dramatically worse off‚Ä¶ So there‚Äôs some rationale for people thinking it‚Äôll just look different. We won‚Äôt be doing the same things, but our industry has continued to grow and we‚Äôll just be doing new things with the help of AI. We may lose some jobs and types of jobs, but I can understand why they are optimistic about the industry as a whole.‚Äù (That optimism should perhaps be tempered with the trajectory of employment figures across the industry since the AI revolution began in earnest: in toto, adland‚Äôs big five holding companies reduced their workforce by over 2% last year; WPP itself has suffered a 5% drop in headcount over the last year.) Advertisement Hovering above the AI of it all, Scott-Dawkins says there‚Äôs greater reason to be cheerful to be gleaned from the difference between this year‚Äôs report and its Covid-era predecessors. The original report set out to answer, first, a provocative question: will advertising even continue to exist in 10 years‚Äô time? Those Covid years, she says, were a time of soul-searching and a time where the growing adoption of adblockers, all-subs-no-ads media channels like Netflix, behove the industry to ask itself existential questions. Taking stock of where the industry as a whole finds itself in 2025 shows that question has almost entirely receded from view: Netflix is now, per a headline in these pages, ‚ÄòAll-in on ads‚Äô; in 2024, the global ad business saw revenues of over $1tn for the first time in history. If anything, Scott-Dawkins says, in 2025 we see an industry hungrier than ever to expand its coverage. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen a noticeable shift in the number and types of companies that are selling advertising now, with this realization that it can be a useful revenue stream, especially in low-margin businesses like retail. And now we‚Äôre getting into all the different places where you can have screens and consumer interaction‚Äù ‚Äì with growth expected not just in retail media, but transit, transport, wearables‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúYou can picture this world where we‚Äôre able to turn any sort of surface and glass into content. That‚Äôs an interesting counterpoint to where we were five years ago.‚Äù Other stark shifts from where we were five years ago: the metaverse, cause celebre of the industry until the AI hype cycle engulfed all the space around it, has fallen away almost entirely, taking with it predictions about growth in uses of virtual and augmented reality tech (though, Scott-Dawkins says, the experts weren‚Äôt that convinced back in 2020 either ‚Äì ‚Äúthey‚Äôre as pessimistic now as they were then‚Äù). Scott-Dawkins goes on: ‚ÄúWhat they got wrong was the sustainability piece.‚Äù In what the report calls a ‚Äústriking reversal,‚Äù predictions that the environmental impact of goods and services would be more important to us than price by 2030 swung radically. In 2020, 70% thought that was likely. Now, 74% say it‚Äôs unlikely. Acknowledging a ‚Äúcultural realignment‚Äù and ‚Äúgreenwashing fears‚Äù on the corporate side, the report declares that ‚Äúconsumers and marketers both seem to be moving on.‚Äù Advertisement In the data and privacy worlds, the report finds a balance of experts predicting by 2030 the widespread use of biometric data to access and personalize services; the widespread personalization of goods and services; and the widespread accessibility of personal data by corporations and governments. But they reject as unlikely the development of single, global approaches. In tech and media, most experts rejected as unlikely a scenario where 3D printing would replace mass production. They also rejected a scenario in which ‚Äúseamless micropayments‚Äù replace subscription and ad models for online publishers, and one in which most products and services would be bought as part of a subscription. They mostly agreed that the same internet service providers, platforms and social media companies would remain intact until 2030, despite ongoing antitrust actions. For publishers, they predict more change, with 63% seeing it as likely that most news consumption would come from individual creators, ‚Äòcitizen journalists‚Äô and bots. As the next decade approaches, what‚Äôs most striking, says Scott-Dawkins, is that ‚Äúpeople got more pessimistic across the board‚Äù ‚Äì less likely, that is, to predict changes to the status quo. Will the study run again before 2030? Maybe ‚Äì but maybe the AI question will by then have become even more all-pervasive. ‚ÄúMaybe, I don‚Äôt know, we‚Äôll be asking AI about itself.‚Äù Catch up on the most important stories of the day, curated by our editorial team.

Title: Oracle CEO Safra Catz's net worth rises $412 million in a day as stock hits record highs

Oracle Corp.‚Äôs stock rally this week has not only lifted the software giant‚Äôs market value but also added significantly to the personal wealth of its chief executive officer, Safra Catz. According to CNBC, Catz‚Äôs net worth surged by about $412 million during the first six hours of trading on Wednesday after the company‚Äôs strong earnings report sent its shares up nearly 40%. Forbes estimates her net worth at $3.4 billion as of Wednesday afternoon, compared with $3 billion earlier in the day. The jump followed Oracle‚Äôs disclosure of $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, contracted revenue that has yet to be recognised. The figures underline the company‚Äôs accelerating growth in cloud services and its expanding role in powering artificial intelligence workloads. Larry Ellison, Oracle‚Äôs co-founder, benefited even more from the rally. His net worth soared to an estimated $386.3 billion, making him the world‚Äôs second-richest person, up from $293 billion at the start of the trading day. ‚ÄúOracle has become the go-to place for AI workloads,‚Äù Catz said on the company‚Äôs earnings call, citing new cloud contracts with firms such as OpenAI, xAI, Meta, Nvidia and AMD. Catz, who has been Oracle‚Äôs sole CEO since 2019, has overseen a more than 800% rise in the company‚Äôs stock price during her tenure. She previously led Oracle‚Äôs M&A strategy, completing high-profile acquisitions including PeopleSoft and Sun Microsystems. Analysts across Wall Street were surprised by the scale of Oracle‚Äôs performance. Deutsche Bank‚Äôs Brad Zelnick said he was ‚Äúin shock, in a very good way,‚Äù while John DiFucci of Guggenheim Securities said he was ‚Äúblown away.‚Äù Bank of America analysts have forecast further upside in the stock on the back of Oracle‚Äôs strong revenue pipeline and AI-driven demand. Oracle's shares were already on the rise before the latest financial results. They increased by 45% this year through Tuesday‚Äôs close, four times the gain seen in the S&P 500. Its surge on Wednesday also boosted other AI stocks, including Nvidia, which rose 3.8%. In Asia, Nvidia suppliers rallied in Japan and South Korea, with Advantest Corp. up over 3% and SK Hynix Inc. increasing by 5.6%. The company's forecast underscores the need for global AI developers to step up their investments. OpenAI, an Oracle customer, predicts it will need trillions of dollars over time to invest in the infrastructure needed to develop and run its services. Major US companies have recently given investors grounds for optimism about the pace and sustainability of AI investment. Last week, Broadcom Inc. announced it had secured a major new customer in this sector. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: Remaining CAPEX Obligation
URL: https://platformonomics.com/2025/09/remaining-capex-obligation/
Time Published: 2025-09-10T23:48:10Z
Full Content:
Read By Rather than further update the last post, we‚Äôll start anew. In our preparation for this week‚Äôs Oracle earnings, we wrote: Absolute bestest most glorious company ever in entire universe of all time prepare awesome-sauce victory lap. With tomorrow‚Äôs earnings announcement the database vampire will permit us to bask in their greatness and invite us to contemplate why other companies even exist. Things are always so fabulous that the Oxford English Dictionary is considering replacing the word ‚Äúsuperlative‚Äù with ‚ÄúOracle‚Äù. Despite a mediocre quarter, Oracle stock price took that awesome-sauce victory lap (and then some). Oracle missed revenue and earnings expectations, reported slower growth than each of the much larger Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft, free cash flow went further negative, and CAPEX shrank to $8.5 billion from the previous quarter‚Äôs $9.2 billion. But it was a ‚Äúbombastically scripted earnings call‚Äù for the ages. Oracle stock was up 36% today, maybe an all-time one day increase in valuation record. Kudos to Oracle for giving the market what it wanted to hear and to Larry for becoming the world‚Äôs richest man (doubtlessly a long coveted title). The stock rocketed based on Oracle announcing a $317 billion increase in their Remaining Performance Obligation (RPO), which is a non-GAAP metric of booked but not yet delivered revenue (SEC reported Deferred Revenue, which is the stricter portion of RPO, was $12.1 billion, up 29% from the previous quarter). My argument remains that Oracle is hyping future cloud revenue (that may or may not materialize), but neglecting the costs required to deliver and book that revenue. The iron law of cloud computing is no infrastructure, no revenue. And Oracle is a relative financial pipsqueak whose capital allocation abilities are already stressed. This post offers guidance for people furiously updating their Excel models that detail every parameter of Oracle‚Äôs next half-decade. A day after the earnings call focused on that $317 billion increase in RPO, we learned Open AI was responsible for $300 billion of that increase (how much that actually translates into SEC reported Deferred Revenue is a question for next quarter). Oracle stock is now a one-way bet on whether Open AI can raise hundreds of billions in new capital. Stargate ‚Äúhas struggled to get out of the gate‚Äù and Open AI is passing the hat for single digit billions instead of the desired trillions. Open AI‚Äôs projected losses are growing. Oracle tried to paint the RPO explosion as broad based, citing xAI, Meta, NVIDIA and AMD as new customers. xAi has no revenue, is itself struggling to raise money, and not many customers are going to be dumb enough to take a business dependency on Elon for AI. Meta is in the midst of a $600 billion AI mulligan (maybe ‚Äì neither Zuck nor the CFO are sure actually how much they plan to spend). But Meta likely promised every well-compensated recent hire their own GPU clusters, and Oracle is a source. NVIDIA and AMD are merely recycling revenue from Oracle (but the SEC, like Congress, is on recess). And why don‚Äôt they talk about their biggest current customer? (ByteDance). If you are adding the new RPO numbers to your Oracle models, you also have to add the infrastructure costs, aka the Remaining CAPEX Obligation. Again, no infrastructure, no revenue. Let‚Äôs return to the AWS history, as it is a great proxy, but step through it in more detail than the last post. We have ten years of data that lets us directly compare annual CAPEX to revenue. We see AWS-specific CAPEX as a percentage of annual AWS revenue dropping from 60%, bottoming at 27% in 2023, and ramping back above 50% as the AI frenzy hits (they‚Äôre above 70% for the first half of 2025). Now lets look at same numbers for Oracle: You quickly notice Oracle is far less efficient than AWS, with CAPEX/revenue ratios in the triple digits ranging between 100% and 208% (the FY26 numbers are Oracle‚Äôs revenue and CAPEX guidance for the current fiscal year). This is consistent with Oracle being a noob when it comes to large scale data centers, as we have chronicled. But it also shows the absurdity of Oracle‚Äôs claims to be ‚Äúasset pretty light‚Äù ‚Äì they are vastly less efficient than AWS despite bragging about not owning data centers (‚ÄúI know some of our competitors like to own buildings‚Äù). Despite giving up margin, Oracle is not even remotely seeing any advantage from not owning data centers (I guess it could always be worse). Type your email‚Ä¶ Subscribe Now, as you update your five-year model for Oracle, you have to decide what CAPEX numbers go with that nearly geometric sequence of revenue increases. Some things to keep in mind as you pick parameters: So let‚Äôs throw out some numbers for the required CAPEX spend as a percentage of revenue (Oracle‚Äôs average over the last three years is 170%, which would be a level of CAPEX that exceeds all the new-found RPO). Pick your preferred numbers and enter them into your model: The last step for your updated model is to figure out where the money to pay for RCO is coming from. We detailed Oracle‚Äôs financial constraints in the previous post. Free cash flow is already negative. Oracle carries a fair amount of debt (though that debt/equity ratio looks better today!). And they allocate a lot of capital to Larry through both dividends and buybacks. What does Oracle‚Äôs capital allocation look like for the next five years that is consistent with your model?

September 10, 2025 19:06 ET | Source: TradeInvestNow.com TradeInvestNow.com New York, NY, Sept. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The team at Tradeinvestnow.com invites you to join Professor Joel Litman and Whitney Tilson at the "Breakout 2025" livestream event on Wednesday, September 17 at 8 p.m. ET, where these two financial experts will collaborate to discuss a stock market anomaly they've identified and demonstrate the Altimetry Doubles Scanner, a tool designed to help investors analyze stocks for potential growth opportunities. Joel Litman's Breakout 2025 event - Get all the details here Joel Litman's Breakout 2025 Event Overview The Breakout 2025 event will focus on a stock market anomaly identified by Joel Litman through a comprehensive study of over 3,000 stocks since 1994. This anomaly has appeared in companies across various sectors, including technology, retail, and energy, and is linked to significant price movements observed in recent market trends. The livestream will provide detailed information on how this anomaly functions and its relevance to the upcoming earnings season, which may influence stock price dynamics. Attendees will gain free access to the Altimetry Doubles Scanner, a tool developed by Litman to analyze over 5,000 stock tickers and assess their market potential based on his proprietary methodology. The event will also include a special report, Two Stocks to Plug into the Doubles Scanner Right Now, which examines two widely held stocks and their market outlooks. A guest speaker, a 50-year Wall Street veteran who has worked with figures like George Soros and Steve Cohen, will share additional insights on navigating current market conditions. The event aims to provide retail investors with analytical tools and perspectives typically reserved for institutional clients, fostering informed decision-making in a complex market environment. Breakout Profits: The Research Behind the Anomaly Joel Litman‚Äôs anomaly is based on a historical study analyzing stocks across multiple decades and industries. The research identified a recurring pattern in companies such as Nvidia, Lululemon, Southern Copper, Celsius, Hub Group, and Domino‚Äôs Pizza, as well as all seven of the ‚ÄúMagnificent Seven‚Äù stocks‚ÄîApple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla‚Äîprior to significant price movements. The study suggests that this anomaly is relevant to current market conditions, particularly as the earnings season approaches. The Altimetry Doubles Scanner utilizes this research to enable users to input stock tickers and receive immediate feedback on their market potential. The tool is designed to be accessible to investors of all experience levels, simplifying complex financial analysis and providing data-driven insights. Meet the Experts Joel Litman: Forensic Accounting Specialist Professor Joel Litman has nearly three decades of experience in financial analysis, having worked with firms such as Deloitte, Credit Suisse, and PricewaterhouseCoopers. Concerned by discrepancies in corporate financial reporting, he developed a proprietary valuation system to assess the true financial health of companies. His work includes predicting the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 COVID market crash, as well as identifying companies at risk of significant declines. Litman provides research to over half of the world‚Äôs 300 largest money managers. He has lectured at Harvard, MIT, Wharton, and the Pentagon, and advised the FBI and U.S. Marine Corps War College. His focus is on transparency in financial reporting to equip investors with accurate data for decision-making. Whitney Tilson: Experienced Investor Whitney Tilson, known as ‚ÄúThe Prophet‚Äù by CNBC, managed a hedge fund that grew from $1 million to over $200 million in assets over two decades. He has predicted the dot-com crash, the 2008 housing crisis, and the 2020 COVID market rebound, with appearances on 60 Minutes, CNBC, and Bloomberg. His 2015 60 Minutes investigation into Lumber Liquidators highlighted issues in corporate practices and impacted its market performance. A long-time follower of Warren Buffett, Tilson has attended 26 consecutive Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meetings and co-authored a book on Charlie Munger. His approach emphasizes identifying market opportunities and understanding broader economic trends. Breakout 2025 Event Details and Participation The Breakout 2025 event will be held on September 17, 2025, at 8 p.m. Eastern Time via livestream. To participate, individuals can reserve their spot by submitting their email address, which provides access to event updates, the Altimetry Doubles Scanner, and the special report. Attendees are encouraged to: The event is free to attend! Significance of the Breakout 2025 Event The Breakout 2025 event offers retail investors access to advanced financial analysis typically available only to institutional clients. By combining Litman‚Äôs forensic accounting expertise with Tilson‚Äôs market experience, the event provides a comprehensive framework for understanding stock market dynamics. The Altimetry Doubles Scanner empowers investors to analyze stocks independently, while the guest speaker‚Äôs insights add depth to the discussion. With the earnings season approaching, the event is timed to help investors prepare for potential market shifts.

Title: Restore Trust In Congress Act‚ÄîMissteps And Mistakes
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewleahey/2025/09/10/restore-trust-in-congress-act-missteps-and-mistakes/

ByAndrew Leahey, Contributor. Every few years, Congress remembers that it probably shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to play the stock market like a fantasy football league with insider information on plays. And, every time, opponents recoil in horror‚Äînot at the ethics violation, but at the idea that members may have to pay taxes if they are forced to sell their holdings. Now comes a bipartisan bill that, at least on paper, seeks to resolve this dilemma by banning individual stock ownership for members of Congress. At the same time, by way of a sweetener, lawmakers propose giving members a tax deferralon any gains from those sales. It is pitched as a compromise, but in reality, it‚Äôs a policy Frankenstein: half ethics reform, half boutique tax shelter, all bad for good government. The Restore Trust in Congress Act does what it says on the label. It prohibits members of Congress, their spouses, and their dependent children from owning or trading individual stocks, commodities, futures, or even derivative assets and options. In short, if it was passed as proposed, it would mean no more betting on Tesla or buying call options on defense contractors while simultaneously hammering out the next Pentagon budget. The bill requires current lawmakers to divest within 180 days, and gives new members 90 days from their swearing-in. It carves out the usual safe harbors‚Äîmore abstract holdings like mutual funds, Treasury bonds, and index funds. Municipal bonds are still fair game, as well. The bill classifies itself as a federal conflict-of-interest statute, which would make divesting members eligible for preferred tax treatment under Section 1043 of the Internal Revenue Code. The provision is designed to allow government officials to defer capital gain taxes when they sell assets in compliance with ethics rules‚Äîprovided they reinvest the proceeds in diversified investments like mutual funds. So instead of a clean ethics rule, we get an ethics rule plus a sweetheart deferral. Congress isn‚Äôt just instructing its members to clean up their portfolios before they swear-in‚Äîit‚Äôs offering them a spoonful of tax break to help the ethical medicine go down. The logic is simple on its face: if you want members of Congress to divest from conflicted asset holdings, you have to make it painless‚Äîif not enjoyable. In tax terms, apparently, there is nothing more painful than realizing the capital gains on long-held stock. The bill tries to remove that obstacle by offering a tax deferral through a certificate of divestiture, which is already available to certain executive branch officials. Supporters argue that this just levels the playing field‚Äîa curious defense. If the problem is public officials profiting from decisions they make in office, then the solution shouldn‚Äôt be contingent on making that transition tax-neutral. The financial inconvenience of paying capital gains taxes owed on investments isn‚Äôt some kind of constitutional crisis created by demanding a more ethical legislature, it‚Äôs a feature of a tax code that applies to everyone else. And since when do we need to incentivize ethics? Lawmakers are public servants, not reluctant volunteers conscripted into duty. If avoiding conflicts of interest is so burdensome, perhaps we‚Äôve misunderstood what it means to serve in public office. If not, why haven‚Äôt we extended the same logic to judges or prosecutors? ‚ÄúYour Honor, we would very much like you to recuse yourself in this case‚Äîbut please allow us to sweeten the deal for you.‚Äù This isn‚Äôt about fairness, it‚Äôs just about comfort. When we start redesigning ethics laws around comfort of the regulated class, we have lost the plot. And that‚Äôs when things start to get messy. For instance, it is worth noting that by extending tax deferral through the divestiture certificate process, we have created a perverse incentive where one might run for office just to claim the benefit. Section 1043 of the tax code was designed for executive branch officials entering roles where holding certain assets could create conflicts. Think, for instance, a cabinet member offloading ExxonMobil stock prior to taking over regulating oil markets. The trigger, however, is specific: the divestiture must be mandatory, and ethics related. This bill goes out of its way to unlock the tax break generally for members. This converts pursuit of public office into a viable tax strategy. Imagine a wealthy private equity partner with a $10 million unrealized gain in Meta. What‚Äôs cheaper, paying the IRS now or launching a well-funded congressional campaign in a friendly district? Suddenly, the Restore Trust in Congress Act looks more like the Monetize Your Portfolio via Congress Act. We already have enough folks running for office to boost their brand, sell a book, or land a television deal‚Äîdo we really want to add ‚Äúdefer my capital gains‚Äù to the list of socially acceptable motives? Even if no one actually runs for Congress just for a tax break‚Äîand let‚Äôs be real, someone will‚Äîthe existence of that incentive speaks volumes. The bill conflates ethics with tax relief and reinforces the idea that lawmakers need a sweet treat to behave ethically. It reduces public trust to a line item on a balance sheet that can be offset by a credit elsewhere. The fundamental question is whether we should be negotiating with members of Congress about the price of not using their office to line their own pockets. Do we really believe stock trading is inherently a conflict of interest? If so, ban it. If not, then stop pretending ethics reform is the goal and just admit this is eyewash. Public services isn‚Äôt supposed to be risk-free or profit-maximizing. It is supposed to be a privilege that comes with equal parts restraint. That isn‚Äôt punitive; it‚Äôs the whole point.

Title: Larry Ellison's Rise: How He Snagged the Title of World's Richest Person From Elon Musk

Time Published: 2025-09-10T17:12:34Z
Full Content:
Oracle's transformation into an AI infrastructure powerhouse has catapulted Larry Ellison ahead of Musk to take the title of the world's richest person. The 81-year-old database pioneer's net worth surged by more than $100 billion following the company's earnings report Tuesday, according to calculations published Wednesday by Bloomberg, which called the move "the biggest one-day increase ever recorded" by its Billionaire's Index. Ellison owns about 1.16 billion shares, or about 41% of the company. As of Tuesday's close, those shares were worth around $280 billion. If Oracle's stock price holds near current levels, Ellison's stake in Oracle would propel his net worth to $393 billion, surpassing Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, whose net worth is $385 billion. The staggering wealth increase came after Oracle announced what CEO Safra Catz called an "excellent" quarter, signing four multi-billion-dollar contracts and booking $455 billion in future cloud infrastructure revenue. Oracle's market capitalization spiked to about $950 billion in intraday trading on Wednesday, up more than $270 billion in a single day. Ellison's gains topped Musk's record for single-day rise in net worth‚Äî$63 billion in December 2024, according to Bloomberg. Oracle reported quarterly revenue of $14.9 billion, up 12% year-over-year, with cloud infrastructure revenue jumping 55% to $3.3 billion. The company's forward-looking metrics were even more headline-making: Oracle's remaining performance obligations (RPO)‚Äîessentially contracts for future revenue‚Äîgrew to $455 billion in value, an increase of 359% year-over-year. "Clearly, it was an excellent quarter, and demand for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure continues to build," CEO Catz told investors during Tuesday's earnings call. "I expect we will sign additional multi-billion-dollar customers and that RPO will likely grow to exceed $500 billion." The company expects cloud infrastructure revenue to reach $18 billion this fiscal year. Oracle's has transformed itself from a traditional database provider into a critical player providing the infrastructure for AI companies in a desperate race for computing power. "Oracle has become the go-to place for AI workloads," Catz told investors, saying the company had signed contracts with OpenAI; xAI, Elon Musk's AI company; Meta Platforms, Inc. (META); Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD); and others. While Ellison's fortune has grown with Oracle's AI boom, Musk's grip on the world's richest title has been loosening throughout 2025. The Tesla CEO began the year with a net worth of $420 billion, which has since fallen to about $385 billion as Tesla shares have declined by about 14% year-to-date. Tesla has struggled with increasing competition in the electric vehicle market and a softening in demand in key markets worldwide. Musk's wealth, tied primarily to his Tesla stake, has fluctuated wildly with the automaker's volatile stock price. Though it's worth noting that Tesla recently floated a new compensation package for Elon Musk, aimed at retaining him, and it's potentially worth $1 trillion. Ellison's record-breaking surge is part of the story of how AI infrastructure has become the new gold rush in tech, with Oracle positioning itself as the critical picks-and-shovels provider for companies racing to build their AI systems. His $100+ billion single-day gain‚Äîdriven by Oracle's $455 billion in future cloud contracts‚Äîshows that the real money in AI may not be in building chatbots or autonomous vehicles, but in providing the computing backbone these technologies require.

The crypto exchange founded by twin brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss looks poised to be the next hot crypto IPO. Gemini Space Station on Wednesday raised the range at which it expects its initial public offering to $24 to $26; it still plans to offer some 16.7 million shares, indicating a market capitalization over $3 billion at the high end. The boosted price suggests strong demand from investors for the shares and follows a string of successful public debuts that includes industry peers like stablecoin operator Circle (CRCL) and institution-focused digital assets platform Bullish (BLSH). The original range was estimated at $17 to $19 per share. Gemini Space Station is expected to list on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker symbol "GEMI." Earlier this week, Gemini secured a $50 million private investment from another exchange operator, Nasdaq (NDAQ), a regulatory filling shows. Nasdaq agreed to pay a per share price equal to the IPO for Class A stock, less underwriting costs and commissions. The Winklevoss twins, famous for their role in the social media network once called Facebook, now known as Meta (META), are also earmarking a set of shares for retail investors. The company expects as much as 30% of Class A shares will be offered to individual investors via brokerages including Robinhood (HOOD) and SoFi (SOFI). Gemini operates one of the better-known crypto exchanges in the U.S. and also has a credit card business. While its trading volume is a fraction of the much larger Coinbase Global (COIN), the company said tokenization and card payments represent "immense untapped potential" for its future growth.

Title: Klarna employees roast its return-to-office plan with emojis as IPO hits the market

Klarna may be celebrating its IPO and $15 billion valuation, but employees seem focused on another matter: return-to-office plans. Klarna informed employees last week that it's set to roll out a return-to-office policy later this month, citing the need to retain top talent that might otherwise leave for companies prioritizing in-person work, as Business Insider exclusively reported. Staff have reacted to the announcement with a wide range of emoji responses, according to a Slack post shared in a channel with roughly 3,000 workers and seen by Business Insider. Comments on the post were disabled, so employees expressed their reactions solely through emojis, which appear to signal strong disapproval of the plans. The responses were varied and, at times, humorous: 341 employees reacted with a sad face emoji, 167 used an emoji reading "no," 149 chose a sweat-faced sad emoji. Additional responses included 41 "this sucks" emojis, and 43 using an emoji based on the viral "Hide the Pain Harold" meme. A small proportion appeared to signal approval of the plans, including 19 thumbs-up emojis and 14 rocket ship emojis. Other popular reactions included 131 sad cat emojis, 90 facepalm emojis, 86 crying emojis, and 73 clown face emojis. Some employees went for more whimsical options: 62 selected the "Homer Simpson backing into a bush" emoji, and 17 used a child going down a slide saying "bye" emoji. Klarna declined to comment. Other tech companies, including Amazon, Dell, and Meta, have implemented RTO policies in recent years. The Swedish fintech said on Tuesday that it set its IPO price at $40 a share as it begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. Samuel Kerr, head of equity capital markets at Mergermarket, said the IPO's pricing is a "tremendous" result for Klarna and its shareholders. He said that all eyes would be on Klarna once trading begins, given the early volatility around recent IPOs. Investors, he said, will closely scrutinize the company's financials, particularly in light of recent losses. Klarna has seen double-digit growth in its users and gross merchandise value, but achieving profitability continues to be a challenge. Losses for the quarter ended June 30 surged to $52 million, up from $7 million a year earlier, even as revenue climbed to $823 million from $682 million. "That scrutiny and Klarna's answers on its evolution and growth could be the determiner of IPO success, as it's hard to draw too much of a parallel between broader fintech listings," Kerr said. In an F-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, Klarna disclosed that it has partnered with and paid over $16 million to climate impact nonprofits founded by the wife of its CEO over the past five years.Have a tip?

Title: Apple's new ultra-thin iPhone has some people excited, but Wall Street doesn't seem convinced
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/air-apple-new-iphone-wall-street-stock-price-tim-cook-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-10T13:41:05Z
Full Content:
Hiya! Got a ton of boring meetings on the docket today? A former Google and Stripe executive has some tips for keeping people engaged. (Hint: Do some prep work.) In today's big story, it was the biggest day of the year for Apple. We break down all the major product announcements and make the case for why the iPhone Air is actually pretty cool. What's on deck: Markets: The stock market is turning into a ticking time bomb, and the growing mountain of rough economic data is the trigger. Tech: It's back to the office for Microsoft workers. And the AI team isn't getting a pass. Business: A first-hand account of buying an apartment in NYC as a Gen Zer. (Yes, it's possible!) But first, Air Apple. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. It's an iPhone, just make it thinner. The star of Apple's big, annual product reveal was the iPhone Air, a slimmed-down version of the popular smartphone. At a whopping 5.6 millimeters ‚Äî that's less than a quarter-inch for metric system haters ‚Äî Apple said the iPhone Air is thin enough to fit on a fingertip. The iPhone Air's smaller size comes with a few sacrifices. Its camera, internal chip, and battery are all a bit of a step down from its bigger siblings. And at $999, it's more than a base model iPhone, making it no bargain. However, Apple says it's making the most of its size, calling it "the most power-efficient iPhone we've ever made" and touting its durability. It might not be the groundbreaking announcement you were hoping for, but iPhone launches rarely are these days. A slightly improved camera here. A moderately better chip there. That's part of the reason why iPhone users hold onto their phones for a lot longer than Apple would like. Apple's big AI push last year was meant to encourage users to finally upgrade their phones, but Apple Intelligence mostly fell flat. So, if you can't attract them with the software, pitch them on the hardware! And the iPhone Air, if nothing else, is pretty impressive to look at. It also appears to have at least one convert. BI's Katie Notopoulos is very excited about the iPhone Air. She explained why the slimmed-down iPhone is exactly what she's been looking for. Still, arguably the toughest and most important critic wasn't impressed. Apple's stock finished the day down almost 1.5%. It wasn't just about the iPhone Air. BI's Sarah Jackson broke down all the big product announcements from Apple. Here are some of the highlights: The other iPhones: The iPhone 17 Pro's camera is comparable to eight professional lenses. It'll cost you at least $1,099, which is $100 more than the iPhone 16 Pro's starting price, but it has more storage (256 GB instead of 128 GB). If you're really trying to ball out, the iPhone 17 Pro Max starts at $1,199. Meanwhile, the entry-level iPhone 17 price of $799 is the same as last year. AirPods Pro 3: The big news here is a heart rate sensor for the gym bros/gals. That could serve as a bridge into more health-related products from Apple. There's also a Live Translation feature powered by Apple Intelligence. The new buds start at $249. Apple Watch: The biggest upgrades are battery life, a scratch-resistant screen, and a better display. The Ultra 3 ($799) can last up to 42 hours on a full charge, while the Series 11 ($399) and SE 3 ($249) will last 24 and 18 hours, respectively. 1. The labor market is a lot cooler than we thought ‚Äî and not in a good way. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 911,000 fewer non-farm jobs were added from April 2024 to March 2025 than previously reported. Most major industry sectors, including leisure and hospitality, saw large downward revisions. 2. How long can stock investors keep ignoring bad economic data? The latest revision to the labor market (see above) wasn't good, and inflation is still a concern. Yet the stock market is already fully valued, and major indexes are sitting at record highs. Once investors flip their stance on the economic data, watch out, BI's Joe Ciolli writes. 3. Citi poaches a longtime IBM executive to pursue its AI ambitions. Shobhit Varshney, the firm's new head of AI, will report to Citi's chief operating officer and work closely with its chief technology officer, according to a memo sent to staff and seen by BI. About 175,000 employees already have access to Citi's AI tools. 1. One of Big Tech's last RTO holdouts is calling workers back to the office. Microsoft employees will be required to go in three days a week, according to an internal email sent to staff and seen by BI. The mandate will happen in three phases, starting at the end of February 2026. And if you're one of Microsoft's AI stars, the RTO guidelines are even stricter. 2. One step closer to mind control? The Pentagon just partnered with Phantom Neuro, a startup that wants to let users control prosthetic limbs with muscle memory. The startup received roughly $300,000 from the DOD's emerging tech group and raised $19 million Series A in April. 3. Verily is restructuring in anticipation of new investors. In a recent town hall meeting, CEO Stephen Gillett told staff that Verily is transforming to a C-corp business structure as it seeks a fresh round of investment. Employees were also told their stock was being revalued, dropping around 80% compared to their 2024 value, according to internal documents viewed by BI. 1. It's giving homeowner. BI reporter and "geriatric Gen Zer" Juliana Kaplan recently bought an apartment in New York City at 28 years old. With a little bit of smart saving and luck, here's how she did it. 2. Whoop's CEO believes in work-life harmony, not work-life balance. The difference is flexibility, the fitness-tech CEO explained in the latest installment of BI's Power Hours. He shared his daily routine, from early morning workouts to cold plunges and meditation. 3. Four-day RTO vs. eight weeks of severance. That's the balance some NBCUniversal employees are weighing in the wake of a return-to-office order set to begin January 5. Unusually, the offer isn't based on employee tenure ‚Äî everyone gets eight weeks regardless of how long they've been there. Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Oracle's stock soared after a report of a cloud contract with OpenAI and an optimistic forecast for its AI-driven cloud infrastructure.The company projects aggressive eight-fold growth in cloud revenue by FY30, leveraging its unique database and networking advantages for AI training and inference services.Key risks include high market expectations, intense competition, significant capital expenditure, and the potential for AI spending to slow. Oracle shares have soared 99% since the beginning of 2025 ‚Äì with more than half of that gain coming in pre-market trading on Wednesday. Why did this happen? After all, the Austin-based tech company announced results for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2026 that fell short of expectations. What sent Oracle stock soaring another 54 percentage points was the company‚Äôs outlook for the future of its cloud infrastructure business, according to CNBC. The future didn‚Äôt take long: The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday afternoon that Oracle and Open AI agreed to ‚Äúone of the largest cloud contracts ever signed," worth a reported $300 billion over five years. Will Oracle stock keep rising? The answer depends on whether the tech giant can beat investor expectations and raise guidance in future quarters. I think there is more upside to the stock for two reasons: However, over the longer-term, Oracle stock may plunge if companies stop investing so heavily in artificial intelligence. That could happen unless more of them reap economic benefits ‚Äì such as faster revenue growth and considerable boosts in productivity. Oracle envisions very fast growth in its cloud infrastructure business. "We expect Oracle Cloud Infrastructure revenue to grow 77% to $18 billion this fiscal year ‚Äî and then increase to $32 billion, $73 billion, $114 billion, and $144 billion over the subsequent four years," CEO Safra Catz in a statement. The OpenAI deal is a big a step in that direction. Oracle‚Äôs results for the quarter fell flat while the company‚Äôs growth forecast generated an outpouring of enthusiasm. Here are the key numbers: The question for investors is whether Oracle‚Äôs bullish growth forecasts suggest a continued rise in its stock. Here‚Äôs the bull case: Oracle‚Äôs latest earnings report suggests growth in demand and much higher revenue driven by companies seeking to benefit from AI. Oracle‚Äôs backlog is likely to grow even more. "We signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers in Q1," Catz said in a statement. Oracle expects to contract with several additional multibillion-dollar customers and for its RPO to exceed half a trillion dollars, Catz added. "We have signed significant cloud contracts with the who‚Äôs who of AI, including OpenAI, xAI, Meta, and many others," Catz said in investor call featured by Yahoo! Finance. Oracle is targeting two related AI markets ‚Äì services for training large language models and for inference ‚Äì generating content from a trained AI model. ‚ÄúMillions of customers are using those AI models to run businesses and governments,‚Äù Oracle co-founder and chairman Larry Ellison said in the investor conference call featured by the Wall Street Journal. ‚ÄúAI inference will be used to run robotic factories, robotic cars, robotic greenhouses, biomolecular simulations for drug designs,‚Äù he added. Oracle‚Äôs unique advantage for AI inference is its databases that store private business data. The company‚Äôs ‚Äúnew AI database will make it easy for those businesses to query or ask questions of their private data, all of which adds to the bill for Oracle‚Äôs AI inference services,‚Äù Ellison said, according to the Journal. Oracle is also investing in AI agents ‚Äì which help people to achieve specific goals such as selecting, booking, and paying for flights and hotels for a journey, as I described in my book Brain Rush. ‚ÄúThe new [applications] that we‚Äôre building, they‚Äôre nothing other than a bunch of AI agents that we generate that are linked together with workflow,‚Äù he added. Oracle enjoys another advantage over cloud services rivals. ‚ÄúI know some of our competitors, they like to own buildings,‚Äù Catz said, according to CNBC. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not really our specialty. Our specialty is the unique technology, the unique networking, the storage ‚Äî just the whole way we put these systems together,‚Äù she added. However, this potential comes with significant risks. The stock‚Äôs premium valuation reflects high market expectations ‚Äì if the market shifts money out of big tech companies or Oracle fails to beat and raise every quarter, its stock could fall. Moreover, the high capital expenditure required to fund its expansion could reduce cash flow and highlights the financial risks involved in its ambitious plans. In addition, Oracle faces significant competition from AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. While the urge to spend more on AI is currently powerful, if the economy goes into a recession, companies who buy cloud services may need to cut costs quickly to preserve cash. And since AI has yet to generate enough of a payoff to justify the investment, as I wrote last month in a Forbes article, such spending could be curtailed if the economy contracts. Last September, generative AI was looking to me like a big dud. While people were using ChatGPT to help them draft emails and reports, there was no killer app ‚Äì akin to what the iTunes store did for the iPod or the electronic spreadsheet did for personal computers, I wrote in the Boston Globe. Last month, MIT reinforced this point with hard numbers. "Despite $30B-$40B in enterprise investment into generative AI, this report uncovers a surprising result in that 95% of organizations are getting zero return," according to a study ‚Äì based on 150 interviews with professionals, a survey of 350 employees, and an analysis of 300 public AI deployments ‚Äì from MIT‚Äôs NANDA Institute featured by SeekingAlpha. The main problem appears to be integrating AI into the enterprise. "Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable profit and loss impact," noted the MIT NANDA Institute report. If companies find ways to make AI pay over the next four years, Oracle‚Äôs cloud services rapid growth could continue. Analysts are mostly enthusiastic about Oracle‚Äôs prospects: One note of caution came from D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria. While Lauria said Oracle‚Äôs projected cloud revenue figure was ‚Äúabsolutely staggering,‚Äù according to CNBC, the business is coming from Microsoft and Google who are ‚Äúoffloading their capacity to other data center providers. These are not organic customers to Oracle,‚Äù he added. While Wall Street is optimistic, 35 analysts who cover the stock set a price target of $263.93, according to TipRanks ‚Äì meaning Oracle stock is 25% over-valued. I see the stock continuing to rise ‚Äì at least until the company‚Äôs next earnings report.

Jeremy Kahn is the AI editor at Fortune, spearheading the publication's coverage of artificial intelligence. He also co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune‚Äôs flagship AI newsletter. Good morning. Hello. It‚Äôs Jeremy here. First up, I want to wish Andrew, who normally writes this newsletter, a big congratulations on the birth of his new baby boy, who made his world debut yesterday! Andrew had to leave Fortune Brainstorm Tech early to greet his new arrival, but let‚Äôs catch him and you up on a few things he missed. Here were some highlights from yesterday: And don‚Äôt forget that you can watch the livestream of the conference‚Äôs final day here.Apple‚Äôs big ‚Äúawe-dropping‚Äù hardware show yesterday ended up being more like a ‚Äúmeh dropping‚Äù (doesn‚Äôt quite have the same ring to it), at least as far as the company‚Äôs investors were concerned. The stock drifted lower in after-hours trading.While the new iPhone Air is impressively svelte and got phone aficionados talking, many of the other announcements‚Äîupdated Apple watches, new AirPods‚Äîwere more niche and unlikely to alter perceptions that the company has lost some of its former mojo. Fortune‚Äôs Dave Smith has a breakdown of the announcements below.Today, the tech world is eagerly awaiting another sort of debut‚Äîfintech Klarna‚Äôs IPO on the NYSE. The Swedish buy-now-pay-later financing firm is expected to price its shares at $40, valuing the company at about $15 billion. That will earn a nice 6x return for venture capital firm Sequoia, which invested about $500 million in Klarna starting back in 2010, according to a story in The Information. But it‚Äôs a lot less than the $46 billion valuation the company achieved in a Softbank-led round in 2021 (a round that Sequoia pointedly did not participate in.) We‚Äôll see how much the stock pops today on opening. Beatrice Nolan has more on Klarna in the news section below.Before we go, be sure to check out Leo Schwarz‚Äôs great profile piece on Ramp, the fast-growing fintech that is automating how corporate finance departments work.And also worth a read is Sharon Goldman‚Äôs feature on Cohere, the Canadian AI company that many considered an also-ran in the AI race but which is making a bid for renewed relevancy with a big hire from Meta, a new CFO, and a $7 billion valuation.Onwards‚Ä¶‚ÄîJeremy Kahn Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Fortune Tech? Drop a line here. Apple‚Äôs ‚ÄúAwe Dropping‚Äù event has wrapped‚Äîand the focus of Tuesday‚Äôs show was mobile devices: the iPhone, the Watch, and AirPods. In total, Apple unveiled eight new products, including a brand-new member of the iPhone family, the iPhone Air. Highlights include the AirPods Pro 3 with improved ANC, live translation, and built-in heart-rate tracking. Three new Watches, the Series 11 with blood pressure monitoring and better durability, the SE 3 with an always-on display and faster charging, and the rugged Ultra 3 with satellite connectivity and a record 42-hour battery. On the phone side, Apple introduced the iPhone 17 with a ProMotion display, upgraded cameras, and the new iPhone Air as a fresh model in the lineup. The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max bring lighter builds, ceramic shield backs, major camera upgrades, and the longest iPhone battery life ever. Here‚Äôs the full rundown of everything the tech giant announced at its annual event. The launches come as Apple leans on hardware innovation to buy time for its delayed AI strategy, with Wall Street watching closely to see if these devices can spark stronger upgrade cycles. ‚Äî Dave Smith Klarna's long-awaited initial public offering (IPO) is finally here. The buy-now-pay-later financing firm is expected to price its shares at $40 per share, valuing the company at about $15 billion, significantly lower than the $45 billion valuation it achieved in 2021. Despite the lower valuation, major investor Sequoia is set to gain nearly $3 billion from its $500 million investment in the company over the last 15 years, per The Information. The fintech, which was once Europe‚Äôs most valuable VC-backed company, has been planning the listing for years but economic and political headwinds, including sweeping U.S. tariffs have delayed its market debut several times. Investors are hopeful the company could set a trend for high-growth fintech listings after a period of slowdown in both tech IPOs and M&A activity. Losses in the first half of the fiscal year and an internal AI pullback could cast a shadow over Klarna‚Äôs IPO. Investors will be watching closely to see if the company can pull off a strong market debut. ‚Äî Beatrice Nolan As Congress considers new rules that restrict the sale of AI chips to China, Nvidia has a new strategy to protect the billion-dollar market. The Senate and the House are weighing rules that would require U.S. companies to prioritize domestic access to the technology before it can be sold abroad. To tackle this and protect the potentially $50 billion market, the chipmaker has painted the limits as left-wing paranoia pushed by a group of AI doomers, according to a report from The New York Times. Nvidia‚Äôs aggressive push has rattled Republicans backing the restrictions and pulled Washington into what is primarily a Silicon Valley-based clash between ‚Äúaccelerationists,‚Äù who want to supercharge AI growth, and ‚Äúdoomers,‚Äù who raise concerns about the technology‚Äôs risks. David Sacks, the White House AI czar, has reiterated Nvidia‚Äôs attacks, labeling the regulation advocates a ‚Äúdoomer cult.‚Äù On his All-In podcast, Sacks even suggested they should be ‚ÄúLoomered,‚Äù suggesting far-right activist Laura Loomer should campaign to get them dismissed. The Senate is expected to vote on the amendment, which could reshape the U.S.‚ÄìChina tech relations, as early as Tuesday. ‚Äî Beatrice Nolan OpenAI‚Äôs largest investor is working with rival AI lab, Anthropic. Microsoft is set to use Anthropic‚Äôs tech for AI features in Office 365 after executives found Claude Sonnet 4 outperformed OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-5 in some tasks, according to a report from The Information. Microsoft has said the $30-per-month Copilot add-on already has over 100 million users, and analysts estimate it could be a $1 billion annual business. Microsoft will access Anthropic‚Äôs models through Amazon Web Services, and the move will blend Anthropic and OpenAI‚Äôs technology in the apps. It‚Äôs the latest sign that Microsoft is taking steps to lessen its reliance on its closer partner in the AI space. This isn‚Äôt Microsoft‚Äôs first pivot away from OpenAI: earlier this year, the company announced that its GitHub Copilot codewriting tools would use Anthropic‚Äôs models to power advanced ‚Äúagent‚Äù features, rather than relying solely on OpenAI. The move comes amid months of negotiations between OpenAI and the tech giant over the ChatGPT maker‚Äôs plan to restructure its for-profit division in preparation for a potential public offering. ‚Äî Beatrice Nolan PwC U.K. cuts entry-level hiring amid AI uncertainty. The firm's U.K. chief admitted that graduate hiring is ‚Äúunder pressure.‚Äù U.S. tech companies accused of enabling China‚Äôs digital police state. An AP investigation found that Amazon, IBM, and Dell helped build China‚Äôs surveillance state. Robinhood says its latest product will fix social media trading. The trading giant has a new app feature called ‚ÄúRobinhood Social‚Äù where users can follow prominent traders. Oracle soars on ambitious cloud growth forecasts. Oracle‚Äôs shares surged after projecting $144 billion in cloud infrastructure revenue by 2030. Meta‚Äôs new AI team is stirring up new tensions with old staff. Meta‚Äôs recruitment of high-paid AI stars is creating divides within the company. ¬© 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

ByMartina Di Licosa, Contributor. Few things could make the average billionaire feel poor‚ÄîThe Forbes 400 list is one of them. There are now a record 900 billionaires in the U.S., meaning a record 500 people have amassed a ten-figure fortune but are still simply not rich enough to make the top 400 in 2025. It‚Äôs a tough list to crack, and getting tougher. Back in 1982, there were fewer than two dozen billionaires on the original Forbes 400, which required a minimum net worth of just $100 million to make the cut. Four decades later, it now takes $3.8 billion to make the ranking, up $500 million from just a year ago. More than 90% of last year‚Äôs list held onto their spot this year. Still, 19 billionaires worth $3.7 billion came up just short of stealing a place on the ranking. That includes design software firm Figma‚Äôs cofounder Dylan Field and athleisure brand Alo Yoga‚Äôs cofounders Danny Harris and Marco DeGeorge, as well as Dario Amodei and five other cofounders of AI juggernaut Anthropic (a seventh cofounder of the company, Christopher Olah, is also worth $3.7 billion but is Canadian). Another 11 billionaires missed the cut by just $200 million, with a $3.6 billion fortune. Those rich enough to make Forbes‚Äô billionaires list but not rich enough to make The Forbes 400 also include some of the world‚Äôs most famous people. Embattled WWE boss Vince McMahon is $400 million too poor. Oprah Winfrey would need another $700 million to make the grade. Taylor Swift, who has added an additional $500 million to her fortune since Forbes first named her a billionaire in 2023 on the back of her global Eras Tour, is still $2.2 billion short. Several recent additions to the billionaires list missed this year‚Äôs Forbes 400 as well, including South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone (net worth: $1.2 billion apiece) and Chipotle founder Steve Ells, who has fallen from the billionaire ranks amid the fast-casual Mexican restaurant chain‚Äôs slumping stock price. There‚Äôs always next year for these billionaires. Just ask Robinhood cofounder Vlad Tenev, Dutch Bros coffee cofounder Travis Boersma, and the 12 other billionaires who made The Forbes 400 for the first time in 2025. The brains behind South Park got rich one offensive episode at a time. Now in its 27th season, the hit show has won four Emmys, and its creators ranked #1 on Forbes‚Äô most recent list of the highest-paid TV showrunners. Parker and Stone became billionaires in July after they signed a $1.5 billion streaming deal to bring South Park to Paramount+ globally. The first active NBA player to become a billionaire, his athletic talent has earned him more than $500 million in pretax salary over the course of his two-decade career with the Cleveland Cavaliers, Miami Heat, and his current team, the Los Angeles Lakers. Then there‚Äôs his off-court earnings, upwards of $900 million pretax, from business ventures like production company SpringHill and endorsement deals with brands including Nike and Beats by Dre. Swift holds the record for the most albums to sell one million copies in a single week in the modern era, with seven of her albums, including 1989 (Taylor's Version) and The Tortured Poets Department, reaching that milestone in seven days. She toured her way into the billionaire ranks, joining the list in 2023 while traveling the globe on her Eras Tour, which generated more than $2 billion of revenue and ranks as the highest-grossing concert tour of all time. Her family made her famous, but most of Kardashian‚Äôs wealth comes from shapewear brand Skims, which she founded in 2019 and is expanding internationally with stores in London and Dubai. In 2022, she cofounded private equity firm SKKY Partners, which has invested in companies like UK-based luxury skincare brand 111SKIN and premium, truffle-based sauce and condiments purveyor TRUFF. Field cofounded web-based design company Figma in 2012 after dropping out of Brown University. In 2022, he agreed to sell his startup to Adobe for $20 billion, but the deal was killed by regulators. Figma went public in July 2025, and its stock more than tripled on its first trading day. It‚Äôs lost nearly 40% of its value since, with the company reporting slower sales growth and worse-than-expected earnings for the second quarter of 2025, as well as third-quarter guidance that disappointed analysts and investors. Londsdale got his start working for billionaire investor Peter Thiel's hedge fund. He is now the managing partner of $6 billion (assets) venture capital firm 8VC. He cofounded data mining firm Palantir in 2003; it now has a market capitalization of $370 billion. Lonsdale was also an early investor in Palmer Luckey's Anduril. Scale AI‚Äôs cofounder and former CEO briefly became the world‚Äôs youngest self-made billionaire in 2022, at age 25, after private investors valued his data labeling company at $7.3 billion. Then private markets plunged and knocked Wang from the billionaire ranks. He regained his title in 2024, when Scale raised $1 billion at a $13.8 billion valuation, and has held onto it ever since. In June, Wang‚Äôs fortune soared by $1.2 billion, to $3.2 billion, after Meta paid more than $14 billion for 49% of Scale, and Wang left Scale to become the social media giant‚Äôs new chief AI officer. As CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, Lutnick rebuilt the trading and investment management firm after 658 employees died in the 9/11 attacks. Now he‚Äôs serving in the Trump administration as Secretary of Commerce, focusing on tariffs, and has turned the company's management over to a trio of co-CEOs. Luckey got rich creating Oculus VR and, more recently, selling weapons. His defense startup Anduril boomed with the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. ‚ÄúWe want to be the company that when the DoD needs something, we're the first people they think of,‚Äù he told Forbes at the time. Now he‚Äôs building crypto bank Erebor, which is awaiting regulatory approval. The Blackstone executive‚Äôs Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment (HBSE) owns stakes in the NBA‚Äôs Philadelphia 76ers, the NHL‚Äôs New Jersey Devils, and the Premier League‚Äôs Crystal Palace. Blitzer also has stakes in the Cleveland Guardians baseball team, and he co-owns MLS squad Real Salt Lake. Harris and Degeorge began selling clothing together right out of high school. Today, their athleisure brand Alo Yoga is bringing in an estimated $2 billion in revenue and has been seen on influencers like Kendall Jenner and Georgina Rodr√≠guez. In August, Harris told Vogue Business that the brand will be launching a line of leather purses priced in the thousands in an effort to break into the luxury market. Formerly the vice president of research at OpenAI, Amodei is now the CEO of AI firm Anthropic, which built chatbot Claude. He cofounded the company in 2021 with six other former OpenAI employees, including his sister Daniela Amodei. Anthropic raised $13 billion at a $183 billion valuation in early September.
