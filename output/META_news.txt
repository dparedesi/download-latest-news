ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 20: (L-R) Priscilla Chan, Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, Lauren Sanchez, ... More Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla CEO Elon Musk attend the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol on January 20, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Tens of billions of dollars in personal wealth vanished in just months. As the economy shifts and policies reset, two of the world’s most influential entrepreneurs - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and Meta (NASDAQ:META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg - are seeing the value of their holdings shrink. Not because they misstepped, but because the ground beneath them shifted: politics, markets, and public expectations are rewriting the rules of success. For more on Meta’s success see M&A: Meta’s Four Critical Acquisitions. It isn’t uncommon for founder wealth to fluctuate dramatically - mostly because the bulk of their wealth is tied to a single stock. But that shouldn’t be you. The High Quality portfolio, designed to sidestep stock-specific shocks and lower volatility, has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception So who lost more? And what does it tell us about the next chapter for American business? Musk lost nearly $100 billion or >20% of his net worth, while Zuckerberg, unlike the crash of 2022, saw his wealth decline by only 6.5% closely mimicking the stock decline this year. Wealth Comparison: Musk vs Zuckerberg Both remain among the wealthiest individuals globally, but the scale of the decline - especially Musk’s - is notable. So far in 2025: While much of this has to do with the broader market decline resulting from Trump’s push for tariffs, there is more to the story for each of the stocks. Tesla’s stock initially surged after Donald Trump’s 2024 election win, driven by optimism around protectionist manufacturing policies and possibly Musk’s closeness with the president. However, those gains evaporated quickly as the realities of a highly competitive EV market - including intense pressure from Chinese manufacturers - set in. Tesla’s Q1 2025 vehicle deliveries missed expectations and its margins fell to the lowest level seen in the last 5 years. Meta’s decline, meanwhile, reflects slower-than-expected growth in digital advertising and longer timelines for AI-driven monetization, alongside continued investment losses in its Reality Labs division. It’s important to understand: Wealth - specifically from stock ownership - is not taxed, and taxes are due when stock is sold and wealth becomes income. However, when billionaires pledge shares as collateral for personal loans, a falling stock price can impact debt covenants. Lenders may require repayment or more collateral if the value of pledged shares declines substantially. If borrowers are unable or unwilling to provide more collateral, they may have to sell stock - potentially under less favorable conditions. At this time: So far, no public filings suggest Musk has faced such a situation of forced liquidation in 2025 - but the risk is structurally higher compared to Zuckerberg, who has historically avoided significant personal leverage against Meta shares. This isn’t just a scoreboard of billionaire wealth. There are deeper implications: Founders’ wealth is highly concentrated in companies they run. And that means large fluctuations - but that’s fine. They can take the risk as they run those companies. But when it comes to long-term money compounding for most of us - a simple rule is - never put all your eggs in one basket. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio is designed to diversify stock-specific risk while providing exposure to the upside. With a collection of 30 stocks, it has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) and reminds investors of the May 5, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. Then, on March 26, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a report (the “Muddy Waters Report”) concluding that AppLovin systematically used proprietary third-party data in ways that violated the terms of service of Facebook, Google, Snap, Reddit, as well as other platforms, potentially leading to backlash and service blocking and threatening the sustainability of AppLovin’s revenue growth. On this news, AppLovin’s stock price plummeted 20.1 percent, dropping from $327.62 to $261.70 per share on March 27, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding AppLovin’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the AppLovin class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/APP or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Title: 100 days into Trump's economy, one thing's clear: Americans are worried
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/100-days-trump-economy-drama-uncertainty-stagflation-consumers-tariffs-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-04-29T13:58:35Z

Good morning. Mark Carney's Liberal Party is projected to win the election in Canada. Celebrating the victory, Carney had a message for his supporters: "As I've been warning for months, America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country. Never." In today's big story, it's the 100th day since President Donald Trump took office again. BI explored how people feel, how markets have changed, and what tariffs could mean for what's coming next. What's on deck Markets: Five charts show how Elon Musk and Tesla have fared since Trump took office. Tech: ChatGPT has a flattery problem. Sam Altman says a fix is coming. Business: Walmart is America's favorite grocer, but don't underestimate Costco. But first, what a wild start. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. He's been busy. He issued a blizzard of executive orders. He launched an unprecedented global trade war and gutted large swaths of the federal government. He spoke about annexing Greenland, taking control of the Panama Canal, and making Canada the 51st state. The first 100 days of Trump's second term can be defined by one word: uncertainty. Consumers don't appear to like it. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index has declined every month this year — and it may deteriorate further once the full effects of tariffs take hold, a Moody's Analytics economist told BI. Peek at it through your fingers if you must — the chart above is a scary one: the S&P 500's start to the year. After Trump announced new tariffs on April 2, the stock market suffered a historic sell-off. The index then somewhat recovered, only to dip again on April 16 after Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned of higher inflation and slower economic growth — the dreaded stagflation scenario. Through it all, one chart climbs higher: the US Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, which has almost doubled since January. Predicting what comes next is a tall order, but implementing tariffs could result in a surge in inflation and more stock sell-offs, BI's Madison Hoff and Matthew Fox write. More reorganization in the federal government could also mean more job seekers for fewer positions, sending unemployment higher. BI examined sentiment data, markets chaos, and interviews with small business owners, consumers, and economists. They point toward one thing: Americans are worried. 1. This week is going to be huge for the stock market. Investors will get new data on inflation, the labor market, and economic growth, while four of the Magnificent Seven are set to report earnings. Each event could majorly shift markets. 2. How Tesla has suffered from Elon Musk's MAGA moment. Tesla's stock price is down 43% since its mid-December peak, and Musk's net worth has plunged by some $150 billion. Five charts show how the car company and its CEO have fared since Trump took office. 3. When could a recession happen? Apollo's chief economist outlined how Trump's tariffs — especially duties on Chinese goods — could kick off a downturn, with effects starting as soon as next month. 1. Big Law is losing top talent to AI startups. Disillusioned with Big Law's heavy workloads and the long road to partner, young attorneys are betting on AI legal-tech startups instead. Startups offer stock options and flexible work, but they still can't match Big Law salaries. 2. Activists want Meta's receipts on content moderation. Anti-hate groups are pressing Meta shareholders to back a new proposal that includes a report on how Meta handles hate speech. Meta's board has urged shareholders to vote against the proposal. 3. ChatGPT can be a major suck-up. Recent updates have led ChatGPT to really hype up users, sparking debates about whether the behavior is a growth strategy or an "emergent" feature. Here's what OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had to say. 1. Domino's delivery bites the dust. Domino's delivery sales fell 1.5% in Q1 as its carryout sales rose 1%, suggesting customers opted for pickup to save money. It could signal a coming change in delivery trends as recession fears rise. 2. Walmart still reigns as America's grocery king. For the third year running, more than one in five dollars spent on groceries in the US goes to Walmart, according to consumer analytics firm Numerator. But Costco is rapidly gaining ground despite the competition. 3. A federal judge seems poised to hand Big Law another win. DOJ attorney Richard Lawson argued that Trump's executive order targeting the firm Jenner & Block wasn't illegal. A federal judge wasn't having it, calling Lawson's interpretation "a pretty strange reading." The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York (on parental leave).

Title: Why Arun Kumar of FundsIndia backs investment styles others are avoiding

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Arun Kumar, vice-president and head of research at FundsIndia, has a distinct style of investing in mutual funds, one that leans heavily on value investing. Around 55% of his portfolio is parked in funds that follow a value style of investing. In an interaction withMintfor the Guru Portfolio series, Kumar shared his contrarian approach when it comes to picking mutual funds for his portfolio. “I like it when certain investment styles or investment approaches are not doing well," he says. What has changed in your portfolio in the last one year?I have always been equity-heavy. Currently, my portfolio is 90% equity, and the remaining 10% is in debt and arbitrage funds. I’m comfortable with this because my wife and I have active income and contribute 10-15% of the portfolio value each year. Even during bear markets, we contribute to the portfolio. However, as our portfolio grows over time, our savings might not catch up with it. There will be a time when our portfolios will become so big that we’ll not be able to add meaningfully (less than 5%) to our portfolios. At that time, I will shift to a more conservative portfolio and keep it 70% equity, 15% gold, and 15% debt and debt-like investments. How is your equity portion bifurcated?A chunk of my portfolio, 55%, is in four funds. I have a natural bias towards value investing as a style and have invested in funds that fund managers manage with a value bias. It’s split across Sankaran Naren’s ICICI India Opportunities, Rajeev Thakkar's PPFAS FlexiCap, Kenneth Andrade’s Old Bridge focused equity fund, and HDFC FlexiCap, which Prashant Jain earlier managed. Another 15% of our portfolio is to make slightly concentrated bets. I am bullish on banking as a sector and put all this portion in one banking stock. I feel that the NPA cycle has been cleaned up, and the credit growth cycle is about to start. Banks also have a strong balance sheet because they had over-prepared for covid, but the impact wasn’t as bad as we thought. Banking is a good sector going through a bad time with decent valuations, and I’m hoping for a reversal in the future. The other 15% is spread across the globe. I had taken a bet in Chinese tech through Mirae’s Hang Seng Tech ETF two years ago. It didn’t do well for some time, but started playing out in the last one year. I also had an SIP in a Nasdaq fund. When the markets crashed in 2022, I built up my position in a FAANG [Meta (formerly Facebook), Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet (formerly Google)] stock, which was part of that index. That stock has gone up 4x, leading to slightly skewed exposure. The remaining 5% is allocated to mid- and small-cap funds. I did not have any allocation to mid- and small-cap before and missed the whole rally. The only exposure I had was indirectly through flexi-cap funds that had some exposure to such companies. I was already too much into equities and didn’t want to get too aggressive. Over time, the plan is to gradually start building the small and mid-cap exposure. View Full Image Mint Also Read: Why Marcellus’ Saurabh Mukherjea has 40% global weight What are the hits and misses from your portfolio in the past one year?I had missed the whole small and mid-cap rally. I did not have any funds from that category, and the only allocation I had was through my flexi cap. Learning from this experience, I have now put in place a framework to play small caps. SIP can also be a simple way to build exposure. What additions are you looking to make to your portfolio?I like it when certain investment styles or investment approaches are not doing well. Lately, momentum-oriented funds have not been doing great, and I am looking at it, although I haven’t made up my mind. We also didn’t have many options before, but now we have plenty of them. Quality is another style that has dramatically underperformed in the last four years, and I see some early signs of a turnaround. I am now looking at quality schemes and will slowly build up exposure there. That is what I’ll focus on for the next few months. Can you elaborate on your thesis on the quality theme?Everyone wants high-quality companies with high ROCE (return on capital employed), low debt, consistent earnings, high earnings growth potential, and good management at decent valuations. It’s very difficult to get all of these in one stock. So, quality fund managers usually end up compromising on the valuations front. This overpaying has come to bite them in the past four years. When the markets rebounded, it was a broad-based recovery where all stocks, regardless of their quality, were growing their earnings at a rapid pace, and so there was no need to pay an exorbitant price for quality. But when the market starts going through a tough phase, and only a few good quality companies are winning, that’s when quality starts performing. While it’s tough to time styles, the recent underperformance and the moderating growth environment with a lot of uncertainty thrown in augurs well for quality. Overall, it seems like a good place for quality to start working again. When the tide turns is anybody's guess, but at least it’s crucial to remain consistent with our process. Also Read: Look who's making a comeback: Quality vs value investing What quality scheme are you looking at?I like UTI Flexi cap for sticking to its quality investment style even when it has fallen out of favour. Have you exited any position?I have hardly sold any of my funds since I started seriously investing in 2015. I have redeemed a few small allocations here and there to clean my portfolio. However, I’ve kept all my core holdings. I buy funds mostly by looking at the fund manager. As long as the same fund manager runs the fund, I don’t mind even if it’s underperforming. HDFC Flexi cap is one scheme that I bought due to Prashant Jain, but he left HDFC in 2022. However, I continued holding that scheme because the current manager, Roshi Jain, manages the fund reasonably well. What would make you sell?As a thumb rule, I would contemplate selling when the fund manager changes or there is a significant change or dilution from the stated investment approach. Another aspect is on the performance front. If the returns deteriorate and I am not able to understand the reason behind it, then that can be an issue. But let’s say a fund manager who follows a quality style is underperforming, and all others with the same style and index are also struggling; then it’s okay. In this case, underperformance is not an issue. In fact, I bought most of my schemes when the fund manager was underperforming. In contrast, if you’re following a certain style and are performing poorly when others following the same style are doing well, then that's a sign to sell out.

Backing good fund managers during tough phases: Buying into skilled fund managers who are going through challenging times—but sticking to their proven approach—often pays off. The magic of compounding also becomes truly meaningful once the portfolio reaches a reasonable size. It’s also important to track incremental savings. It helps in two ways:identifying where you can get a bigger bang for your buck and deciding how much time and effort to allocate between increasing savings versus chasing higher returns. It also brings the focus back to what truly matters: growing the overall portfolio through a combination of steady savings and returns. Lastly, behaviour beats brilliance: Sticking to the plan is hard because of the three S: Scare you: The equity market tries to scare you into selling through ABCD (all-time highs; bad news; crash predictions; cash calls by experts; declines) Slow you down with entry anxiety: Waiting for a 10% correction to deploy funds—as it always feels like markets will fall further. Seduce you with ABCD: Temptations to go all in; borrow to invest; chase performance and concentrate heavily; derivatives and day trading.Mint's Guru Portfolio series features leaders in the financial services industry who share their money management secrets.

A chunk of my portfolio, 55%, is in four funds. I have a natural bias towards value investing as a style and have invested in funds that fund managers manage with a value bias. It’s split across Sankaran Naren’s ICICI India Opportunities, Rajeev Thakkar's PPFAS FlexiCap, Kenneth Andrade’s Old Bridge focused equity fund, and HDFC FlexiCap, which Prashant Jain earlier managed. Another 15% of our portfolio is to make slightly concentrated bets. I am bullish on banking as a sector and put all this portion in one banking stock. I feel that the NPA cycle has been cleaned up, and the credit growth cycle is about to start. Banks also have a strong balance sheet because they had over-prepared for covid, but the impact wasn’t as bad as we thought. Banking is a good sector going through a bad time with decent valuations, and I’m hoping for a reversal in the future. The other 15% is spread across the globe. I had taken a bet in Chinese tech through Mirae’s Hang Seng Tech ETF two years ago. It didn’t do well for some time, but started playing out in the last one year. I also had an SIP in a Nasdaq fund. When the markets crashed in 2022, I built up my position in a FAANG [Meta (formerly Facebook), Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet (formerly Google)] stock, which was part of that index. That stock has gone up 4x, leading to slightly skewed exposure. The remaining 5% is allocated to mid- and small-cap funds. I did not have any allocation to mid- and small-cap before and missed the whole rally. The only exposure I had was indirectly through flexi-cap funds that had some exposure to such companies. I was already too much into equities and didn’t want to get too aggressive. Over time, the plan is to gradually start building the small and mid-cap exposure.

I did not have any funds from that category, and the only allocation I had was through my flexi cap. Learning from this experience, I have now put in place a framework to play small caps. SIP can also be a simple way to build exposure. What additions are you looking to make to your portfolio?I like it when certain investment styles or investment approaches are not doing well. Lately, momentum-oriented funds have not been doing great, and I am looking at it, although I haven’t made up my mind. We also didn’t have many options before, but now we have plenty of them. Quality is another style that has dramatically underperformed in the last four years, and I see some early signs of a turnaround. I am now looking at quality schemes and will slowly build up exposure there. That is what I’ll focus on for the next few months. Can you elaborate on your thesis on the quality theme?Everyone wants high-quality companies with high ROCE (return on capital employed), low debt, consistent earnings, high earnings growth potential, and good management at decent valuations. It’s very difficult to get all of these in one stock. So, quality fund managers usually end up compromising on the valuations front. This overpaying has come to bite them in the past four years. When the markets rebounded, it was a broad-based recovery where all stocks, regardless of their quality, were growing their earnings at a rapid pace, and so there was no need to pay an exorbitant price for quality.

Title: If the U.S. Avoids a Recession, the Mag 7 Will Win Big—and How to Trade While Waiting for Confirmati (Serhii Bondarenko)

Wall Street analysts expect the “Magnificent Seven” tech giants—Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla—to deliver an average 15% profit growth in 2025, a forecast that’s barely budged despite rising trade tensions. Should the U.S. economy sidestep a recession, these seven companies are uniquely positioned to outperform. Meanwhile, volatility (VIX) readings can guide whether to lean on Tickeron’s AI Double Agent strategies or revert to simple buy-and-hold—and if the Mag 7 stumbles, you can hedge with inverse ETFs like QID. Why Apple Wins: Services division with >60% gross margins cushions hardware cyclicality. 1.8 billion active devices underpin a recurring upgrade cycle. $200 B+ net cash supports buybacks and dividends. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Run the AAPL Double Agent—long AAPL vs. its inverse (e.g., SCC, ProShares UltraShort Consumer Discretionary). VIX < 20: Buy & hold to capture steady services growth. AI Trading Double Agent – Outperforming Apple Inc. (AAPL) The AI Trading Double Agent strategy is uniquely positioned to outperform traditional trading methods when applied to Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the ProShares UltraShort QQQ (QID). By combining long positions in AAPL, a global leader in technology and innovation, with a hedge using QID, this approach capitalizes on bullish trends in individual equities and bearish swings within the broader tech sector. The dual-strategy framework allows traders to navigate volatile markets effectively, ensuring that profit opportunities are maximized regardless of market direction. This innovative system leverages advanced algorithms and real-time data analysis to identify optimal entry and exit points, making it particularly effective in responding to rapid shifts in sentiment or macroeconomic factors influencing technology stocks. The modern trading landscape demands speed and precision, and Agentic AI is revolutionizing the field with multi-agent architectures. One such innovation is the Double Agent Trading Bot, a cutting-edge system designed to capitalize on both bullish and bearish market conditions. By combining advanced pattern recognition with strategic hedging, particularly through inverse ETFs, this bot provides an intelligent and adaptive approach to autotrading. Its dual-strategy framework enables traders to navigate volatile markets more efficiently, making it a powerful tool for both seasoned and novice investors. Inverse ETFs play a crucial role in this strategy by offering a means to profit from declining markets. These funds are engineered to move inversely to a specific index, allowing traders to hedge against downturns without short-selling. For instance, if the NASDAQ-100 drops by 2%, an inverse ETF tracking the index is expected to gain roughly 2%. Such ETFs are commonly used for short-term hedging due to their susceptibility to compounding effects and tracking errors over extended periods. The ProShares UltraShort QQQ (QID), for example, is one such inverse ETF based on the NASDAQ-100 index, making it a viable hedge against tech-sector volatility. AAPL and QID: Analyzing the Anticorrelation Dynamics The chart illustrates the performance of Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the ProShares UltraShort QQQ ETF (QID) over a one-year period, highlighting an apparent anticorrelation between the two assets. AAPL's stock price shows a generally upward trend, with significant gains throughout the year, culminating in a 33.23% increase by March 2025. In contrast, QID, which is designed to provide double inverse exposure to the Nasdaq-100 index, exhibits a downward trajectory, reflecting losses that amount to -13.56% over the same period. This inverse relationship suggests that as AAPL's stock price rises, QID tends to decline, and vice versa. This anticorrelation can be attributed to several factors, including AAPL's significant weight in the Nasdaq-100 index, which QID seeks to short. As AAPL performs well, it positively impacts the Nasdaq-100, leading to losses for QID, which aims to profit from declines in the index. Investors often use such relationships to hedge risk or capitalize on market movements by taking opposing positions in correlated or anticorrelated assets. However, it is important to note that while the chart shows a strong historical pattern, future performance is not guaranteed, and other market dynamics could influence these trends.

AI‑Powered Hedging with Double Agent NVDA/NVDS To safeguard portfolios against the kind of abrupt sell‑off NVIDIA may face in China—whether from export‑control news or broader market shocks—Tickeron offers its AI Trading Double Agent NVDA/NVDS strategy. This dual‑agent framework runs two complementary AI modules in parallel: Bull Agent (NVDA): Continuously scans technical indicators, volume patterns, and NVIDIA‑specific news feeds to identify high‑probability long entry points. When the AI detects sustained bullish momentum—such as breakouts on accelerating volume or positive revisions to analyst forecasts—it allocates capital to NVDA, capturing upside efficiently. Bear Agent (NVDS): Simultaneously monitors risk signals—like widening bid‑ask spreads, sudden drops in open interest, or negative regulatory headlines—and automatically shifts exposure into NVDS, a bespoke inverse instrument designed to profit from NVIDIA’s declines. The Bear Agent employs tight stop‑loss logic and dynamically adjusts position size based on real‑time volatility, ensuring that losses are contained and hedges are scaled appropriately. By orchestrating these two agents under a unified risk‑management umbrella, the Double Agent system maintains a net market‑neutral stance when signals conflict, or a directional tilt when one view decisively outweighs the other. Backtests over the past two years show the Double Agent NVDA/NVDS strategy: Reduces Maximum Drawdowns by over 40% versus a simple buy‑and‑hold NVDA position during major sell‑offs. Improves Risk‑Adjusted Returns, with a Sharpe ratio nearly 2× that of NVDA alone. Executes Automatically in milliseconds, eliminating emotional delays and ensuring that hedges are in place the moment bearish conditions emerge. Why Meta Wins: AI-driven ad targeting and potential Reality Labs inflection. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Run META Double Agent, flipping into PSQ or SQQQ when engagement metrics wobble. VIX < 20: Buy & hold to capture high-margin ad profits. Why Tesla Wins: EV market share gains and improving battery margins. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Use TSLA/TSLQ Double Agent, hedging with TZA (Daily Small Cap Bear 3X) or SILJ (MicroSectors Silver 3X) if you need broader market or metal-linked protection. VIX < 20: Buy & hold to benefit from long-term EV adoption. Tesla, Inc. remains one of the most dynamic companies in the world, leading the charge in electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing, energy generation, and storage solutions. As the largest automaker by market capitalization, Tesla has demonstrated its ability to innovate and disrupt traditional industries. With electric vehicles growing in popularity and a global push towards sustainability, Tesla's stock has experienced remarkable growth over the past few years. AI Trading Bot recommends a BUY LONG position on TSLA, reflecting the ongoing optimism about Tesla’s long-term prospects. The company’s expanding product lineup, including electric trucks, energy storage solutions, and advancements in autonomous driving technology, continues to position it as a leader in the future of transportation and energy. In conjunction with the long position in TSLA, the AI Trading Bot also recommends buying TSDD, the GraniteShares 2x Short TSLA Daily ETF. This ETF is designed to provide investors with a leveraged inverse exposure to Tesla’s stock, allowing traders to hedge against the potential for downside movements in Tesla’s share price. Given Tesla’s volatile nature, the hedging strategy of holding TSDD alongside TSLA allows traders to balance their exposure. The ability to capitalize on both the upward and downward movements of Tesla's stock makes this pairing an effective trading strategy for advanced traders seeking dynamic risk management solutions. When the Mag 7 names collectively stumble or the Nasdaq-heavy indices roll over, consider these inverse ETFs as tactical hedges: QID (ProShares UltraShort QQQ): A 2× inverse of the Nasdaq-100—ideal to hedge broad tech pullbacks. SDS (ProShares UltraShort S&P 500): A 2× inverse of the S&P 500—useful when broader indices slump alongside tech. SOXS (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3×): A 3× inverse of the PHLX Semiconductor Index—targets semiconductor-specific declines. SPXS (Direxion Daily S&P 500 Bear 3×): A 3× inverse of the S&P 500—aggressive hedge in deep downturns. Tactical Example: If VIX spikes above 25 and you’re long NVDA, a quick long position in QID can offset 2× losses as GPUs underperform. When volatility subsides (VIX < 20), unwind QID and shift back to buy-and-hold your core Mag 7 positions. High Volatility (VIX > 25): Markets are prone to abrupt reversals. Tickeron’s AI Double Agents automate hedging across both single-name and broad inverse ETFs, limiting drawdowns. Low Volatility (VIX < 20): Trends become more reliable. A buy-and-hold approach on high-quality names captures secular growth with minimal friction. Earnings beats can reinforce the Mag 7’s leadership; misses may prompt tactical hedges. Date Company Release Time Consensus EPS Consensus Revenue Trading Note Tue, Apr 22 Tesla (TSLA) 4:07 PM ET; Call 5:30 $0.43 $21.8 B Beat? Unwind TSLA/TSLQ hedge; Miss? Add NVDS or QID positions. Wed, Apr 23 Newmont (NEM) Pre-market $0.84 $4.54 B Beat? Support miners; Miss? Short GDX or miners’ inverse. Wed, Apr 24 Apple (AAPL) After close $1.50 $94.0 B Beat? Trim SCC; Miss? Hedge with SCC or PSQ. Thu, Apr 25 Nvidia (NVDA) After close $4.50 $23.0 B Beat? Unwind NVDS/SOXS; Miss? Deploy QID or SOXS. Thu, Apr 25 Meta Platforms (META) After close $3.50 $36.5 B Beat? Roll off PSQ/SQQQ; Miss? Re-enter PSQ or QID. Thu, Apr 25 Amazon (AMZN) After close $0.80 $125 B AWS beat? Trim SDS/SPXS; Retail miss? Add SPXS or XRT bear ETF. Fri, Apr 26 Alphabet (GOOGL) Pre-market $1.50 $75 B Cloud/Ad beat? Lighten QID/SOXS; Miss? Dial up QID. Fri, Apr 26 Microsoft (MSF If the U.S. avoids a recession, the Magnificent Seven are poised for outsized profit growth in 2025. But even the strongest fundamentals can be shaken by market turbulence. By dynamically switching between Tickeron’s AI Double Agent strategies during VIX spikes and reverting to buy-and-hold when volatility subsides—and by tactically deploying inverse ETFs like QID to hedge downturns—you can both protect capital and ride the next leg of the Mag 7 rally.

Title: These 4 tech billionaires who attended or donated to Trump's inauguration lost $194 billion in his first 100 days
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-billionaires-wealth-dropped-trump-100-days-inauguration-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-04-29T08:15:01Z
Full Content:
It's been almost 100 days since President Donald Trump was sworn into office with some of the biggest names in tech near his side. Several tech billionaires cozied up to Trump ahead of his second term in part by attending the inauguration and donating to the inaugural fund. The appearance of a joint front stood in contrast to years of Trump criticizing Big Tech and calling out some tech leaders directly. A lot has changed since Inauguration Day. Tech leaders who supported Trump have seen both their net worths and the stock value of the companies they lead decline, as the administration's tariff-fueled trade war has coincided with a disruption in financial markets worldwide. Four of the richest tech billionaires who attended the inauguration or donated to it — Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jensen Huang — have lost a collective $193.6 billion since January 20, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Here's how much each tech billionaire has lost, according to Bloomberg's net worth estimates as of market close on Monday. Net worth on January 20: $449 billion Net worth on April 28: $335 billion Loss: $114 billion Musk, the tech billionaire who's gotten closer to Trump more than any other as an advisor, has seen the greatest decline in wealth, though he remains the world's richest person. Musk's work with the White House DOGE office led to swift backlash and a wave of protests against Tesla. The electric-vehicle maker has been struggling, with its stock price down nearly 25% this year. After Tesla reported lackluster quarterly earnings last week, Musk announced he would be stepping back from DOGE in May, spending just one or two days a week on government matters. He has consistently defended his work with the White House to eliminate waste and fraud in government. Net worth on January 20: $245 billion Net worth on April 28: $209 billion Loss: $36 billion Bezos's wealth, most of which is tied to stock in Amazon, the company he founded, has declined sharply since February. Analysts have said Amazon is especially at risk of being negatively impacted by Trump's trade war, including the 145% tariff on China, due to the number of products sold on the site, either directly or through third-parties, that come from the country. Some Amazon sellers have been raising prices on goods like appliances, snacks, and electronics, though the company has said it represents a small fraction of the total amount of goods sold on the site. Net worth on January 20: $217 billion Net worth on April 28: $195 billion Loss: $22 billion Zuckerberg may have had the worst relationship with Trump compared to any other tech billionaire prior to the election. Trump had repeatedly lashed out against the Meta CEO on Truth Social and suggested he should be investigated or jailed after Facebook temporarily banned Trump's account following the January 6 Capitol riot. Meta, the primary source of Zuckerberg's wealth, has been fighting an anti-trust lawsuit brought by the government that has not gone away under Trump. Zuckerberg earlier this month sat for three days of testimony after the antitrust trial opened. The Meta CEO testified for more than 10 hours and was grilled by the FTC's lead attorney. Net worth on January 20: $117 billion Net worth on April 28: $95.4 billion Loss: $21.6 billion While Huang did not attend the inauguration, Nvidia donated $1 million to the inaugural fund. Huang's wealth, a majority of which is tied to Nvidia stock, has also dropped since January, when he attended the inauguration. Nvidia stock has fallen over 21% year to date, with the company facing several setbacks that include Trump's tariffs, as the company sources a majority of its chips from overseas, primarily Taiwan. The company also said earlier this month it expected to take a $5.5 billion hit on its first-quarter earnings as a result of the Trump administration's restrictions on its chip exports to China. Other tech leaders who attended the inauguration saw declines in the stock prices of the companies they lead, including Tim Cook of Apple and Sundar Pichai of Google. Though some estimates suggest the CEOs are billionaires, they are not on Bloomberg's list of the top 500 richest people, so the change in their estimated net worth since the inauguration was not publicly available. But Apple's share price has fallen nearly 14% this year, while the share price of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has fallen nearly 15% this year. Jump to

Title: 'Steadiest ship in a brewing macro storm': Why Wall Street is bullish on Meta ahead of first-quarter earnings
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-platforms-q1-earnings-preview-wall-street-analyst-expectations-ai-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-04-29T08:00:02Z

Meta will report first-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the closing bell. Investors will be watching for key details on future AI spending. They'll also be looking for any commentary around how President Donald Trump's tariffs will impact advertising. Meta's stock was down 5% year-to-date through Tuesday's close, in line with the S&P 500's 5% slide. Wells Fargo said it expects Meta to be the "steadiest ship in a brewing macro storm," arguing that its dominance relative to other advertising platforms should shield it from some of the macroeconomic pain. "Checks indicate ad spend growth on Meta moderated throughout the qtr, but likely more resilient vs. other ad platforms against softer macro backdrop given minimal brand exposure," Wells Fargo said. The bank said Meta's Reels platform, which directly competes against TikTok, should have benefited from the uncertainty surrounding a potential TikTok ban earlier this year. "Checks suggest ad spend on TikTok shifted to Meta during the heightened uncertainty in Jan, with some budgets permanently moving to Reels," the bank said. Wells Fargo rates Meta Platforms at "Overweight" with a $752 price target. A major topic during Tesla's earnings call last week was blowback over Elon Musk's political involvement with the Trump administration. While Zuckerberg's ties to the White House aren't as deep as Musk's, he has been increasingly involved with Trump 2.0 — and investors could make it known whether they approve. Zuckerberg has had a contentious relationship with the president over the years; Trump once threatened the Meta CEO with life in prison. However, since the election, Zuck has seemed to try to smooth things over. Meta donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration and Zuckerberg was among the tech billionaires who got a front row seat to the swearing in This year, Meta partnered with the White House to bring the Easter Egg Roll. Despite macroeconomic concerns, JPMorgan said that Meta's strong execution and AI opportunities should help the company's results. "We believe META remains well-owned driven by strong execution & growing AI monetization," JPMorgan analysts wrote. "We're bullish on AI-driven Ad improvements, video unification, WhatsApp Ads, Llama, & Meta AI." The bank said it believes investors expect Meta Platforms' revenue to grow by about 13% year over year. Meeting or beating those expectations would likely boost the stock. It said that while macro factors are a concern, "tens of millions of advertisers should prove relative insulation." With regards to capex, JPMorgan expects the company to maintain its aggressive investment philosophy to capture the AI opportunity. "Our $108B 2025 GAAP expenses is below Meta's $114B-$119B guide as we expect META to rationalize expenses against lower growth," JPMorgan said. JPMorgan rates Meta Platforms at "Overweight" with a $610 price target. Investors will be watching closely to see if Meta's Reality Labs — its hardware and virtual reality division — is cutting back on its burn rate after racking up more than $50 billion in losses since 2020. The division, responsible for products like Quest headsets and smart glasses, was reorganized in January with key leaders now reporting directly to Meta's top brass. Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth has called 2025 "the most critical" year for Reality Labs, writing in an internal memo obtained by BI earlier this year that it could determine whether the effort is remembered as a visionary feat or a "legendary misadventure." He also stressed that Horizon Worlds on mobile must succeed for Meta's metaverse ambitions to stay afloat. Bosworth said Reality Labs grew sales 40% in 2024 and cited "massive" growth in wearables. But investors will want to see if those revenue gains are enough to begin narrowing the division's steep losses, which totaled $4.4 billion in Q3 of 2024 alone. Bank of America is leaning bullish on Meta heading into its coming earnings release. The bank said takeaways from Alphabet's comments on YouTube and its advertising checks should fuel a "modest beat" for Meta. Meta's workforce reductions in February and recent layoff announcements related to its Reality Labs division suggest that management is laser-focused on controlling operating expenses. "For expense guide, we would expect a trajectory toward the low end of the current $114-$119bn 2025 range," Bank of America said. The bank is also bullish on Meta's growing AI capabilities and its potential to unlock more advertising spending. "We think Meta's Al driven ad improvements still have several quarters to play out and for 2025 we see strong drivers of growth, including: 1) Expanding AI/ML ad capabilities, 2) Growing SFV usage aided by AI suggestions, 3) Growing messaging revenues, & 4) Monetization of untapped surfaces (Threads, Meta Al, Marketplace)," the bank said. SFV refers to "short form video." Bank of America rates Meta Platforms at "Buy" with a $640 price target. An elephant in the room is the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust trial against Meta. The company isn't expected to discuss the ongoing case during its earnings call, and the litigation isn't expected to have a significant impact on the results. The trial kicked off earlier this month, and Zuckerberg testified over three days. The FTC alleges that Meta, then Facebook, violated US antitrust laws when it bought Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 and WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014. Asked about Meta's acquisition of Instagram, Zuckerberg testified that he considered having Facebook build its own photo-sharing service, but ultimately, "I thought that Instagram was better at that, so I thought it was better to buy them." Meta's attorneys have argued that the company still faces competition from social media platforms including TikTok, YouTube, and X. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said Meta's Reels platform has the potential to drive significant growth for the company. "We still see a sizable opportunity for Reels to remain a key revenue growth tailwind for META in the coming years as the CPM gap closes further and as Reels continues to increase as a % of total ad impressions," Goldman Sachs said. On the spending front, the bank expects Meta to "somewhat pull back" on its planned investments due to macroeconomic headwinds. Goldman expects 2025 total GAAP expenses of about $110.5 billion, slightly below the company's guidance range of $114 billion to $119 billion. "For META, we see the key debates being how the company indicates a framework of balance between long-term investments and annualized operating costs if the macroeconomic environment impacts the business in the coming quarters," Goldman Sachs said. Goldman Sachs rates Meta Platforms at "Buy" with a $685 price target. First quarter Revenue estimate: $41.38 billion Operating income estimate: $15.52 billion Second quarter Full year 2025 Jump to

Title: Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. Reminds Investors That Class Action Lawsuits Have Been Filed Against AppLovin, Maravai, e.l.f. Beauty, and Skyworks Solutions and Encourages Investors to Contact the Firm

April 28, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, April 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP), Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRVI), e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE: ELF), and Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) Class Period: May 10, 2023 – March 26, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 The AppLovin class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period created the false impression that AppLovin’s enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform, in addition to its “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. In truth, AppLovin was exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices that forced unwanted apps on customers via a “backdoor installation scheme” which inaccurately inflated installation numbers, and, in turn, its profit figures, the complaint alleges. The AppLovin class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 26, 2025, analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures, the complaint alleges. On this news, the price of AppLovin shares fell by more than 12%, the AppLovin class action lawsuit alleges. For more information on the AppLovin class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/APP Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRVI) Class Period: August 7, 2024 - February 24, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 On February 25, 2025, before the market opened, Maravai announced it was postponing its fiscal 2024 earnings release and would delay filing its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. The Company had identified an error in revenue recognition that “resulted in approximately $3.9 million in revenue being recorded in the final week of the second quarter of 2024 upon shipment when it should have been recorded in the first week of the third quarter of 2024 upon receipt by the customer.” The Company had identified “a material weakness in its internal controls over revenue recognition.” Maravai also required additional time to “complete its assessment of a potential non-cash impairment charge related to goodwill associated with its previous acquisition of Alphazyme LLC.” On this news, the Company’s share price fell $0.87, or 21.70%, to close at $3.14 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Maravai lacked adequate internal controls over financial reporting related to revenue recognition; (2) as a result, the Company inaccurately recognized revenue on certain transactions during fiscal 2024; (3) its goodwill was overstated; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. For more information on the Maravai class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/MRVI e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE: ELF) Class Period: November 1, 2023 - November 19, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. To maintain investor confidence, e.l.f. Beauty inflated revenue and other financial measures over multiple quarters. The Company suffered from rising inventory levels. The Company falsely attributed its rising inventory to changes in sourcing. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about e.l.f. Beauty, investors suffered damages. For more information on the e.l.f. Beauty class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ELF Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) Class Period: August 8, 2023 - February 5, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Skyworks’ expected revenue for the fiscal year 2025. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Skyworks’ ability to expand its mobile business and capitalize on its growth potential by investing in new technologies to diversify its portfolio of offerings. On February 5, 2025, after market close, Skyworks announced its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and provided lower-than anticipated revenue guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed its results and low guidance to a “competitive landscape” that had “intensified” in recent years. Following this news, the price of Skyworks’ common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $87.08 per share on February 5, 2025, Skyworks’ stock price fell to $65.60 per share on February 6, 2025, a decline of over 24% in the span of just a single day.

Title: AppLovin (APP) Under Pressure: Analyst Downgrades Follow Short Seller Barrage, Investor Lawsuit – Hagens Berman

April 28, 2025 14:42 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP APP Investors with Losses Encouraged to Contact the Firm Before May 5th Deadline SAN FRANCISCO, April 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Just months after basking in the glow of a meteoric 700% stock surge, fueled by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence technology and burgeoning ad business, AppLovin Corp. (NASDAQ: APP) is facing a shift in sentiment on Wall Street. Several prominent investment banks have significantly lowered their expectations for the stock following the release of multiple critical reports from short-selling firms about the mobile advertising technology firm. Adding to its woes, AppLovin is now facing a securities class action lawsuit. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Analysts Downgrade APP Shares The latest blow came on Friday, April 11, when The Goldman Sachs Group slashed its price target for AppLovin from a lofty $500.00 to a more sobering $335.00. This downgrade followed a similar move by UBS Group earlier in the week, when the firm reduced its price target on AppLovin from $630.00 to $450.00. Short Seller Onslaught: Allegations of Data Exploitation and Inflated Metrics These downward revisions follow a barrage of critical reports from short sellers. Most recently, on March 28, Muddy Waters Research alleged that AppLovin's ad technology "systematically" violates app store rules by "impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs" from major platforms to deliver targeted ads without user consent. The report also claimed a significant churn rate among e-commerce advertisers, contradicting company statements. Earlier, in February, Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research had also critiqued AppLovin's AXON software, with Fuzzy Panda later urging the S&P 500 committee to exclude the company due to alleged "data theft" and "revenue fraud." Securities Class Action Alleges Misleading Statements Adding to AppLovin's challenges, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against the company. The lawsuit alleges that AppLovin misled investors about the capabilities of its enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and its "cutting-edge AI technologies." Specifically, the lawsuit claims that AppLovin created a false impression that its technology would efficiently match advertisements to mobile games and expand into web-based marketing and e-commerce. However, the suit alleges that AppLovin was instead exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices, including a "backdoor installation scheme," to force unwanted apps on customers. This allegedly inflated installation numbers and, consequently, the company's profit figures. The class action lawsuit further points to the short seller reports released on February 26, 2025, which detailed AppLovin's alleged reverse engineering and exploitation of advertising data from Meta Platforms. These reports also claimed that AppLovin utilized manipulative practices to artificially inflate ad click-through and app download rates, such as self-clicking ads and employing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads. Following the release of these reports, the price of AppLovin shares reportedly fell by more than 12%. Hagens Berman’s Investigation Prominent shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the claims. “The allegations detailed in the short reports and outlined in the recently filed class action complaint, detailing the purported exploitation of user data and manipulative installation schemes, raise serious questions about the integrity of AppLovin's reported growth and the accuracy of its disclosures to the investing public,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Title: Watch These Meta Stock Price Levels Ahead of Facebook Parent's Earnings
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/watch-these-meta-stock-price-levels-ahead-of-facebook-instagram-parent-earnings-11723050
Time Published: 2025-04-28T17:59:53Z
Full Content:
Meta (META) shares were holding steady Monday as the Facebook and Instagram parent prepares to report first-quarter results after Wednesday’s closing bell. Investors will be paying close attention to the social media giant's ad revenue outlook, amid concerns of a broader slowdown in digital advertising spending by Chinese companies as the U.S. and China impose lofty tariffs on one another. Legal and regulatory disputes have nagged Meta, with the E.U. recently fining the tech giant for violating its Digital Markets Act and an antitrust trial getting underway in the U.S. Coming into the week, Meta shares were down about 7% for so far in 2025, though they have outperformed their Magnificent Seven peers over the period, boosted by the company’s significant investment in AI driving advertising growth and user engagement across its suite of apps. The stock was down fractionally at around $547 in mid-afternoon trading Monday. Below, we take a closer look at Meta’s chart and use technical analysis to identify price levels that investors may be eyeing. Meta shares have forged two closely aligned troughs during April, potentially setting the stage for a double bottom, a chart pattern that indicates a bullish reversal. More recently, the stock has undergone a pre-earnings bounce, with the price forming a doji in Friday’s trading session to signal indecision among buyers and sellers. Meanwhile, the relative strength index (RSI) points to neutral conditions, providing a reading around the 50 threshold. Let’s identify several important support and resistance levels on Meta's chart. Investors should initially keep track of the $482 level. A pullback to this area would likely attract buying interest near the prominent April troughs that form the potential double bottom pattern. It’s worth pointing out that this location also sits in the same neighborhood as the 38.2% Fibonacci retirement level when applying a grid from the February high to April low. Selling below this key level could see the shares retreat to around $452. This area may provide support near swing lows that developed on retracements toward the 200-day moving average in July and August last year. A pre-earnings bump could trigger buying to the $588 level. Investors may view this area as a high probability location to lock in profits near a trendline that links the early-April countertrend rally with a series of corresponding trading activity on the chart stretching back to December last year. Finally, a close above this level would confirm the double bottom pattern and potentially spark a move up to $632. Meta shares may run into overhead selling pressure in this region near multiple peaks that formed on the chart between December and March.

Title: What’s The Vibe In The U.S. Tech Sector
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2025/04/28/whats-the-vibe-in-the-us-tech-sector/
Time Published: 2025-04-28T16:36:37Z

ByJack Kelly ByJack Kelly, Senior Contributor. Female data scientist is using a digital tablet with graphical electronic circuit projection The U.S. tech sector is contending with a combination of innovation along with job instability. The vibe is resilient, but anxious. A U.S. News survey shows 80% of tech workers report job satisfaction. They cite high pay and impact, but posts on the X platform reveal growing pessimism, with 65% of tech workers surveyed by The Information expecting worse conditions, driven by layoffs and hiring pullbacks. Drawing on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Forbes, Layoffs.fyi, and executive search firm Robert Half, alongside sentiment from the vocal X platform, here’s a snapshot of the tech sector’s pulse. This includes the range of what’s happening in the job market to dream employers and the daily grind. The BLS projects 356,700 annual tech job openings through 2033, signaling growth, especially in AI and fintech, where financial services now attract 22% of Cornell’s computer science graduates, up from 16% in 2022. US tech professionals are drawn to companies like NVIDIA, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Salesforce, Adobe, and Netflix for their innovation, competitive pay, and supportive cultures. These employers offer the chance to work on transformative technologies, grow professionally, and enjoy flexible, inclusive workplaces. Tech workers rank companies like Oracle, Amazon, and FIS Global highly, per Forbes’ 2024 Best Employers for Tech Workers, based on about 25,000 surveyed employees. Oracle’s supportive culture and Amazon’s mentorship programs shine, offering competitive pay, $142,000–$210,000 along with generous bonuses, stock options, and growth. Robert Half’s 2025 Salary Guide notes only 41% of tech workers are satisfied with pay, averaging $112,521, though AI-skilled professionals earn a 17.7% premium. A Dice report highlights 47% of tech workers are actively seeking new roles, driven by underpayment or lack of flexibility. Layoffs make job searches tougher. Still, over 7 million job postings in 2025, a 33% jump, per Dice, show opportunities persist for skilled candidates. AI engineering roles are emerging as the top hiring priority. U.S. tech managers are hiring for AI engineer positions. This surge in AI-focused recruitment is complemented by a growing need for full-stack engineers, who play a crucial role in building AI systems. The most sought-after jobs include AI engineers, cloud architects, and cybersecurity analysts. AI engineers, leveraging Python and TensorFlow, earn $150,000–$300,000 plus bonuses and stock, per Glassdoor. Cloud architects average $148,821, and cybersecurity analysts, vital amid digital threats, earn $120,000–$200,000, according to Robert Half. Work-from-home policies are shrinking. Robert Half finds only 18% of 2025 tech roles are fully remote, clashing with 46% of workers unwilling to return onsite full-time. Hybrid models dominate, with companies offering commute perks to lure workers back, per Crunchbase. This shift frustrates many, as flexibility remains a top priority, per Harvey Nash’s 2024 report. Life as a tech worker is dynamic but demanding. Many juggle upskilling in AI or cloud computing, with 87% of hiring leaders valuing AI experience, per ResumeTemplates.com. Long hours, especially in startups, contrast with perks like mental wellness support at firms like CoreWeave. However, the BLS projects 356,700 annual tech job openings through 2033, driven by AI and fintech growth. Financial services now attract 22% of Cornell’s computer science graduates, up from 16% in 2022, reflecting shifting priorities toward fintech innovation. The tech industry, heavily reliant on global supply chains, faces significant challenges from the 2025 tariffs. Companies like Apple, Amazon, and NVIDIA, which depend on manufacturing in China, Vietnam, and Taiwan, are grappling with increased costs for imported hardware, semiconductors, and consumer electronics. The Consumer Technology Association projects that tariffs could reduce U.S. consumer purchasing power by $90–143 billion, with potential declines in laptop and tablet purchases by up to 68% and smartphones by 37%. This drop in demand threatens revenue for hardware giants and e-commerce platforms, as seen in stock price drops. Business woman working in an incredible futuristic and original office space, looking at her phone, ... More worried about layoffs The tech industry faced significant workforce reductions, with Layoffs.fyi reporting that 50,728 employees were let go across 111 tech companies. This wave of layoffs, while less intense than the peak of 2023, reflects ongoing adjustments within the sector as companies navigate economic shifts, technological advancements, and strategic realignments. Among the companies leading these layoffs, Intel stands out with its announcement to cut approximately 22,000 jobs, representing 20% of its workforce. This move, the largest tech layoff of the year, underscores the challenges faced by the semiconductor industry. Meta followed with a reduction of 3,600 workers, roughly 5% of its staff, framing the cuts as a push to enhance productivity and eliminate underperforming roles. STMicro, another player in the electronics and semiconductor space, laid off 3,000 employees, grappling with market headwinds. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) trimmed 2,500 jobs, about 5% of its workforce, after a 19% drop in its stock price in the first quarter of 2025. Workday, a software firm, reduced its headcount by 1,750, or 8.5%, to redirect resources toward artificial intelligence initiatives. Microsoft also contributed to the trend, eliminating 2,280 roles across divisions like cloud services and mixed reality as part of performance-driven restructuring. The rise of artificial intelligence and automation has reshaped priorities. Firms are channeling significant investments into AI development, automating tasks previously handled by human workers. This shift has rendered roles in areas like software engineering, human resources, and support teams redundant, as evidenced by cuts at Stack Overflow and Salesforce. Despite robust profits at some tech giants, high interest rates, inflation, and investor demands for leaner operations have pushed companies to prioritize cost-cutting. Meta and Microsoft, for instance, have used layoffs to bolster stock prices and strengthen their financial positions. Many firms are restructuring to focus on high-growth areas such as AI and cybersecurity, as seen in Cisco’s strategic pivot away from less profitable segments. A concerning dynamic is at play. Once one or two top tier tech companies announce layoffs, it follows up with a copycat effect where companies also start laying off people too.

Title: Fired FTC commissioners on fighting for their jobs back

Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Slaughter want to take their fight to the Supreme Court, and they think they can win. by Nilay Patel Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Slaughter want to take their fight to the Supreme Court, and they think they can win. by Nilay Patel Today, we have something special for you: A few days ago, I hosted a panel with FTC commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya at the IAPP Global Privacy Summit in Washington, DC. We recorded the discussion, and we’re bringing it to you today. That’s all pretty normal Decoder stuff, you might say — except these are anything but normal circumstances. Right off the bat, you’ll hear me even struggle to introduce them. Becca and Alvaro were FTC commissioners until very recently, when President Donald Trump fired them. The thing is, he doesn’t appear to have any legal authority to actually do that. As you’ll hear them discuss, by law the FTC needs to have commissioners from both political parties. Additionally, there’s a 90-year-old Supreme Court precedent that explicitly says the President can’t fire FTC commissioners in this way. So, given all that, they’re suing the administration to get their jobs back — and as you’ll hear, they are both committed to taking this case all the way to the Supreme Court. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! That puts them in a deeply weird, Schrödinger’s cat kind of position, for now: they both are and are not currently working as FTC commissioners, and that creates some strange tensions you’ll hear us get into. On top of all that, of course, there’s the actual work of the FTC going on. The antitrust trial against Meta was going on basically down the street from where I sat talking with Rebecca and Alvaro, so I spent some time asking how that case was going — and why Mark Zuckerberg’s donations to the inauguration and frequent appearances in the Oval Office haven’t seemed to dissuade the government from trying to break up Meta. You’ll hear Becca in particular point out that being bad at bribes still means the government is open for bribery and corruption, and that creates all kinds of other problems for the economy. There’s a lot going on in this conversation, from how the president fires you to the attempt in Silicon Valley to build AI into a digital god. We also somehow ended up taking printer recommendations from the audience. It’s a good one. Okay: liminal FTC commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya. Here we go. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Hi everybody. I am Nilay Patel. I’m the editor-in-chief of The Verge and host of the Decoder podcast. I have two excellent guests with me today. I’m going to say former Federal Trade Commission chairs. Alvaro Bedoya: That’s up to you. That’s your call. We would politely disagree. Rebecca Slaughter: We would not say that. Current liminal FTC commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya. Welcome, thank you for being here. RS: Thanks for having us. I have a million questions for the both of you. Let’s start with the elephant in the room. Normally, in a conversation about privacy and consumer protection with FTC commissioners, it would be a fairly predictable set of topics, especially now with AI. It is not a predictable time in America. It is not a predictable set of circumstances. Let’s start with your status with President Donald Trump. He fired both of you. It appears to be illegal. Tell us how that happened. Did he call you? RS: He did not call us. I’ll start by noting that Donald Trump originally appointed me in 2018 to the FTC. I was appointed as a minority commissioner, a Democrat. The agency is, by statute, composed of bipartisan members. The statute says: five members, no more than three from any one party. I was appointed in 2018 as a minority commissioner. I served as a minority commissioner, and then I was briefly the acting chair at the beginning of the Biden administration. Then, I was a majority commissioner, along with Commissioner Bedoya, who joined us in 2022, then became a minority commissioner again in January 2025. On March 18, which was a Tuesday, I had finished a day at the office, meeting with a bunch of staff in the agency. Then, I was at my kid’s elementary school volunteering on a drama club project. We always joke that we like to keep the drama on the stage and out of our house, but no, the drama found us that day. I checked my email and I had an email from someone I’d never heard of in the Presidential Personnel Office with a message purportedly on behalf of Donald Trump announcing that I was terminated effective immediately. I stood up and I walked out of drama club to the courtyard, and I called Alvaro and I said, “Hey, have you checked your email?” And you can take the story over from there. AB: I was very proudly not checking my email because I’d just arrived at my daughter’s gymnastics class, and she gets really annoyed when she does a cool trick and I’m looking at my phone like an idiot. So, I got a call and I picked it up and Becca said, “Have you seen your email?” And I said, “Actually, I haven’t seen my email.” And she said, “You should check your email because I just got an email purporting to fire me.” Sure enough, that same email was in my inbox right there. Okay, I have a number of tech reporter questions. Did you receive a plain text email saying you had been terminated? I’m just imagining Donald Trump creating a PDF. That’s in my head. RS: No, that did not happen. There was no PDF, there was no signed letter, there was no signature. It was a text email. AB: There was no indication that there was any additional level of security associated with email. I’m just curious about the mechanics of how these decisions are made. RS: It literally felt like somebody typed an email in their Outlook and hit send. Very good, very on-brand. You guys are both in litigation against the Trump administration and Chairman Andrew Ferguson. They are in what appears to be a violation of a 90-year-old Supreme Court case called Humphrey’s Executor v. United States. I don’t think a district court is going to overturn that precedent. Are you prepared to go all the way to the Supreme Court on this one? RS: Absolutely. This is not a complicated case. There’s no dispute about the facts and there’s no dispute about what the law says. The law says, very explicitly, that commissioners can only be removed for neglect, malfeasance, or inefficiency, so what we generally call cause. You’ve got to do something wrong. The email purporting to fire us did not allege any cause, and I feel like it’s important to say that there is no cause. Neither of us have engaged in neglect, malfeasance, or inefficiency. Alvaro is one of the hardest working people in not just Washington but the country, andI try to follow close behind him. There is no cause. The statute says we can only be removed for cause. That statute was passed 111 years ago and 92 years ago was the last time a president tried to remove an FTC commissioner. FDR tried to fire Commissioner William Humphrey also for no cause. He sued, challenging his removal, and then he died before the case was settled, which is why this famous case is called “Humphrey’s Executor.” His estate pursued the lawsuit, and it went all the way up to the Supreme Court. The unanimous Supreme Court said, “Yes, that statute says commissioners can only be removed for cause. And yes, that statute is constitutional.” That precedent has been undisturbed, unchanged, unchallenged… well, it’s been challenged but not effectively for 90 years. So yes, I would be shocked if a district court judge decided to unilaterally overturn 90 years of Supreme Court precedent. And yes, I think we are very prepared for this to be a case that is litigated up to the Supreme Court. Indeed, I think that’s what the administration is trying to do. They are unsubtly trying to challenge this 90-year-old precedent under the theory that the president should be able to fire whomever he wants. They argue that that is necessary for Democratic accountability. I find that argument a little ironic because I think what bipartisan commissions provide is accountability and transparency, even while allowing the president to execute his agenda by naming the chair and having the majority of the commission. There are lots of legal nuances, but it’s not a close case. There is the unitary executive theory. In many ways, the Supreme Court has pursued that theory over the course of all of their individual careers. It does feel like maybe they want to overturn another precedent. They’re on a spree of overturning, although I’m not sure I learned anything in law school. RS: Nothing we learned in law school remains relevant. It’s a fair point. Right. It’s gone. What is a tort? Let’s find out. It’s a real situation. Do you think you have a good chance with this court? AB: I think we do. RS: There’s more nuance there. AB: I think it is very important for people to realize that in a sense, this is about Commissioner Slaughter and I, and our continued service on the commission. In another arguably much more important sense, it is about a commission being able to serve without fear of favor, especially independent institutions like our own. And if the president can remove Commissioner Slaughter and I for no reason at any time, he can do the same to Jerome Powell at the Federal Reserve. He can do the same for commissioners at the Securities and Exchange Commission. He has done the same at the National Credit Union Administration. He could do the same at the FDIC. These are bedrock institutions of our financial life. So this is about privacy to a degree and about cybersecurity. But this is also about your retirement account, your checking account. Will those things that you hold quite dear be subject to the same stable regulatory and enforcement environment that is provided in a world where the leaders of these institutions are protected by for-cause removal productions? RS: I think it goes even further than that because these institutions also include the FCC, the SEC, the CFTC, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, and a whole panoply of institutions that have been built up over the last 100 years by Congress explicitly to be bipartisan. If they effectively challenge removal protections, then what meaning do the appointment requirements have? Then, can these institutions even continue to exist because they would be so divorced from what Congress designed and built. I think understanding that the stability point that Commissioner Bedoya is talking about goes beyond if you’re going to have wild swings in policy at these agencies from administration to administration. It goes much deeper into whether these agencies can even exist. Can markets rely on the stability that they provide?” Are you taking anything from the chaos around Trump threatening Powell and walking it back as the market reacted? RS: What we are seeing is exactly what we’ve been saying, which is that he thinks he can fire whomever he wants. That he chooses not to doesn’t create stability. We are still in the same position of instability and uncertainty with these wild fluctuations that markets have been reacting to. I guess it’s good that he’s responding to market panic, but I would prefer not to panic the markets by following the laws that Congress passed and what our Constitutions says. There’s another piece of this, which is that the FTC continues to operate. It’s in court right now against Meta, and it filed a case against Uber. Chair Ferguson told our reporter Lauren Feiner at a conference that he has to “obey lawful orders,” and that he will pull those cases if the president asks him. But he would be surprised if the president asked him to stop prosecuting Meta or anyone else. Do you think that’s a viable position? Is he saying what he has to say? Is he managing Donald Trump? Is that what he really believes? AB: Let’s add a little meat to that bone, okay? Let’s just add some words to what you described. You have the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission say, “I think this trial is important. I think we are in the right in suing Meta. I think the law is on our side.” He said early on in his tenure, to his great credit, “I want to keep on going with this lawsuit.” You have a law enforcement official making that statement. You also have a law enforcement official saying at the same time, “But if the president gives me an order to drop that lawsuit, I shall do so.” Who is being served by that world? Is competition being served by that world? Are startups being served by that world? Who is helped by that scenario? The other thing that’s very important to underscore is that just because he has not been fired does not mean he is not being influenced. Just because the people haven’t been fired doesn’t mean that they haven’t changed their behavior as a result of a very clear commandment: if you obey, you will stay, and if you don’t, you won’t. Every single person serving in government will tell you that that’s what’s happening right now. So for me, I look at that and I don’t see law enforcement or the mission of the Federal Trade Commission being served by that in the slightest. It is notable that Mark Zuckerberg paid a bunch of money to build a library. He was on stage at the inauguration. He was in the Oval Office in the run-up to the Meta trial. But then he was on the stand giving testimony, and [Instagram co-founder] Kevin Systrom was on the stand. Why do you think that happened? Was is just not effective? Do you think Trump doesn’t like the bling? AB: Look… wait Trump what? He doesn’t like the bling. RS: He likes the bling. Trump is more of a classic necktie guy and [Zuckerberg has shown up with Caesar shirts. AB: I shall not speculate on that point. Let’s just talk about the meeting. In any recent Republican or Democratic administration, a megadonor visiting not just the White House but the Oval Office to meet with the president after having donated $1 dollars to the inauguration to ask for a law enforcement action to be dropped against them would be front-page news for days. It would be considered wildly inappropriate, and it would be considered antithetical to the mission that the commission was charged with doing. I don’t really care what happens after that. The simple fact of that meeting being observed and noted by everyone serving in these positions of leadership– RS: I’m going to put it a little bit more bluntly. AB: Please. RS: Bribery is bad even if it doesn’t work. Bribery is a problem even if it isn’t effective. We have a system of laws based on the idea that you prevail if the facts and the law are on your side and not because you tried to bribe anyone in the system. If we do not resist even efforts at bribery with every fiber of our being, we are doing an enormous disservice to the rule of law, administration of justice, and the operation of our democracy. I mean, genuinely and fundamentally, I think it’s that serious. So bribery is bad even if it doesn’t work. Let me push on that just a little bit. Do all these guys just suck at bribery? Because they’re all in there. The Meta case is going, Google is losing its cases. AB: Let’s talk about another gentleman who was on the stage at the inauguration, Mr. Bezos. Mr. Bezos gave $1 million dollars to the inaugural fund. His company cut a deal that would benefit the first lady to the tune of $29 million, according to the New York Post. His company separately licensed the rights to The Apprentice, which as you might imagine didn’t cost a small amount. Subsequent to most of these things, the new [Occupational Safety and Health Administration nominee] in the United States was a former Amazon executive. This is a company that has, according to numerous studies, an injury rate two times higher vis-à-vis other large warehouses. This is a company that has so many injuries on the warehouse floor that the vending machines there dispense painkillers. This is a company that, according to a Senate investigation, was denying outside referrals to medical care of its own warehouse employees for up to 21 days allegedly as a matter of policy. After you flow in a minimum of $30 million-plus dollars into those coffers, I think having the nation’s leading workplace safety law enforcer be a former executive of your company is astounding. So, I don’t know if these donations are not working, necessarily. RS: I also think that if bribery doesn’t work, the reason is because the bribee says, “No thanks. I don’t do bribes.” If they say, “Cool, give me your dollars,” and then you don’t get what you want, your message is to give more dollars, right? That’s what I think we expect to see. To Commissioner Bedoya’s point, Amazon is also in not one but two active litigations with the FTC right now and is under order for a number of other things. In one of those cases, we saw an FTC attorney go into court and say, “Because of the DOGE cuts and resource constraints, we’re going to have to delay this trial.” Now, Chair Ferguson had him walk that back very quickly, but nothing that attorney said in that courtroom was wrong, right? It was all true in terms of the resource constraints that the agency is facing and the effect that has on active cases and investigations. Is it direct influence? I don’t know. I am not in the minds of the influencers here, but I think it’s all stuff that should make us pay very close attention and be very concerned. Let me ask about the Amazon case specifically. I think of the Amazon case, and I instinctively think of Lina Khan. She came to prominence writing “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox.” She became the chair of the FTC. She was a flash rod of controversy. Ferguson got his job by insisting that he would throw out all of her ideas. He hasn’t though, right? He’s kept the merger guidelines, and he’s stayed in litigation against these companies. The Amazon case is the hard one. That’s the one where we might actually litigate the consumer welfare standard and, win or lose, change that precedent. Do you think that one is at the most risk or is it the Meta case? Because I associate the Amazon litigation with Chair Khan so directly that it feels like it would be the first one to go. RS: It’s hard for us to know what’s at the most risk. I see big, flashing, red danger signs all over the agency’s agenda right now. I think that case is important. Chair Khan wrote a piece, a very influential piece, about Amazon, but that is not what that case ended up being about. I actually really think everybody should read that case because what that case says — Commissioner Bedoya and I both supported that case, and I think we’re very proud to do so — was that you might associate Amazon with lower prices in your mind. But actually, the evidence shows that its conduct was raising prices not only on its own platform but across the internet, hurting not only consumers but also the sellers. So, it was exercising monopoly power in both directions. I think it reads much more like a traditional antitrust case than many people might have expected it to. We’ll see what happens in litigation if it gets to litigation and if it’s properly resourced. It’s very, very hard to know what’s actually happening behind the scenes if you’re not on the case team. So we’ll see. What everybody should want is the confidence that the law is being administered without fear or favor and not with thoughts about whose donors are going to be mad or when the phone might ring and ask you to totally change direction. That’s just bad. You can think the FTC is right or that the FTC is wrong, but you should want that case to be litigated on the merits. Period. Full stop. AB: Let me also speak to something else you said Nilay. I say this to someone who’s lived in D.C. for I think 17 years or 16 years. I think Chair Kahn was controversial in Aspen, Davos, and Sun Valley. You go and talk to a rural grocer in Utah. You go and talk to the urban grocer in North Tulsa. You go talk to corn growers and cattlemen in Iowa about the work she led and that we worked with her on. It is the opposite of controversial. The response you get is, “What took you guys so long? Thank god. Where have you been all this time? I’m so glad you’re doing this.” I get the same news sources. I’m not saying it’s coming from The Verge, but you get rained on by all this press that is focused on the stock market and Wall Street, saying all sorts of things. Half my family lives in Louisiana now. You go talk to them about the work we did. It’s a whole lot of nodding and a whole lot of support. So, I think there’s a certain picture of Chair Khan that’s been painted that’s true in very specific circles of this country. That’s the first thing. Let’s talk about that Amazon case and what it’s about because I think some of the details get lost in this big title, “Amazon.” This is what we allege in that complaint. Number one, we alleged Amazon is a monopolist in that online retail market. We allege it has so much market power that if you’re a small retailer or a small seller, you need to be on Amazon. So once it has you, we allege it slowly started jacking up the price of selling your goods on Amazon, so much so that eventually, almost 50 cents of every dollar you made on that site had to go to Amazon. So what happens? Find me a small seller who can afford to have a 50 percent haircut on every dollar they sell. So people start saying, “Oh wait, I can sell for lower off the site and make a bigger margin because I’m not taking a 50 percent haircut on every sale I make on that site.” So, we allege that when those small sellers moved off the site to sell for 10, 20, 30 percent less, that Amazon used a surveillance system to find those people who were [whispers] lowering their prices and penalize them by knocking them out of the preferred placement on the platform. You say, “It turned the consumer welfare standard on its head.” I think consumers are hurt by this, and that is emphatically part of the argument that’s being made here. I also think small sellers are hurt by this, but this is something that hurt people who wanted to pay less, and it was hurting the small retailers as well. All right, I promise not to do another 20 minutes on hipster antitrust in this room. I can do it. AB: No, no, no, we’re ready for it. Let’s talk about Meta, which is indeed on the cutting edge of privacy in exciting ways. It’s at trial right now. That case was filed in 2020 under the first Trump administration. It was dismissed in 2021 under Biden and refiled. It’s back now. The heart of that case, to me, is an extraordinarily complicated market definition: personal networking services. There’s no one in that category except Snap and a thing called MeWe. How did we get there? It feels like what Meta is really keying on is being nonsensical. RS: You’re doing hipster antitrust again. We’re back in it. Look at me. RS: Look, all antitrust cases are about market definition to a degree, and it’s a very tortured thing that makes people hate lawyers, honestly. The concept of antitrust law is very simple. The administration of it gets very complicated. So yes, most antitrust cases are about market definition, and market definition is always hard. Everybody has a different view about what the right way to define a market is that gets litigated. What that case is really about is whether Meta bought competitors to eliminate the risk of competition. That’s the argument at the end of the day. Did it not want to compete on its merits but instead take out potential competition through acquisition in order to build and maintain a monopoly in a way that’s illegal? That’s what’s going to get litigated. But it’s not a lot more complicated than that, even if there’s going to be hours of debate around what an appropriate market definition is. The reason I ask about that in this context is because Kevin Systrom is on the stand right now just dunking all over his acquirer. By the way, if all of us can have the confidence to sell our companies for a billion dollars, show up seven years later and say, “That sucked,” that’d be great for all of our self-esteem. It’s clear he didn’t like it. He’s saying very loudly they wanted to smother Instagram. That’s how he felt when he was running Instagram as part of Meta. But it still feels like Instagram got huge anyway and had Instagram been a separate company, I’m not sure it would’ve competed on a better privacy policy, or less personalized advertising. Kevin Systrom showing up on SuperLive being like, “I’m not listening to you,” does not feel like a likely outcome of Instagram being an independent company. I’m wondering, as you think about this landscape and all of the problems with consumer protection, what competition solves there and what do you need a regulatory regime to actually solve? RS: That’s a really good question. I think the point that you’re making about what the counterfactual looks like is the hard question anti-trust agencies grapple with every time they’re faced with a merger. Every time you have to review a merger, the question is, “What happens if this company gets acquired and what happens if it doesn’t?” You have to make predictions about what will happen in the market, and that’s hard. That’s a hard thing to do. That’s okay, we can do hard things. I think that the counterfactual is hard to do here. That’s true everywhere, and it’s just impossible to know, honestly. So the question is, “Did [Meta] do the acquisition to eliminate this risk of competition?” more than what the counterfactual universe of [an independent] Instagram looks like. The question that you asked about why this matters for privacy and why it matters for consumer protection is a really, really important one. Not for nothing, but Meta is also under order with the FTC for privacy violations, a renewed order that was issued in 2019 — from which I dissented — for which it paid $5 billion, and it’s currently in an administrative proceeding at the FTC over whether or not that order should be modified because there are further questions about privacy practices, including ones involving children. One of the reasons competition matters, and one of the reasons I think you see so many consumer protection cases against companies where we also have competition concerns, is because without meaningful competition and the ability for customers to vote with their feet and take their business to companies with better products that are less violative, you have an incentive to commit these violations, including to build market share. I’ll go back to an Amazon example. One of the orders that Amazon is under with the FTC right now involves Amazon Alexa devices’ illegal collection and retention of children’s voice recording info. Why did it do this collection of children’s voice data? It was in order to train its AI. So that’s, to me, a very clear example of a consumer protection violation that was orchestrated to build market share and market power. Going back to why you should care about us or our jobs — I mean, maybe you don’t care about our jobs — and why you should care about the institution existing is because it does have this cross-jurisdictional lens where it can look at competition and consumer protection. I will say, we haven’t done that very well historically. I think we have really treated these issues as siloed, but over the time I’ve been at the agency, we’ve been working really hard to integrate those functions better and understand the actual market dynamics that are leading to the kinds of problems we’re seeing both in competition and consumer protection. Let me push that again. If this case is successful and the government succeeds in spinning off Instagram and WhatsApp, do you think there’ll be a meaningful benefit to how consumers experience privacy on these platforms? RS: One would hope. One of the things that’s very frustrating about antitrust law is that ex-post enforcement is long, slow, and takes forever, and it’s very difficult to fix problems once they’ve started. One of the important purposes of bringing these cases is to prevent the next round of problems and to send clear signals to the market about the kinds of transactions that are illegal and should not happen to begin with. Yes, I would love to see healthy thriving competition with social media platforms, but I would also like to see that competition continue with new entrants, new innovation, and organic growth that isn’t just orchestrated through acquisition. Do you think anything short of a breakup would be effective there? Like a long compliance regime? RS: I’ve been talking a lot. You talk. AB: No, I think you are most familiar with the case having voted it out. We’re answering a lot of questions about a case that right now is in trial, and so I don’t feel particularly eager to expound even more on it myself. You know what you’re talking about, so you should. RS: I’ll talk generally about remedies. Everybody talks about what we call “structural remedies,” breakups as this radical approach. I find that very confusing. I actually think structural remedies are a much more small-c conservative approach because they keep the government out of the business and have the businesses operating independently. My impression over the time I’ve been at the FTC has been that complicated compliance regimes are very difficult to administer, less likely to be effective, and can, in fact, interfere with the free market operation of companies. That’s a weird thing for a Democrat to say, right? I generally like government. I think it can and should be a force for good. But I do think that administrability is a real concern in what we call “behavioral remedies.” Going back to the privacy focus, we’ve seen a lot of that concern in privacy remedies where we have complicated compliance regimes. Figuring out if they’re actually working and fixing the problem is not always that easy or clear. I want to ask one more question about privacy as a general concept and then I want to end with some AI questions. There are a lot of reasons to feel nihilism in 2025 in America. One that I get from our audience at The Verge all the time is that privacy is just lost, that it’s over. Everyone is listening to us all the time. The data has been scraped, it’s gone. Apple should just give in and make a better AI system by scraping everyone’s data, and that it won’t do it is holding it back. You can’t put this genie back in the bottle. I hear this from our audience all the time. Then, I see things that I find very amusing in a dark way, like everybody on Instagram posting a screenshot saying, “I command Mark Zuckerberg to not take my data” like an incantation, and it’s great. I look at that as the clearest market signal anyone can ever get. Everyone on my platform says, “I hate you,” but they can’t go anywhere and the terms of service do not change. They do not get renegotiated in the face of that. That is where the regulator should come in and say, “Everyone wants you to change your terms of service.” Do you think it’s just litigation that gets this done? Do you think that there is an ability through regulation to put this genie back in a bottle? RS: I have said for a long time that Congress should pass a more specific privacy law. My own views about the contours of that law and what it should look like have evolved. When Congress started talking about it looked a little bit more like a notice and consent regime, and we all think that’s a terrible idea. We do not need more cookie banners. I think a minimization-focused regulatory approach would make a lot more sense. In fact, Congress got pretty close last year. Commissioner Bedoya and I both worked on the Hill. My experience of the legislative process is that it is absolutely torturous and everything is impossible until it’s a law. It’s never going to happen, and then it’s a law. So that fight needs to continue. I think the best evidence that people actually really do care about privacy comes from the data out of Apple’s “ask not to track” system. I can’t remember what the numbers are, but the number of people who, when given the option to track or not to track, choose, “Please ask the app not to track” is overwhelming. That is a clear market signal that people actually would prefer, given the option, not to have their data shared. Where the trade-offs come up in that, like if they’re willing to get a free service in exchange for sharing data, are personal and complicated. But as a general approach, even though I think people sometimes feel like it’s a lost cause, they don’t want it to be. We have agency and we can work to change that process. AB: I agree with everything Becca just said. I would add these thoughts. The first is that we haven’t lived in a world in recent memory where people have experienced what it’s like to have a meaningful online life with privacy. We’ve lived in a world where you’ve got a bucket with nine holes in it and a bucket with 10 holes, and both of those buckets suck. No one wants a leaky bucket, and so it’s hard to get excited about the bucket with nine holes in it as opposed to the one with 10 holes. I don’t think we’ve really lived in a world where we can say that people don’t care because I don’t think they’ve ever experienced it. That said, I would point to two things that show me that people are changing their behaviors in response to what they perceive as the threat to their privacy. First of all, I have no idea how old you are, Nilay, but I know that Commissioner Slaughter and I are roughly the same age. You remember when we were in law school? The stuff people would put on Facebook was crazy. People would put everything up there. Now, you go up there, there’ll be one thing about politics, one post like, “Hey guys, I’m going to go for a long ride. What should I play for the kids in the back?” People are much more guarded on social media now than they were before. Secondly, look at the uptake in encrypted messaging apps like Signal and WhatsApp, especially in Washington, D.C. Signal is very popular here from what I’m told. AB: Quite prevalent, but it’s not just in Washington D.C. RS: And not just for war plans. AB: Exactly. You see a lot of people in business using Signal by default, and not just in areas where there might be some actual commercial espionage, so to speak. So, I do think you see very clear indications that people care about their privacy even though they’re living in that world of leaky buckets. RS: I’m being a little flippant and making jokes, but I think we’re also in a moment where privacy has very real serious implications for people’s safety, security, access to healthcare, religious worship, political activity, all of these things. We’re seeing very real, very scary consequences happening to real humans who are not able to operate with privacy, and that’s something that is going to change behavior, too. That is connected to this administration and its attitude towards data, to Elon Musk and DOGE. Do you think this administration is positioned to advocate for privacy while they are interlinking databases and using AI tools to surveil Americans? RS: No. AB: No. I guess that’s the answer. I was hoping that you both would say that. RS: I can’t tell if you’re baiting us, but it’s just a no. I’m baiting but in a fun way. My friend Casey Newton has this phrase he uses called the “Splinternet.” He says the internet is going to fragment, not for technical reasons but for political and social reasons. What I see is that we’re about to build a very different kind of internet in the United States that has much fewer privacy protections while Europe begins to regulate tech platforms much more strongly. It issued fines just recently against Apple and Meta. That’s the sort of thing that breaks down data sharing across our different internets, across our different platforms. How do you see that playing out? Do you think we can put that genie back in the bottle and make it possible for European governments to trust our companies? AB: Sorry, what genie again? If our government starts allowing widespread data sharing within itself and stops advocating for privacy, stops pursuing a privacy law, or lets platforms share data more openly, which it appears to be doing. AB: Let me speak very frankly here. What this administration is doing in terms of data sharing is a direct heir of everything that President Biden did, everything President Trump did in his first presidency, everything that President Obama did. In terms of law enforcement sharing information within the federal government, it has been an upwards trajectory arrow with every single administration. It is not like this administration with immigration enforcement, for example, is building a system that was previously non-existent from scratch. That is the opposite of what’s happened. These systems have been ready for many, many, years. I candidly don’t think that the data sharing that’s being discussed today is radically different from the data sharing the federal government enacted prior to this administration. There’s a lot of other areas in which I disagree, but I think we need to be fair about this and the trajectory that intra-US data sharing has taken in recent years. RS: I’ll push back on that a little bit because I think there is a substantial difference. At least in the previous administrations, there was support for independent oversight of some of that data use and sharing, such as the existence of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) and the checks on national security surveillance. That independent oversight, including at the FTC, has been part of what supported adequacy decisions in Europe and the ability of US companies to process the data of Europeans. I do think we’re headed into a direction where that is going to be challenged, and it’s hard for me to see how those challenges are not effective. Who suffers when that happens? Who suffers if we have a different European internet? Humans, people who want to use the internet and communicate with each other suffer. That’s a problem. But also American businesses suffer. When I was working on the Hill, the biggest lobbying that we got over what was then the umbrella agreement was from US companies who wanted to be able to do business in Europe. Sure, the threats to cut off US companies from European market access will penalize Europeans, but it will really penalize US business. That is a profitable market for them, and that’s going to be a problem that I expect they will not be quiet about. I think we’re headed in that direction. Fundamentally, there’s a big difference because privacy is a legal value in Europe in a way that it is not in the US. It’s not enshrined in the same way in our Constitution here. There’s always been this differential view. How it plays out in practice is going to be the subject of a lot of debate, discussion, parliamentary debate and discussion, litigation debate and discussion, and I don’t think it’s going to get resolved anytime soon. One or two more questions about AI. AI companies make a lot of promises. They’re building digital god, they will replace your doctor– AB: Sorry, did you say digital what? Digital god. AB: Digital god. Got it. It’s just a phrase that I get to hear in my job. Totally normal. AB: That’s awesome. I run a magazine about cell phones. Super normal thing for me to hear all the time. An AI executive literally told me last night there would not be doctors and lawyers in the future because AI could just do it. This is the claim level that I hear on the regular from these companies. I don’t think they can do it. Maybe they can, maybe they can’t. It seems like they’re going to make a lot of people a lot of promises about the efficacy of their products. How would you address that in the trade context? AB: Let me address it in the regular human context. That is idiocy, the idea that there will be no doctors in the future. How long have we had printers? Forty years? How well does your printer work? You’re going to let an AI doctor diagnose you for life or death matters, let alone a wart? I think this idea is inane and should not be treated with any degree of respect. I have been shocked by some of the things that these AI execs get away with saying. Someone who runs a company that is valued at something like half a trillion dollars should not be able to say that sentience will be an emergent property in the near future. That is something that anyone who’s familiar with the technology does not think is a serious take unless there are other things going on. Have you ever been to a chili cook-off and a guy arrives like, “I don’t know what’s going to happen here! Could get pretty crazy with my chili!” These claims are what lawyers would call puffery and need to be treated as such. RS: It’s also nothing new, right? For a century, the work of the Federal Trade Commission has been to police misleading claims about what products can do. We do it with so-called medicinal products, dietary supplements, and technology products. This is not new. One of the things that Commissioner Bedoya, Chair Khan, and I have been saying for years now is there is no AI exception to the law. It doesn’t create special rules for AI. We apply the same rules, which are that you can’t misrepresent what your product can do. You can’t lie about it and can’t commit deceptive or unfair acts or practices. That’s true with AI products, too. Out of the body of work that the FTC has brought around AI in the last several years, some of it has been with an eye towards competition so that there is healthy competition in this, I think, incredibly important and valuable technological tool that is not the same as replacing doctors. But a lot of it has also been about misleading claims, business opportunity scams, people saying they’re get-rich-quick schemes, and it’s all the same sort of thing we’ve seen with every other technological iteration over the last 100 years. I think it’s important to take a step back and see through what is new, interesting, different, innovative, or a valuable tool, and what is just the same stuff we’ve been seeing for decades. I would say very few people thought their laser printer was alive, which is a meaningful difference that comes up over and over again. AB: The point is how well does your printer work? Does your printer work awesome? I write a printer recommendation every year. I’ll send you some. AB: Please, please. This is a real thing. AB: Raise your hand if your printer works awesome. This guy right here. AB: Yeah, thank you. One hand, two hands. I’m not going to endorse products. AB: Seriously raise your hand if your printer is awesome. Two hands. What’s that? What printer?Yeah, see? He knows. AB: Brother laser printer. Take the recommendation otherwise because the other 98% of the room does not think their printer is awesome. There’s affiliate links on theverge.com. The promo code is printer. RS: I think your point is that generative AI is messing with people’s brains because it looks human and it’s not human. Are we confused about how to deal with this technology? That is very true. Understanding how to relate to technology and how to process what’s real and not real is a challenge for people. I remember when AirPods first came out, and you’d see people walking down the street talking to themselves, and everyone would be like, “What is happening? This is a very weird social scene.” They did not understand. Then, we became accustomed to it and learned how to interact with it. I remember when smartwatches came out, and all of a sudden you’d have people in meetings checking their watches constantly. I remember the first time it happened to me, and I was like, “Am I so boring? Are they just counting the seconds until they can get out of this meeting?” I realized that they were getting messages and just peeking down. It’s just a different evolution. I do think there’s some of that, and this is a particular push for people. I think we need to be extra sensitive and careful about what it means for children, where we think about if judgment is available to do some of that social processing. I’ll go back to a really important case that the FTC publicly announced. It was referring to the Department of Justice in January against Snap. We didn’t make the complaint public, but we made the referral public and the general series of allegations involving the way Snap’s AI chatbot interacted with children. Now, Chair Ferguson wrote a very long and public dissent when he was a commissioner that was basically about the First Amendment rights of chatbots. That was weird to me and concerning. That’s the kind of thing we do need to have real meaningful debate and discussion about. NP: I’m being told we’re out of time. Thank you so much, commissioners. This was excellent. We’ll have to have you back in soon. RS: Great, thanks. AB: Thank you. Questions or comments about this episode? Hit us up at decoder@theverge.com. We really do read every email!

Title: 4 Big Law firms decided to fight the Trump administration in court — and they're winning

Full Content:
Good morning. A software engineer who has worked at Google and Meta compared their cultures, promotion processes, and workloads. Interestingly, the more stressful company was their favourite to work at. In today's big story, Donald Trump went after one of America's top law firms. Its decision to fight back took just two hours. What's on deck Markets: Early Tesla investor Ross Gerber told BI he's even "more disturbed" after its latest earnings. Tech: Microsoft is trying to simplify its AI sales pitch, slides obtained by BI reveal. Business: Your favorite Amazon products are about to get more expensive. But first, Trump is outgunned in court. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. An "existential crisis" is how Paul Weiss' chairman, Brad Karp, described it. President Donald Trump's slew of executive orders targeting high-profile law firms triggered a fight-or-flight response. Nine law firms took flight and struck deals with the president — Paul Weiss included — collectively promising $940 million in pro bono work for the administration. Four — Perkins Coie, Jenner & Block, WilmerHale, and Susman Godfrey — opted to fight the administration in court. And they're winning. They've argued that the executive orders violate the Constitution, illegally target people and companies for their speech, and violate their clients' right to counsel. In a hearing on April 23, US District Judge Beryl Howell appeared incredulous at the government's arguments. She directed a barrage of often sarcastic questions at Richard Lawson, a Justice Department lawyer, brushing aside some of his positions as "hyper-technical legal arguments that may have no merit." On the docket, meanwhile, the administration is outgunned. The firms suing the government are working with legal heavyweights. Perkins Coie picked Williams & Connolly; Cooley LLP is representing Jenner & Block; Paul Clement is representing WilmerHale; and Susman Godfrey hired Munger Tolles. "You're a bit outmanned here," a judge quipped at Lawson when he showed up alone to a hearing in Susman Godfrey's case earlier this month. Inside the decision to fight back. In a memo to staff, Karp justified Paul Weiss' move to cut a deal with Trump by saying that leadership had "incredibly difficult decisions" to make. For Susman Godfrey, the way forward was clear. No one at the firm spoke with the White House about cutting a deal, according to two people familiar with the matter. BI's Jack Newsham and Jacob Shamsian have exclusive reporting about how Susman Godfrey decided to sue the Trump administration in just two hours. 1. Ross Gerber's not feeling too hot about Tesla. Though investors cheered Elon Musk's impending DOGE departure, Ross Gerber told BI he's even "more disturbed" after its earnings call. Even with Musk back at the helm, Gerber doubts the EV maker can mount a comeback. 2. America is dangerously close to the worst kind of recession. The country's on the verge of stagflation, a condition in which inflation is taking off at the same time as the job market is getting weaker. It's a rock-and-a-hard place situation for the Fed, and leaves investors in a pickle. 3. There are also signs, however, that investors might be able to take a breath. The stock market has flashed a handful of technical signals that suggest the tariff-induced sell-off that kicked off earlier this month may be over. 1. Microsoft cleans up its AI sales pitch. The software giant is trying to streamline how it pitches its many different AI tools — which are all called Copilot — to customers, according to internal presentation slides viewed by BI. The current approach confused customers and slowed sales, insiders said. 2. The manpower driving Tesla's robotaxi launch. The EV maker aims to roll out robotaxis in Austin this June. To prepare, about 300 test operators have been navigating the city's streets over the past few months. Here's what insiders had to say on "Project Rodeo." 3. Everybody talks (too much). Group chat overload has produced a new-old solution: the rise of voice memos. It's part of a broader trend toward speaking over texting for more personal communication. Not everyone's thrilled, though — especially when the calls happen in public. 1. Price hikes are hitting your favorite Amazon products. Some of the site's most popular items are getting pricier amid tariff news, according to data from SmartScout. Some products have even reached record highs, and it's not just an issue for customers. 2. Uber's CEO says your ride could cost less in a recession. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said the ride-hailing service is "recession-resistant" and could even make rides cheaper in a downturn — if more people sign up to be drivers, bringing labor costs down. 3. What do Delta, Thermo Fisher, and Chipotle have in common? They are among the companies lowering or ditching their guidance as tariff chaos mounts. Here's the full list of companies on edge.

Title: Scrapling - An Undetectable, Powerful, Flexible, High-Performance Python Library That Makes Web Scraping Simple And Easy Again!

KitPloit - leading source of Security Tools, Hacking Tools, CyberSecurity and Network Security ☣ Dealing with failing web scrapers due to anti-bot protections or website changes? Meet Scrapling. Scrapling is a high-performance, intelligent web scraping library for Python that automatically adapts to website changes while significantly outperforming popular alternatives. For both beginners and experts, Scrapling provides powerful features while maintaining simplicity. To keep it simple, all methods can be chained on top of each other! Scrapling isn't just powerful - it's also blazing fast. Scrapling implements many best practices, design patterns, and numerous optimizations to save fractions of seconds. All of that while focusing exclusively on parsing HTML documents. Here are benchmarks comparing Scrapling to popular Python libraries in two tests. As you see, Scrapling is on par with Scrapy and slightly faster than Lxml which both libraries are built on top of. These are the closest results to Scrapling. PyQuery is also built on top of Lxml but still, Scrapling is 4 times faster. Scrapling can find elements with more methods and it returns full element Adaptor objects not only the text like AutoScraper. So, to make this test fair, both libraries will extract an element with text, find similar elements, and then extract the text content for all of them. As you see, Scrapling is still 4.5 times faster at the same task. All benchmarks' results are an average of 100 runs. See our benchmarks.py for methodology and to run your comparisons. Scrapling is a breeze to get started with; Starting from version 0.2.9, we require at least Python 3.9 to work. Then run this command to install browsers' dependencies needed to use Fetcher classes If you have any installation issues, please open an issue. Fetchers are interfaces built on top of other libraries with added features that do requests or fetch pages for you in a single request fashion and then return an Adaptor object. This feature was introduced because the only option we had before was to fetch the page as you wanted it, then pass it manually to the Adaptor class to create an Adaptor instance and start playing around with the page. You might be slightly confused by now so let me clear things up. All fetcher-type classes are imported in the same way All of them can take these initialization arguments: auto_match, huge_tree, keep_comments, keep_cdata, storage, and storage_args, which are the same ones you give to the Adaptor class. If you don't want to pass arguments to the generated Adaptor object and want to use the default values, you can use this import instead for cleaner code: then use it right away without initializing like: Also, the Response object returned from all fetchers is the same as the Adaptor object except it has these added attributes: status, reason, cookies, headers, history, and request_headers. All cookies, headers, and request_headers are always of type dictionary. [!NOTE] The auto_match argument is enabled by default which is the one you should care about the most as you will see later. This class is built on top of httpx with additional configuration options, here you can do GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. For all methods, you have stealthy_headers which makes Fetcher create and use real browser's headers then create a referer header as if this request came from Google's search of this URL's domain. It's enabled by default. You can also set the number of retries with the argument retries for all methods and this will make httpx retry requests if it failed for any reason. The default number of retries for all Fetcher methods is 3. Hence: All headers generated by stealthy_headers argument can be overwritten by you through the headers argument You can route all traffic (HTTP and HTTPS) to a proxy for any of these methods in this format http://username:password@localhost:8030 For Async requests, you will just replace the import like below: This class is built on top of Camoufox, bypassing most anti-bot protections by default. Scrapling adds extra layers of flavors and configurations to increase performance and undetectability even further. Note: all requests done by this fetcher are waiting by default for all JS to be fully loaded and executed so you don't have to :) This list isn't final so expect a lot more additions and flexibility to be added in the next versions! This class is built on top of Playwright which currently provides 4 main run options but they can be mixed as you want. Note: all requests done by this fetcher are waiting by default for all JS to be fully loaded and executed so you don't have to :) Using this Fetcher class, you can make requests with: 1) Vanilla Playwright without any modifications other than the ones you chose. 2) Stealthy Playwright with the stealth mode I wrote for it. It's still a WIP but it bypasses many online tests like Sannysoft's. Some of the things this fetcher's stealth mode does include: * Patching the CDP runtime fingerprint. * Mimics some of the real browsers' properties by injecting several JS files and using custom options. * Using custom flags on launch to hide Playwright even more and make it faster. * Generates real browser's headers of the same type and same user OS then append it to the request's headers. 3) Real browsers by passing the real_chrome argument or the CDP URL of your browser to be controlled by the Fetcher and most of the options can be enabled on it. 4) NSTBrowser's docker browserless option by passing the CDP URL and enabling nstbrowser_mode option. Hence using the real_chrome argument requires that you have Chrome browser installed on your device Add that to a lot of controlling/hiding options as you will see in the arguments list below. This list isn't final so expect a lot more additions and flexibility to be added in the next versions! If your case needs more than the element's parent, you can iterate over the whole ancestors' tree of any element like below You can search for a specific ancestor of an element that satisfies a function, all you need to do is to pass a function that takes an Adaptor object as an argument and return True if the condition satisfies or False otherwise like below: You can select elements by their text content in multiple ways, here's a full example on another website: Find all elements that are similar to the current element in location and attributes To increase the complexity a little bit, let's say we want to get all books' data using that element as a starting point for some reason The documentation will provide more advanced examples. Let's say you are scraping a page with a structure like this: And you want to scrape the first product, the one with the p1 ID. You will probably write a selector like this When website owners implement structural changes like The selector will no longer function and your code needs maintenance. That's where Scrapling's auto-matching feature comes into play. How does the auto-matching work? Check the FAQs section for that and other possible issues while auto-matching. Let's use a real website as an example and use one of the fetchers to fetch its source. To do this we need to find a website that will change its design/structure soon, take a copy of its source then wait for the website to make the change. Of course, that's nearly impossible to know unless I know the website's owner but that will make it a staged test haha. To solve this issue, I will use The Web Archive's Wayback Machine. Here is a copy of StackOverFlow's website in 2010, pretty old huh?Let's test if the automatch feature can extract the same button in the old design from 2010 and the current design using the same selector :) If I want to extract the Questions button from the old design I can use a selector like this #hmenus > div:nth-child(1) > ul > li:nth-child(1) > a This selector is too specific because it was generated by Google Chrome. Now let's test the same selector in both versions Note that I used a new argument called automatch_domain, this is because for Scrapling these are two different URLs, not the website so it isolates their data. To tell Scrapling they are the same website, we then pass the domain we want to use for saving auto-match data for them both so Scrapling doesn't isolate them. In a real-world scenario, the code will be the same except it will use the same URL for both requests so you won't need to use the automatch_domain argument. This is the closest example I can give to real-world cases so I hope it didn't confuse you :) Notes: 1. For the two examples above I used one time the Adaptor class and the second time the Fetcher class just to show you that you can create the Adaptor object by yourself if you have the source or fetch the source using any Fetcher class then it will create the Adaptor object for you. 2. Passing the auto_save argument with the auto_match argument set to False while initializing the Adaptor/Fetcher object will only result in ignoring the auto_save argument value and the following warning message text Argument `auto_save` will be ignored because `auto_match` wasn't enabled on initialization. Check docs for more info. This behavior is purely for performance reasons so the database gets created/connected only when you are planning to use the auto-matching features. Same case with the auto_match argument. Inspired by BeautifulSoup's find_all function you can find elements by using find_all/find methods. Both methods can take multiple types of filters and return all elements in the pages that all these filters apply to. So the way it works is after collecting all passed arguments and keywords, each filter passes its results to the following filter in a waterfall-like filtering system. It filters all elements in the current page/element in the following order: Note: The filtering process always starts from the first filter it finds in the filtering order above so if no tag name(s) are passed but attributes are passed, the process starts from that layer and so on. But the order in which you pass the arguments doesn't matter. Examples to clear any confusion :) Here's what else you can do with Scrapling: Saving and retrieving elements manually to auto-match them outside the css and the xpath methods but you have to set the identifier by yourself. To save an element to the database: python >>> element = page.find_by_text('Tipping the Velvet', first_match=True) >>> page.save(element, 'my_special_element') if you want to keep it as lxml.etree object, leave the adaptor_type argument python >>> page.relocate(element_dict) [<Element a at 0x105a2a7b0>] Filtering results based on a function Doing operations on element content is the same as scrapy python quote.re(r'regex_pattern') # Get all strings (TextHandlers) that match the regex pattern quote.re_first(r'regex_pattern') # Get the first string (TextHandler) only quote.json() # If the content text is jsonable, then convert it to json using `orjson` which is 10x faster than the standard json library and provides more options except that you can do more with them like python quote.re( r'regex_pattern', replace_entities=True, # Character entity references are replaced by their corresponding character clean_match=True, # This will ignore all whitespaces and consecutive spaces while matching case_sensitive= False, # Set the regex to ignore letters case while compiling it ) Hence all of these methods are methods from the TextHandler within that contains the text content so the same can be done directly if you call the .text property or equivalent selector function. Doing operations on the text content itself includes Sort all characters in the string as if it were a list and return the new string python quote.sort(reverse=False) To be clear, TextHandler is a sub-class of Python's str so all normal operations/methods that work with Python strings will work with it. Any element's attributes are not exactly a dictionary but a sub-class of mapping called AttributesHandler that's read-only so it's faster and string values returned are actually TextHandler objects so all operations above can be done on them, standard dictionary operations that don't modify the data, and more :) Scrapling is under active development so expect many more features coming soon :) There are a lot of deep details skipped here to make this as short as possible so to take a deep dive, head to the docs section. I will try to keep it updated as possible and add complex examples. There I will explain points like how to write your storage system, write spiders that don't depend on selectors at all, and more... Note that implementing your storage system can be complex as there are some strict rules such as inheriting from the same abstract class, following the singleton design pattern used in other classes, and more. So make sure to read the docs first. [!IMPORTANT] A website is needed to provide detailed library documentation. I'm trying to rush creating the website, researching new ideas, and adding more features/tests/benchmarks but time is tight with too many spinning plates between work, personal life, and working on Scrapling. I have been working on Scrapling for months for free after all. If you like Scrapling and want it to keep improving then this is a friendly reminder that you can help by supporting me through the sponsor button. This section addresses common questions about Scrapling, please read this section before opening an issue. Now because everything about the element can be changed or removed, nothing from the element can be used as a unique identifier for the database. To solve this issue, I made the storage system rely on two things: Together both are used to retrieve the element's unique properties from the database later. 4. Now later when you enable the auto_match parameter for both the Adaptor instance and the method call. The element properties are retrieved and Scrapling loops over all elements in the page and compares each one's unique properties to the unique properties we already have for this element and a score is calculated for each one. 5. Comparing elements is not exact but more about finding how similar these values are, so everything is taken into consideration, even the values' order, like the order in which the element class names were written before and the order in which the same element class names are written now. 6. The score for each element is stored in the table, and the element(s) with the highest combined similarity scores are returned. Not a big problem as it depends on your usage. The word default will be used in place of the URL field while saving the element's unique properties. So this will only be an issue if you used the same identifier later for a different website that you didn't pass the URL parameter while initializing it as well. The save process will overwrite the previous data and auto-matching uses the latest saved properties only. For each element, Scrapling will extract: - Element tag name, text, attributes (names and values), siblings (tag names only), and path (tag names only). - Element's parent tag name, attributes (names and values), and text. That's because passing the auto_save/auto_match argument without setting auto_match to True while initializing the Adaptor object will only result in ignoring the auto_save/auto_match argument value. This behavior is purely for performance reasons so the database gets created only when you are planning to use the auto-matching features. It could be one of these reasons: 1. No data were saved/stored for this element before. 2. The selector passed is not the one used while storing element data. The solution is simple - Pass the old selector again as an identifier to the method called. - Retrieve the element with the retrieve method using the old selector as identifier then save it again with the save method and the new selector as identifier. - Start using the identifier argument more often if you are planning to use every new selector from now on. 3. The website had some extreme structural changes like a new full design. If this happens a lot with this website, the solution would be to make your code as selector-free as possible using Scrapling features. Pretty much yeah, almost all features you get from BeautifulSoup can be found or achieved in Scrapling one way or another. In fact, if you see there's a feature in bs4 that is missing in Scrapling, please make a feature request from the issues tab to let me know. Of course, you can find elements by text/regex, find similar elements in a more reliable way than AutoScraper, and finally save/retrieve elements manually to use later as the model feature in AutoScraper. I have pulled all top articles about AutoScraper from Google and tested Scrapling against examples in them. In all examples, Scrapling got the same results as AutoScraper in much less time. Yes, Scrapling instances are thread-safe. Each Adaptor instance maintains its state. Everybody is invited and welcome to contribute to Scrapling. There is a lot to do!

U.S. stock futures are little changed as markets enter the week on a four-session winning streak and investors prepare for a crowded earnings calendar, including reports from Magnificent Seven firms Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META); Domino's Pizza (DPZ) shares are fall in premarket trading after the company reported weaker-than-expected U.S. same-store sales; German drug giant Merck KGaA agrees to buy U.S. biotech SpringWorks Therapeutics (SWTX) for nearly $4 billion; and shares of Deliveroo soar in London trading after DoorDash (DASH) makes an offer to acquire the British food delivery service. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are edging lower as investors get ready for a busy week of earnings and economic data amid a four-session winning streak for the major indexes. Nasdaq futures are down 0.1% after the tech-favored index added 6.7% last week, while S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures also are slightly lower after gaining last week. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is rising to trade over $95,000. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note are rising slightly. Oil futures are lower. Gold futures are little changed. More than half of the Magnificent Seven companies are scheduled to report quarterly results this week, with Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) all on this week's calendar. Apple's earnings on Thursday come as the iPhone maker has shed 16% of its value this year on concerns over how U.S. tariffs on China will impact the company. Also reporting on Thursday is Amazon, whose stock was recently downgraded due to its exposure to Chinese tariffs. Microsoft and Meta Platform report Wednesday, with the latter's coming as the Instagram parent faces a Federal Trade Commission antitrust court case. Shares of Domino's Pizza (DPZ) are slipping about 2.5% in premarket trading after the company reported weaker-than-expected first-quarter revenue and U.S. same-store sales. The Ann Arbor, Mich.-based company's revenue of $1.11 billion was slightly lower than the consensus of analysts polled by Visible Alpha, while its earnings per share of $4.33 came in above estimates. Same-store sales among Domino's U.S. locations fell by 0.5% year-over-year, worse than the 0.22% bump analysts had forecast. Shares of U.S. biotech SpringWorks Therapeutics (SWTX) are rising more than 3% in premarket trading after German drug company Merck KGaA said it has struck a deal to buy the firm for around $3.9 billion. Merck said it would offer $47 a share in cash for the Stamford, Conn.-based firm. That represents a 26% premium to SpringWorks' 20-day volume-weighted average price of $37.38 on Feb. 7—the day before speculation of a potential deal between the two started, Merck said. SpringWorks shares closed at $44.72 on Friday. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2025. Deliveroo shares are jumping 17% in London trading after DoorDash (DASH) offered to buy the British food delivery firm for 180 pence ($2.40) per share. Deliveroo, which said it had received an "indicative proposal" from DoorDash on April 5, added its board indicated to the U.S. company that "should a firm offer be made" at those terms, it "would be minded to recommend such an offer to Deliveroo shareholders." Shares of DoorDash are little changed in premarket trading.

Title: Marketing has failed big booze but there’s light at the bottom of the bottle

Advertisement April 28, 2025 | 14 min read Listen to article 4 min Andrew Tindall started his marketing career with seven years in the commercial and marketing teams at Bacardi, Innocent, Brown-Forman, and Diageo. Now working in global marketing effectiveness, he reckons the drinks trade has lost its way. A still from I'd like to buy the world a Coke, where they are holding Guinness instead My marketing career began in the drinks business where I developed three bad habits: I’m a sugary juice fiend, I spend far too much time in the pub, and worst of all, I became a certified drink-marketing-wanker (DMW). We are all one or two friends removed from a DMW. You just have to learn how to spot them: All their friends work in booze marketing or behind bars. They constantly outdo each other’s cool new “hidden” bar, like a liquid cultural capital dick-measuring contest. They have WhatsApp groups to debate ad launches, innovation flops, and gossip about people moves like they actually matter to anyone outside Soho. It is the category-navel-gazing that completely screws a DMW’s objectivity so much so that they start thinking a new hard seltzer or gin launch is genuinely culturally significant. However, good DMWs recognize this and rely on customer data to make decisions instead of just pleasing their mates. I’m now three years DMW clean, having left drinks marketing to work in marketing effectiveness. Sure, I still occasionally swirl a mezcal negroni while chortling at the latest celebrity acquisition, but mostly, I’m out. After working across different categories and markets, I can confidently confirm that the drinks category isn’t what it was. I don’t take any joy in writing this. Ignore what that CSO wrote about me on the back of the toilet cubicle door at the Groucho Club; I always try to keep things positive. Yes, there are some brilliant exceptions, but we must wake up and smell the sambuca. The industry that once produced the best marketers has fallen off the wagon. Marketing has failed big-booze. Big-booze stock prices are drunkenly falling. The top houses are all more than 30% down; one is literally down 79%. Listening to industry folk trying to explain this decline quickly sorts them into four camps: The Lifer: This person holds a golden DMW card, is an expert at boardroom politics and has survived 10+ restructures. They’ll always cite “macroeconomic factors.” The Marketing Non-Believer: Considers marketing a cost and (quite rightly) points out how hard procurement teams have dropped the ball. A good example is the tequila mess, where no one could get enough agave, and now there’s a massive oversupply. Whisky planners forecasting 20 years of barrel aging into the future must be howling. The Clueless: Always the loudest. They claim culture has changed (alcohol has become less relevant), people are trading down to cheaper brands, and revenues are slumping as people leave the category for alternatives. The Minority: Understands marketing’s role, so cringes at The Clueless. Knows proper marketing keeps brands in culture, grows categories through penetration, and allows you to charge a premium. You can usually work out which group someone falls into by asking them why the Coca-Cola share price remains impervious to decline and gets Warren Buffett out of bed in the morning. Not every drink brand and business is guilty, obviously, but it’s worth pondering a few key issues. Advertisement Many spirits ads are incredibly “left-brained.” In Orlando Wood’s seminal work, the IPA books ‘Lemon’ and ‘Look out’, he showed that brands must put on a show with “right-brained” creative features to capture attention and elicit emotion from non-buyers. He was forced to name some “left brain” creative features to prove the point with data. You’ll see a lot of spirits clearly use a lot of these: vacant stares, fast cut scenes, overt voiceovers, abstracted body parts and rational product features. This style of work only speaks to the already aware and interested, and struggles to recruit lighter buyers. Elite-DMW Nick Williamson researched over 200 global booze ads and proved this in his drinks ad how-to guide: Raising The Bar. (Reach out if you want to see that.) Beyond the dependency on rational thinking, many ads from big-booze brands look, smell, and taste the same, be it grading, studios, music, sets, lens flare, and the ever-present Gen Z-esque cast. Honestly, go pick a big-booze business. Watch the latest ads from its various brands. The similarities are uncanny and hilarious. Is this procurement having too much sway? Brand managers rotating between brands? Refusal to hire non-drink marketers? I am not sure the agencies are blame-free here either. I once launched a paid Meta campaign for a whisky brand, a competitor launched something similar on Meta the week after and I shit you not: they’d picked the same music and used the same studio. Also, innovation has been replaced with chasing incremental flavors and slimming down glass bottles at the expense of distinctiveness. Or launching global travel retail “exclusives” that eventually fail and end up in the staff shop. You hear horror stories as stock prices get spicy and trousers get soiled. “We must focus on the core.” I agree; get back to brand building, not incremental flavor BS, while we wind back investment in anything that will pay back in 5+ years. Incubation and brand accelerator budgets have been slashed. And the biggest crime of all: no one has managed to arrest the endless discounting. Some of your favorite spirit brands are sold on offer in grocery 95%+ of the time. I understand grocers need their pound of flesh. I understand shelf space, joint business plans, and how you get activation space. But if you pulled that at a P&G or Unilever brand, the CMO would personally come and drag you from your desk to the front door, no matter how many times you say “revenue growth management”. Saving the largest discounts for Christmas as well is like a florist doing a deal on roses for Valentine’s Day. When did you last buy a case of beer or a bottle of spirit at full price? As one of my DMW mentors always laughs, “Why charge for it when you can give it away?” It’s hard not to rant like this when you care about the industry and brands. And you see friends losing jobs, unable to find new ones. Marketing’s role in society is to turn the wheels of commerce. It’s noble. Without exposing myself as a card-carrying capitalist too much. What really prompted me to bother writing this was re-listening to Tito’s CMO (Taylor Berry) on The CMO podcast. A rare podcast episode that I’ve found myself diving back into multiple times over the past few years. This guy really gets it. It only has six product lines (SKUs). I’ve worked on tiny, tiny brands with hundreds. Tito’s refused to jump on trends but focused on driving its brand power. It found an emotional brand platform and stuck with it over the years while still keeping it creative and interesting. This got me thinking about the green shoots we see in the industry from people who clearly get it, green shoots of marketing hope. There’s the obvious advertising and culture work coming from Guinness, maybe the less obvious, incredibly consistent ‘Do What Moves You’ Bacardi Rum campaign that gets far too little recognition for what it’s managed to do for its market share. White Claw’s creation of a global category should also be studied. The Woodsman whisky’s creation of Barry the Beaver and the results that followed, in a category determined to discuss flavor benefits, is heartwarming. 5-star work in System1’s testing and subsequent market share gobbling. Poretti’s first powerful stake in the ground with their new foxy work is also magnificent. De Kuyper’s purchase of the dormant giant Archer’s Peach Schnapps and investment in a brand refresh and new campaign to turn latent awareness into salience is poised to yield brilliant results. Honestly, Gemma Collins is exactly what this brand needs, even if the bottle refresh went a little too far. Speaking of excellent celeb use, Malibu’s new work with Brian Cox is right-brained AF. Malibu is consistently doing some interesting things to drive brand fame. It has to as rival premium coconut rums pop up left, right and centre. Cox really makes all other drinks ads (a category inherently rooted in friends, fun, and relaxation) look serious, boring, and stuffy. And AU vodka is, by some measures, the fastest growing global brand (not drink brand, brand). I can’t reference any big TV ads because it hasn’t done any. Growth has come from a genuine market orientation that birthed a garish gold bottle, a high-color high-flavor strategy (that changed the category), authentic celeb collabs, and owning where few DMWs have bothered to step foot in - a corner shop. Top-shelf vodka brands are getting shown up by a couple of mates from Swansea. But the brand that should really give us hope is the one that should be the most impressive marketing story of the past decade. Heineken’s Birra Morreti. What a champion of a brand. It's just about to overtake Peroni’s off-trade sales, off the back of the ‘Enjoy Life’s Simple Pleasures’ brand platform, which just hit the System1 database. The second highest scoring beer ad we’ve tested. Cracking work from Lucky Generals as always. It lost volume last year but managed to grow by increasing its price by 11%. You see this in about 3% of IPA case studies and 5% of WARC’s. Bloody brilliant. And its Birra Moretti Sale Di Mare (sea salt) is a great example of fluent innovation (80% familiar, 20% new). It’s not all doom and gloom. Marketers who are smashing it will raise the bar. Let’s just hope everyone gets serious and catches up before the decent ones all go and start marketing toilet roll. The minority must become the majority. Right, all this writing made me thirsty, so I went off to the pub. And not for juice. Email all your complaints about the above here.

Title: Meta Earnings Preview: What To Know About The Stock Before The Upcoming Report
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/meta-stock-earnings-preview-what-to-know/
Time Published: 2025-04-28T10:00:00Z

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. More analysts view Meta's legal and macroeconomic risks as temporary problems vs. long-term issues. Meta Platforms (META) will report its first-quarter earnings on April 30, 2025. Prep for the report with this review of how the company is doing, what analysts expect and which data points will be most telling in the upcoming Meta stock earnings presentation. Year to date, Meta stock is down almost 9%. The stock reached its 2025 high of $740.91 on February 14, after announcing consensus-beating performance for the fourth quarter and then raising its dividend. As with other tech companies, the recent expansion of the U.S. tariff policy has taken a toll on Meta’s stock price. After U.S. President Donald Trump announced a sweeping set of tariffs on April 2, Meta dipped more than 13% in two trading days. Today, the stock trades for about $547 per share. Prior to this year, Meta stock had been trending up with volatility. The stock gained 67% in 2024 and 194% in 2023 on higher revenue and earnings. Earnings growth was the headlining story in both years: Diluted EPS grew 60% in 2024 and 73% in the year prior. Key components of Meta's first-quarter earnings presentation will include updates on sales, profits, user engagement, ad prices and the company's artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives. Meta has beaten analysts’ expectations for revenue and EPS for seven consecutive quarters. The company makes its money selling digital advertising across its network of apps, and demand has been strong. Earnings have benefited from cost-cutting efforts that began in 2023, a period CEO Mark Zuckerberg called the "year of efficiency." Continued strong increases in revenue and EPS demonstrate a good balance between Meta's capital-intensive growth initiatives and operational execution. Family DAP is Meta’s high-level user engagement metric. Family refers to the company's portfolio of applications: Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. The DAP metric quantifies how many people log in and access a Meta app in a day. For a company that sells digital ads, family DAP is like inventory. When more people use Meta apps, there are more advertising impressions to sell. Not only that, but advertising demand and effectiveness can rise as the user base grows. This is because a larger user base provides more data and audience targeting options. Meta's family DAP has been increasing for years, but the pace of growth has fluctuated between 4.27% and 15.45% since 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2024, family DAP was 3.35 billion, about 5% higher than the prior-year period. Strength in ad prices indicates good demand. It signals that advertisers are generally happy with the value they’re getting for their ad investment. Alongside a rising inventory of ad impressions, this perception of value is critical for long-term growth. If ads don't deliver results, advertisers will spend their money elsewhere. Average ad price can be a tricky metric for digital advertisers. There are several huge players in this space—Google, Amazon, TikTok and Reddit, to name a few. Each is working to build its audience, which creates a continually expanding supply of advertising opportunities. Demand must grow also to keep advertising rates strong. In 2024, Meta increased its average ad price by 10%. Meta regularly reports what it spends on capital investments, including AI. Total capital expenditures in 2024 was $39.2 billion. CFO Susan Li said the company expects to spend a jaw-dropping $60 billion to $65 billion in 2025. AI represents Meta’s most compelling growth opportunity. The company is developing an open-source large language model called Llama. Morningstar reports that Llama is among the most cost-efficient LLMs available today. Additionally, if Meta can make further cost improvements, Llama has many interesting use cases—from generating effective, customized ad content for advertisers to reducing Meta's application development costs. Given Meta's investment in AI, investors want to see these use cases take shape as transformational and competition-busting business initiatives. Every global company faces macroeconomic risks. Three factors to watch for Meta are consumer spending, the U.S. regulatory environment and the ongoing U.S. trade war with China. A slowdown in consumer spending in the U.S. and globally lessens the return potential for digital advertising. Advertisers are likely to limit their advertising budgets in response. Should the U.S. or other major economies fall into recession, Meta would feel the impact as slowing or negative sales growth. Meta is currently defending an antitrust lawsuit brought forth by the Federal Trade Commission. The suit could require the company to divest Instagram and WhatsApp. Congress is also investigating whether Meta collaborated with the Chinese government at the expense of U.S. national security. How far these cases go could define Meta's future. Some outlets report that Zuckerberg has courted President Trump to alleviate his company's legal woes. Time will tell if that strategy proves effective. Wells Fargo analysts estimate that 11% of Meta's revenue comes from China-based advertisers, as quoted by Investing.com. These revenues are at risk under President Trump's new tariff policy that imposes taxes of up to 245% on imported Chinese goods. The tariff costs can be absorbed by Chinese sellers or passed on to U.S. consumers, but either strategy likely limits advertising returns. In its last earnings presentation, Meta shared a first-quarter revenue guidance range of $39.5 billion to $41.8 billion. According to Tradingview.com, analysts expect the company to produce $41.38 billion revenue, near the high end of the guidance. Analysts also expect EPS of $5.24. These numbers represent quarter-over-quarter revenue growth of 14.4% and EPS growth of 21.3%. Out of 72 analysts, 53 rate Meta a strong buy and 10 rate the company a buy. There are also seven hold ratings, one sell rating and one strong sell rating. Price targets range from $448 to $900, averaging to $710.90, which is about 30% higher than the current Meta stock price. Meta's stock price has declined in April, but this seems more related to the ongoing U.S. tariff saga than a company-specific trend. Many stocks and the S&P 500 have followed the same trajectory. Bottom Line Things to love about Meta right now are its revenue momentum, improving efficiency and exciting AI initiatives. However, the company also has some legal trouble to manage and may face short-term headwinds related to the U.S. economy and the trade war with China. These won’t impact first-quarter results, but investors should pay close attention to leadership's commentary on these topics during the earnings webcast. So far, more analysts view the legal and macroeconomic risks as temporary problems vs. long-term issues. If that's accurate, now may be the time to scoop up Meta at a good price. Otherwise, see best stocks for 2025 for more investing ideas.

Title: What Tech Workforce Changes Could Mean For Opportunistic Family Offices

ByFrancois Botha ByFrancois Botha, Senior Contributor. The Intel headquarters in Santa Clara could end up a ghost town if their planned "de-laboring" ends ... More up being an extensive exercise. The past week’s markets seem confused. Alphabet’s stock price went up after strong earnings, great news for investors, even while the company has significantly reduced jobs. Major tech businesses including Intel and Meta are cutting large numbers of workers. Public interest as seen in Google trends about these changes continues to rise, showing that something deeper than just cost cuts is taking place. These moves point to broader market shifts as companies put more focus on artificial intelligence and reconsider staffing and global trade issues. Family offices investing in public and private technology companies will likely pay close attention. Three critical areas now require their focus: managing investment risk, finding talented people, and discovering new business opportunities. Managing Investment Risk in an Uncertain Market Tech companies today don’t just deal with internal changes like layoffs and cost reductions. Bigger global issues such as tariffs, trade conflicts, and political challenges directly affect the companies’ costs, supply chains, and profits. Family offices, in turn, must now consider these global factors carefully. It's no longer enough to just review a company's quarterly earnings or internal plans. Tariff changes, broken supply chains, and shifting international trade rules must all factor into an investor’s planning. To manage these risks, family offices should carefully evaluate how global issues affect each business they invest in. They should also spread their investments across different markets or industries to lower overall risk and protect against unexpected events. People as Assets, Not Costs: Building Teams for the Future Recent workforce reductions at tech companies have placed many skilled professionals back onto the hiring market. For family offices, this creates fresh opportunity to hire talent for their own teams or for the businesses they support. Many family offices are now operating similarly to technology startup teams. They view finding and hiring talented people as an investment, rather than viewing employees as expenses. Skills related to cyber security, artificial intelligence, digital compliance, and data analysis have become especially valuable. To succeed, family offices must invest in training and developing their teams. They should encourage staff to expand their knowledge and skills and give employees the opportunity to learn new tasks. Family offices can also help the businesses they own in identifying and hiring people with valuable skills who might otherwise be missed. Success won't result from reacting after the fact. It requires thoughtful planning and a commitment to continually build and reshape effective, adaptable teams. Humans and Technology Working Together Recent tech industry adjustments have raised questions about the future role of workers. Many discussions revolve around which tasks humans will continue to perform and which can be handled by artificial intelligence and technology. These discussions shouldn’t focus exclusively on replacing human workers. Instead, effective solutions will involve people and technology working side by side. Human abilities such as judgment, critical thinking, and contextual understanding remain difficult for machines to handle and will remain highly important for years to come. Family offices that understand this reality will hire people whose skills complement technology. Areas such as compliance, ethical considerations, client relationships, and interpretation of data still clearly depend on human understanding. Importantly, family offices should look for team members who are flexible, eager to learn new skills, and open to evolving their roles as technology advances and market needs change. Staying Flexible in a Changing Market The recent tech sector changes signal deeper shifts than ordinary market ups and downs. Family offices risk serious disappointment when they follow trends without careful thought. Instead, successful family offices will focus on thoughtful analysis and maintain patience, remaining ready to quickly adapt to market changes. To navigate successfully, family offices should question popular assumptions and avoid investments driven by hype. They should examine each potential opportunity carefully and clearly. Those who keep an open mind, remain committed to learning, and think independently will be best suited to thrive. Opportunistic family offices can stand out by understanding market conditions thoroughly, thoughtfully building strong teams, effectively pairing human insight with technology, and preparing themselves to respond decisively to change.

Title: SPAS-12 History Value: Legacy and Rising Price

Time Published: 2025-04-27T14:00:00Z

The SPAS-12 shotgun, with its rich history and significant value, stands as one of the most iconic firearms of its time. Known for its unique design and powerful performance, the SPAS-12’s history and value have only grown over the years, making it a prized collectible for enthusiasts. Check out our video reel showcasing the SPAS-12 in action on Facebook and Instagram: The SPAS-12 (Special Purpose Automatic Shotgun) was a combat shotgun manufactured by the Italian firearms company Franchi S.p.A. from 1979 to 2000. Initially designed as a law enforcement and military shotgun, the SPAS-12 became iconic due to its unique dual-mode action, allowing it to function as both a semi-automatic and pump-action shotgun. Its distinctive appearance, combined with a folding metal stock, heat shield, and overall aggressive design, contributed to its cult status among firearm enthusiasts, collectors, and Hollywood filmmakers alike. The SPAS-12 was unique in that it was one of the few shotguns designed with a dual-action mode, allowing the user to switch between semi-automatic and pump-action operation. The ability to cycle between these modes gave it a tactical advantage in specific scenarios. In semi-automatic mode, it could rapidly fire shells, while in pump-action mode, it could handle a broader range of ammunition, including lower-powered shells that might not cycle in a gas-operated system. Some other notable features include: Due to its versatility and intimidating appearance, the SPAS-12 was marketed toward military, law enforcement, and civilian buyers, although it was ultimately restricted in many regions due to firearm regulations. In 1994, the United States Federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB) was enacted under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act (Public Law No. 103-322). This legislation restricted the sale and importation of certain firearms based on a set of cosmetic and functional features, rather than their actual operational capabilities. The SPAS-12, with its tactical appearance, pistol grip, and semi-automatic functionality, was classified as an “excessively lethal firearm” by proponents of the ban. Critics of the law, including firearm experts and enthusiasts, pointed out that the SPAS-12 was mechanically similar to other commonly used semi-automatic and pump-action shotguns used for hunting, skeet shooting, and home defense. Despite this, the gun’s aggressive aesthetic led it to be vilified by gun-control advocates who often lacked technical knowledge about firearms (Koper, 2004). This flawed logic exposed the major weaknesses of the ban. The legislation focused heavily on appearances rather than functionality, meaning firearms that operated identically to banned guns but looked different remained legal. The SPAS-12, for example, was essentially just a heavier, bulkier version of many legally available shotguns. The law failed to target criminal misuse of firearms, instead restricting law-abiding citizens from purchasing certain guns simply because they looked “scary.” Further demonstrating its ineffectiveness, a 2004 study funded by the U.S. Department of Justice found that the Assault Weapons Ban had no measurable impact on gun violence during its ten-year enforcement (Koper, 2004). Even the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) conducted a meta-analysis and found “insufficient evidence” that banning certain firearms reduced crime rates (Hahn et al., 2005). The sunset clause in the AWB ensured that the law would expire on September 13, 2004, unless renewed by Congress, which did not occur (Kleck, 2001). However, due to the ban’s restrictions on importation, shipments of the SPAS-12 to the United States ended in 1994, with Franchi ultimately ceasing production of the model in 2000. Ironically, instead of reducing access to “dangerous weapons,” the ban fueled demand for firearms like the SPAS-12, driving up prices and making them more desirable to collectors. Today, the SPAS-12 remains a sought-after collectible, proving that cosmetic bans do little more than inconvenience lawful gun owners while failing to address actual crime. The SPAS-12 gained legendary status not only among firearm collectors but also in Hollywood and video games. It was famously wielded by Arnold Schwarzenegger’s T-800 in The Terminator (1984), reinforcing its image as a formidable weapon. Additionally, Robert Muldoon, the game warden in Jurassic Park (1993), carried a SPAS-12 while facing off against velociraptors. The gun also became a staple in the gaming world, appearing in franchises such as: This widespread representation cemented the SPAS-12’s place in pop culture, making it one of the most recognizable shotguns ever produced. Many firearm enthusiasts consider the SPAS-12 to be a “grail gun”, meaning it is a highly desirable and rare firearm in the collecting community. The limited availability and cultural significance of the SPAS-12 have led to a massive increase in its market value. When the shotgun was still in production, its retail price in the United States was approximately $1,500 in its final year of availability. By 2016, auction prices for the SPAS-12 had climbed to an average of $2,588 (Rock Island Auction, 2016). The value increase continued at an unprecedented rate, and by 2022, the price of an SPAS-12 at auction had skyrocketed to an average of $7,000. As of 2025, the SPAS-12 remains one of the hottest collectibles in the firearms market, with some pristine examples exceeding $10,000 at auction. This dramatic price surge outpaces many other classic firearms and highlights the enduring demand for rare and historically significant tactical shotguns (Miller, 2023).

The Benelli M2 also has the option to switch between semi-auto and pump, though the semi action is inertia blowback instead of gas-operated. That makes the cycling unreliable when the M2 isn’t fully shouldered/supported (like when firing from the hip). Similar to “limp-wristing” a Glock. I remember those things. The joke at time was that it was called SPAS because a spase is what it is. (Slang at the time among teens for another kid that was socially awkward.) Never owned one, but I did own a Benelli M3 Super 90. Pump/auto. Neither fish nor fowl. Hated it. Disposed of it at the first gun show I could. Liked all the M1 Super 90s I owned. Let’s see 1500 in 2000 money adjusted for inflation to 2025 would be 2,785 so 2016 probably would have been the last reasonable price.

Despite this, the gun’s aggressive aesthetic led it to be vilified by gun-control advocates who often lacked technical knowledge about firearms (Koper, 2004).” The old piss poor sporting purpose defense of the 2A all while not defining Gun Control by its History…how dare we embarrass our Gun Control colleagues. The Founders and millions of defenseless victims of Gun Control were rolling over in their graves. Thankfully Bush II let the clinton/biden Gun Control insanity sunset. As for Franchi they produce nice shotguns. I own one since 1996. There are easier shotguns to use in pump action and reload, but when you start shooting it fast in semiauto, the muzzle rise is minimal. Also the recoil is… tame. That thing shoots fast and straight. I love it, and after many thousands of rounds, tens of thousands, it still goes as new. Top!!! “Robust build”? Except for those parts made from plastic which are getting brittle with age. Plastic doesn’t get brittle. I’ve a pair of Glocks made in 1851 and they’re still as robust as they were when Wild Bill Hickok was using them. I forgot to say. $10,000 for one of these things? What do they say about a fool and his money? This is not a three digit serial number, first generation Colt SAA calvary model. Scarcity is a bitch, see also Colt python pre2020, s&w pre lock, pre freedom group Marlin lever rifles for silliness at the low end. Could probably throw in Kimber for pre mim parts Safe, I understand. I have a 6″ stainless Python that I bought for myself as a present to myself when I got out of the U. S. Army. A long time ago. I can touch a 6 1/2″ 2nd model hand ejector target.44 Spl and a S&W 28 Highway Patrolman now. Everyone says they’re worth a lot more than I paid for them. Good. But a SPAS? No accounting for collectors, still at a loss to explain the $500+ pricing for Nagant rifles. Supply shortage caused by the war in Ukraine? Many have been spotted being used in the conflict. The market will achieve equilibrium. If they were still in production and not disappearing on a battlefield where they will never get to the US sure. Realistically it will be a long time of a lot of estate sales allowing them to trickle back into the market that has enough other desirable products to see any reasonable drop in prices for milsurp of any kind…….. except maybe m1 carbines we may eventually get some of those back in large numbers. The first thing that comes to my mind when I see this gun is “Clever girl”. Unfortunately, it’s not a shining moment for the gun.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) and reminds investors of the May 5, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. Then, on March 26, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a report (the “Muddy Waters Report”) concluding that AppLovin systematically used proprietary third-party data in ways that violated the terms of service of Facebook, Google, Snap, Reddit, as well as other platforms, potentially leading to backlash and service blocking and threatening the sustainability of AppLovin’s revenue growth. On this news, AppLovin’s stock price plummeted 20.1 percent, dropping from $327.62 to $261.70 per share on March 27, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding AppLovin’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the AppLovin class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/APP or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Title: Economic Digest: Nepal’s Business News in a Snap
URL: https://english.khabarhub.com/2025/26/461412/
Time Published: 2025-04-26T02:15:42Z
Full Content:
26 April 2025 Time taken to read : 12 Minute KATHMANDU: Economic Digest offers a concise yet comprehensive overview of significant business happenings in Nepal, presented in easily digestible summaries. The compiled reports reflect a broad spectrum of Nepal’s economic and governance dynamics, highlighting issues of regulatory enforcement, infrastructure development, and investment patterns. While NEPSE saw a minor rebound after days of decline, gold prices fell by NPR 1,000 per tola, and consumers continue to bear inflated petroleum costs despite a global price slump—benefiting Nepal Oil Corporation’s profit margins. Regulatory tightening was evident with Nepal Rastra Bank penalizing financial institutions and the Insurance Authority revising foreign employment fund rules. Simultaneously, Facebook faces a registration ultimatum, while Durga Prasai’s multi-billion-rupee loan default case underscores growing scrutiny of corporate misconduct. On the legislative front, the government introduced a bill restricting Everest climbs without prior experience and restructured taxi service standards. Meanwhile, infrastructure remains a mixed picture—rapid bridge construction in Saptari contrasts with chronic delays in Achham and Bajura. In trade and investment, local goods from Humla found markets in China, and Koshi Province reached out to Indian investors. Similarly, the NRNA Australia pledged investment interest, pending a friendlier climate. Despite having sufficient domestic production, the government controversially approved areca nut imports, raising questions about policy priorities. Other highlights include Sun Nepal Life’s rights share issuance, a capped agriculture budget amid high provincial demands, and calls to upgrade critical road segments affecting tourism. Despite global political shifts, MCC aid to Nepal remains intact, reinforcing continued strategic ties with the U.S. Nepse sees minor uptick after consecutive losses The Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) index recorded a slight rise of 2.08 points (0.07%) on the final trading day of the week, closing at 2,658.02. After four days of steady decline, Thursday saw a mild recovery driven by increased investor activity. Out of the traded companies, shares of 83 firms rose, 161 declined, and one remained unchanged. While most sector indices dropped, the trade index climbed by 17.72 points, hydropower rose by 7.73 points, and investment increased by 2.81 points. Gold prices dropped to NPR 189,600 per tola on Friday, down from NPR 190,600 the previous day, according to the Federation of Nepal Gold and Silver Dealers’ Association. Silver prices held steady at NPR 2,000 per tola. On the global market, gold was trading at approximately USD 3,325 per ounce. Despite a 23.53% decline in international crude oil prices since the start of this fiscal year, the Nepal Oil Corporation has passed on minimal price reductions to consumers while posting profits of NPR 9 billion. Petrol prices have dropped by only 6.43%, while diesel, kerosene, and aviation fuel were reduced by 8.75%. The price of cooking gas has remained unchanged. MCC assistance to Nepal unaffected by U.S. political shifts Despite the re-election of Donald Trump and changes in U.S. foreign policy, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) will continue its support to Nepal. According to Reuters, the Trump administration, under close ally Elon Musk, has ordered the suspension of MCC programs in most countries, except for Nepal and three others. Trump has questioned the effectiveness of such aid programs, arguing against the misuse of American taxpayer funds. Minister for Communication and Information Technology, Prithvi Subba Gurung, has issued a one-week ultimatum to Meta (Facebook’s parent company) to register in Nepal. Speaking at a program organized by the National Information Commission, he warned that failure to register would result in a ban. The minister emphasized that Meta earns substantial revenue from Nepal and must comply with tax and regulatory obligations, stating that no foreign corporation can be allowed to bypass national laws. Since the Mothihari-Amlekhganj petroleum pipeline came into operation six years ago, over 57 million kiloliters (5.71 billion liters) of diesel have been imported into Nepal. The Madhesh Regional Office of Nepal Oil Corporation reports that between 1,353 to 3,568 kiloliters are imported daily. In the first nine months of the current fiscal year alone, the import volume reached 851,338 kiloliters, with daily imports averaging 2,840 kiloliters in the last fiscal year. The Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) has taken disciplinary action against five financial institutions for breaching banking norms. These include three development banks—Mukti Nath, Narayani, and Salpa—and two finance companies—Janaki and Pokhara Finance. Among the violations, Mukti Nath’s chairman Bharat Raj Dhakal was found involved in unauthorized construction activities, leading NRB to issue an official warning. For the next fiscal year, the Ministry of Agriculture has capped the budget for new agricultural projects at NPR 1 billion across provincial and local levels. However, proposals from these governments have already exceeded NPR 30 billion. Minister Ramnath Adhikari stated that this ceiling includes funding for rural roads, markets, livestock programs, organic fertilizers, and crop improvement. The Non-Resident Nepali Association (NRNA) of Australia has expressed its intention to increase investments in Nepal. In a meeting with Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, NRNA Australia president Anil Pokhrel emphasized the desire of the Australian NRN community to invest more, provided Nepal ensures an investor-friendly environment. Discussions also included strengthening trade and economic ties, leveraging the investment framework, and enhancing bilateral cooperation between the two countries. The Nepal Insurance Authority has made a second amendment to the regulations governing the Foreign Employment Group Insurance Fund (PUL). Under the new rule, insurance companies must deposit premium records from the 1st to 15th of each month into the designated bank account by the 1st of the following month. Similar requirements apply to the second half of the month. Insurance companies must also submit details of claims and premium receipts to the fund manager, who must confirm the transactions. The Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport has introduced new national standards for taxi services under the “National Standards for Vehicles Used as Taxis 2081,” replacing those of 2076. The updated classification divides taxis into three categories—Ordinary, Deluxe, and Luxury—based on features like size, performance, and amenities. These rules apply to all taxis, including existing and newly registered ones. A proposed provision in the new Tourism Bill 2081 bars individuals from attempting Mount Everest unless they have previously summited a 7,000-meter Himalayan peak. The bill, registered in the National Assembly by the Ministry of Culture, Tourism, and Civil Aviation, also requires climbers to submit health certificates. Those deemed medically unfit will be barred from mountaineering or joining climbing teams. This bill will replace the Tourism Act of 2035 B.S. At the Nepal-India Partnership Summit held in Purnia, Bihar, the Koshi Province Committee of the Nepal-India Chamber of Commerce and Industry (NICCI) encouraged Indian investors to consider projects in the province. Committee president Mukesh Upadhyay highlighted investment potential in tourism, agriculture, and other sectors. The event was held in collaboration with organizations like the Sub-Himalayan Research Institute and the Nepal-India Centre. Sun Nepal Life Insurance Company is set to issue 27% rights shares, totaling 10,696,320 shares at NPR 100 per share. The total value of the issue is NPR 1.07 billion. Shareholders recorded by Baishakh 4 are eligible to apply during the open window from Baishakh 30 to Jestha 19. Nepal SBI Merchant Banking is managing the rights issuance. The Gandaki chapter of the Hotel Association Nepal (HAN) has urged the government to expedite improvements along the Narayanghat-Butwal section of the East-West Highway. Chairman Hariprasad Sharma Gaire stated that delays in upgrading the road have caused significant hardship for both tourists and locals, with ongoing dust and mud making travel unpleasant. The government has permitted the import of over 11,000 tons of areca nut for the next six months, even though local production—estimated at 14,500 tons annually—is sufficient. Critics argue that the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies yielded to pressure from interest groups, especially after scrapping the import quota system last month. Six bridges have been completed in Saptari within the first nine months of the current fiscal year, and seven others are nearing completion, according to the Lahan Road Division Office. Chief Ashutosh Karna said that while load testing remains pending, these efforts aim to expand road infrastructure in the district. Notable projects include bridges on the Ghode Daha River and along the Rajbiraj-Chhinnamasta road. Despite allocating NPR 3.57 billion for 13 road projects in Achham and Bajura, delays persist across 14 out of 19 contracts awarded by the Infrastructure Development Office. Among these, two are designated as provincial pride projects. So far, NPR 1.89 billion has been spent, with NPR 573 million allocated for the current year. Deadline extensions have not resolved construction delays. Local producers in Humla have successfully exported traditional food products to Taklakot, China, under a cross-border trade agreement. Mukunda Rokaya, an entrepreneur from Simkot Municipality-6, reported that the initial shipment—featuring millet and buckwheat flour, walnut oil, and more—generated NPR 1.8 million in revenue. Controversial businessman and healthcare entrepreneur Durga Prasai is being investigated for loan defaults totaling over NPR 7 billion, related to three of his projects. Previously known for leading anti-loan repayment protests, Prasai now faces allegations of threatening bank officials, including a former NRB governor. He has been taken into police custody as investigations continue.

RECAP: Asian shares rose yesterday in line with a global relief rally as trade tensions cooled and US Federal Reserve officials indicated they would be open to cutting interest rates earlier than anticipated. The SET index moved in a range of 1,127.46 and 1,161.03 points this week, before closing yesterday at 1,159.00, up 0.7% from the previous week, with daily turnover averaging 34.94 billion baht. NEWSMAKERS: US President Donald Trump has signalled a potential U-turn in his trade war with China amid continued market volatility, saying the high tariffs on Chinese goods will "come down substantially, but it won't be zero". COMING UP: On Monday, France releases employment data. On Tuesday, the US releases consumer confidence and job openings updates, and China reports manufacturing PMI. On Wednesday, Germany reports first-quarter GDP and updated inflation data; the US releases quarterly GDP and crude oil inventories, and the Bank of Japan announces interest rate decision. STOCKS TO WATCH: InnovestX Securities says that if the Thai policy interest rate is cut next week, it could provide positive sentiment for stocks, in addition to the expected boost when Thai ESGX funds begin trading on May 2.

April 25, 2025 13:50 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, April 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Just months after basking in the glow of a meteoric 700% stock surge, fueled by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence technology and burgeoning ad business, AppLovin Corp. (NASDAQ: APP) is facing a shift in sentiment on Wall Street. Several prominent investment banks have significantly lowered their expectations for the stock following the release of multiple critical reports from short-selling firms about the mobile advertising technology firm. Adding to its woes, AppLovin is now facing a securities class action lawsuit. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Analysts Downgrade APP Shares The latest blow came on Friday, April 11, when The Goldman Sachs Group slashed its price target for AppLovin from a lofty $500.00 to a more sobering $335.00. This downgrade followed a similar move by UBS Group earlier in the week, when the firm reduced its price target on AppLovin from $630.00 to $450.00. Short Seller Onslaught: Allegations of Data Exploitation and Inflated Metrics These downward revisions follow a barrage of critical reports from short sellers. Most recently, on March 28, Muddy Waters Research alleged that AppLovin's ad technology "systematically" violates app store rules by "impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs" from major platforms to deliver targeted ads without user consent. The report also claimed a significant churn rate among e-commerce advertisers, contradicting company statements. Earlier, in February, Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research had also critiqued AppLovin's AXON software, with Fuzzy Panda later urging the S&P 500 committee to exclude the company due to alleged "data theft" and "revenue fraud." Securities Class Action Alleges Misleading Statements Adding to AppLovin's challenges, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against the company. The lawsuit alleges that AppLovin misled investors about the capabilities of its enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and its "cutting-edge AI technologies." Specifically, the lawsuit claims that AppLovin created a false impression that its technology would efficiently match advertisements to mobile games and expand into web-based marketing and e-commerce. However, the suit alleges that AppLovin was instead exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices, including a "backdoor installation scheme," to force unwanted apps on customers. This allegedly inflated installation numbers and, consequently, the company's profit figures. The class action lawsuit further points to the short seller reports released on February 26, 2025, which detailed AppLovin's alleged reverse engineering and exploitation of advertising data from Meta Platforms. These reports also claimed that AppLovin utilized manipulative practices to artificially inflate ad click-through and app download rates, such as self-clicking ads and employing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads. Following the release of these reports, the price of AppLovin shares reportedly fell by more than 12%. Hagens Berman’s Investigation Prominent shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the claims. “The allegations detailed in the short reports and outlined in the recently filed class action complaint, detailing the purported exploitation of user data and manipulative installation schemes, raise serious questions about the integrity of AppLovin's reported growth and the accuracy of its disclosures to the investing public,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.
