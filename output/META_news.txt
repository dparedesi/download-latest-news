Hoka sneakers are comfortable and supportive, but they come at a premium price. While many of the brand’s designs retail for $150 or more, you can get them for less by shopping some of our favorite Hoka deals below. Right now, you can score discounts on five women’s styles and six men’s styles, including 19% off our gear team’s pick for the best trail running shoe overall, the Hoka Speedgoat 5. You can save as much as 50% on a fresh pair of sneakers with this week's best Hoka deals. In addition to landing a spot on our list of the best trail running shoes, we also named a Hoka style one of the best shoes for standing all day. Whether you’re a walker, runner or simply looking for a colorful pair of sneakers to complement your athleisure, these are the best Hoka deals available right now. Hoka This sneaker is our gear team’s pick for the best trail running shoe overall. It’s comfortable with tons of cushion and lighter than the previous iteration. This discount is only available in three colorways, but a solid range of sizes. Hoka If you’re not sold on the Speedgoat 5, check out the Torrent 3, on sale for 20% off. The style is also designed for trail running, featuring a durable outsole, low-profile cushioning and neutral support. You can shop three colors at the moment, but sizing is limited. REI Avid hikers will appreciate this boot’s ample cushioning and Hubble heel design (for smoother heel-to-toe movement). The shoe is also waterproof and has a more streamlined aesthetic than your classic hiking boot. This discount is currently available in the color pictured above. Hoka We named the Hoka Arahi 7, which is designed to keep your feet from overpronating, the best cushioned sneaker for arch support (as well as the best stability running shoe for men). This discount is only available in the pictured colorway, but most sizes are still in stock. Dick's Sporting Goods Designed to balance cushion with a streamlined silhouette, this lightweight shoe is great for racing and daily runs. Four colors are currently on sale—some for even less—but the pictured colorway has the widest range of sizes available. Nordstrom You can find two colorways of the Mach 5 on sale for an impressive 44% off right now. (More colors are on sale for $112, if you don’t mind spending a bit more.) The lightweight shoe has a breathable mesh upper and low-profile cushion that gives it a snappy push-off that runners love. Hoka This streamlined sneaker is made for serious trail runners. It has a breathable, fitted upper that keeps debris out and a grippy sole that’s firm and low to the ground for better push-off. This discount is available directly from Hoka in six colors. Hoka As we mentioned in the women’s section above, this grippy and well-cushioned sneaker is our pick for the best trail running shoe overall. You can score the men’s version for 19% off in two colorways at the moment. Nordstrom Rack Designed for walking and running, this sneaker is breathable and super supportive without feeling overly heavy. The men’s Hoka Arahi 6 is currently on sale in three colorways, though the pictured combination has the widest selection of sizes. Dick's Sporting Goods The sneaker has a thick lug sole that’s extra grippy on the pavement and great for trail running. If you like the blue-and-yellow colorway above, it’s currently on sale for 25% off when you add the shoe to your cart. (This style is also on sale in two other colorways directly from Hoka for a slightly lesser discount. ) Nordstrom Rack Designed for racers, the Carbon X 3 has a meta-rocker sole for extra propulsion and a neutral, streamlined fit. This deal is currently available in two colors, both with a solid array of sizes to choose from. Hoka rarely offers sitewide sales. That said, its sale section is often stocked with older designs for as much as 40% off. You can also typically find deals on Hoka sneakers from third-party retailers like REI and Dick’s Sporting Goods. Yes, select Hoka styles have been awarded the podiatric APMA Seal of Acceptance. This means podiatrists have reviewed the shoes and agreed that a number of Hoka’s cushioned designs are beneficial to overall foot health. Our editors named the Hoka Clifton 9 sneaker the best cushioned walking shoe for women and the best men’s walking shoe for flat feet. The style is plush and supportive without feeling overly bulky. But they won’t work for everyone—the best walking shoe for you depends on a variety of factors, including how high your arches are and how you walk. For instance, we recommend skipping the Hoka Clifton 9 if you have especially narrow feet. The brand recommends replacing your Hokas between 250 and 500 miles, depending on individual wear. Pay attention to signs like increased muscle fatigue, uneven wear patterns and discomfort to identify when it’s time to trade in an older pair. Hokas have been popularized online for their outstanding comfort and support. They have a super-plush midsole that helps with shock ab... (truncated)
