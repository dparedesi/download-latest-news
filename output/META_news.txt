Following a brief but dramatic dip in late August and early September, Nvidia has rebounded sharply. The stock closed down slightly on Wednesday at $132.65, just shy of its closing high of $135.58 reached in June. Nvidia has surpassed Microsoft as the second-most valuable company, behind only Apple. Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI boom, as companies including Meta, OpenAI, Alphabet, Microsoft and Oracle continue to unveil technologies and products that require hefty investments in its graphics processing units, or GPUs. In August, Nvidia reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that showed revenue rose 122% year over year while net income more than doubled to $16.6 billion. The company also gave stronger-than-expected guidance for the current quarter and said it expects to ship several billion dollars worth of its new Blackwell AI chip. Demand is so high that Nvidia anticipates shipments for its current-generation Hopper chip to increase over the next two quarters. "We see NVDA remaining the leader in the AI training and inference chips for Data Center applications," Mizuho analysts said in a note Wednesday, estimating that the company has about 95% market share. The analysts have a $140 price target on the stock but noted risks in potentially escalating export restrictions to China, geopolitical tensions regarding Taiwan or a significant pullback in AI server spending. "Everybody wants to have the most and everybody wants to be first," CEO Jensen Huang said in an interview last week on CNBC's "Closing Bell Overtime," speaking of the "insane" demand for the Blackwell chip. Production for the GPU, which will cost between $30,000 and $40,000 per unit, is expected to ramp up in the fourth quarter and continue into fiscal 2026. The stock rallied for other reasons over the last month, too. Nvidia shares jumped 4% on Sept. 23, after a filing showed Huang finished selling the company's stock. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.

Title: Here's how I would make a dream PS5 Pro setup this Prime Day

Time Published: 2024-10-09T16:08:45Z
Full Content:
Make your PS5 setup "pro", with or without the upgraded console When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. As someone who reviews all sorts of PS5 accessories for a living, I would argue you can make a PS5 Pro setup without buying Sony's new $699 console. Sure, a new GPU that can use AI upscaling and generally fling better graphics at your display is nice, but I'd argue that quality-of-life updates through upgrading other parts of your gaming setup will make much more of a difference to you. Of course, with Prime Day PS5 deals going on at the same time as PS5 pre-orders, now is a great time to shop for either a new console or some new gaming hardware and accessories. Since I've been keeping tabs on both of these things, I thought it would be a great opportunity to sift through the digital storefronts, finding the very best PS5 accessories and upgrades. Now, I totally appreciate that if you bought all of the products in the list below, you'd probably run your bank account through the wringer, and at that point, you may even spend more than you would on a PS5 Pro. I've put together the list below because barring the TV I've picked out, I've had hands-on time with every single thing, and can attest to each one making a massive difference to my gaming time. Without further ado, here are the Prime Day deals I'd use to make a dream PS5 Pro setup. SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7P | $179.99 $109 at Amazon Save $70 - I use this headset every time I boot up the PS5, and you can get it here at its lowest-ever price. It as previously down to $125 in September, but this extra discount makes it particularly tempting. Buy it if: ✅ You want exceptional sound quality ✅ You want a simultaneous Bluetooth connection ✅ You don't use the USB-C port on your console for anything else. Don't buy it if: ❌ You want a wireless mixer Price check: Best Buy: $179.99 UK: £137.74 at Amazon If you sift through enough of my ramblings about gaming tech, you'll know that audio means a great deal to me when gaming. I'm a huge lover of video game soundtracks, and I also play a lot of Hunt: Showdown, a game where audio is paramount to success. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7P is a great headset above all, conveying sound cues accurately and balancing the varying tones of soundtracks beautifully. The other reason I love this headset though, and would recommend it at this price, is because it has simultaneous Bluetooth connectivity. That means that while your headset is connected to the PS5 or a PC through the wireless USB-C dongle, you can also connect your phone to it through Bluetooth. When you're scrolling through your phone while a game loads or you're taking a break, the audio will come through your headset at the same time. It's a huge quality-of-life feature I now don't want to go without. Corsair MP600 Elite 1TB | $99.99 $84.99 at Amazon Save $15 - If a storage upgrade would be more beneficial, this 1TB drive is the deal I'd make the most of this Prime Day. For being one of the best drives on the market, this really is a great price to pay. Buy it if: ✅ You want a top-performing SSD ✅ You need more storage space ✅ You'd like something that's simple to install Don't buy it if: ❌ You've pre-ordered the PS5 Pro Price check: Walmart: $84.99 UK: £97.99 at Amazon The PS5 Pro comes with a 2TB internal drive, which is nice, but it seems a bit pointless to me. The best SSDs for PS5 already exist, and you can usually find another 1TB drive to slot into an existing console without spending $100. The Corsair MP600 Elite is one of the first drives I'd recommend to PS5 owners this year. It outperforms the majority of other compatible options for this console, and it has one of the best integrated heatsinks I've come across. As true as that is, you can still get it for the price of the budget brands, thanks to this deal. If you just want an extra terabyte of space so you don't need to keep deleting games, this is the one I'd point you toward. If you want some serious future-proofing, on the other hand, check out the drive below. Samsung 990 Pro 4TB | $479.99 $265.99 at Amazon Save over $200 - Over $200 is a lot of money to spend on a small accessory for PS5. However, 4TB of space will last you for years to come, even if you download pretty much everything that gets added to PlayStation Plus every month. I've never seen this drive so cheap, so it's an amazing time to buy. Buy it if: ✅ You want to upgrade your storage ✅ You genuinely need 4TB ✅ You want the best SSD going Don't buy it if: ❌ You don't care about read/write speeds UK: £284.18 at Amazon The 4TB Samsung 990 Pro is the drive I use in my own console, and yes, it is arguably overkill. Still, its probably the best performing SSD out there at the moment. It's certainly the best one you can get for the PS5 because of its relentless speed. The majority of people don't actually need 4TB, but if you're building the setup of dreams, that will usually involve never needing to upgrade again. PSVR 2 | $549 $494.99 at Walmart Save $100 - I wasn't sure we'd see PSVR 2 get more price cuts this year after a big Days of Play discount brought it down by $100 during the summer. This is a really nice way to get it a bit cheaper if you missed that price though. Buy it if: ✅ You like VR gaming ✅ You have a gaming PC or PS5 ✅ You have the space to use it Don't buy it if: ❌ VR gaming makes you feel unwell Price check: Amazon: $529 | Best Buy: $549.99 UK: £495 at Amazon PSVR 2 is one of my favorite bits of gaming hardware. I know it isn't exactly a cheap upgrade for an existing PS5 owner, but it is probably one of the best ways to enjoy your console. VR gaming isn't for everyone, but this is arguably one of the best things about the PS5 because it adds a whole other layer of enjoyment to a platform that's struggled to put out first-party titles consistently. If you're at all interested in making the perfect PS5 setup, the best VR headset on the market right now has to be on your radar. GameSir G8 Galileo | $79.99 $61.59 at Amazon Save $18 - This mobile controller is more comfortable and more useful than a Backbone one. It also costs less money - especially in this deal. I'd recommend it any day of the week, but with an $18 reduction, it's even more tempting. Buy it if: ✅ You want to play PS5 Remote Play ✅ You have larger hands ✅ You want back buttons Don't buy it if: ❌ You don't have a USB-C phone UK: £59.99 at Amazon The GameSir G8 Galileo is the best mobile controller right now, and it'll save you a lot more money than if you were to buy the PlayStation Portal. I'm not sure it should be able to, but the G8 can be used for PS5 Remote Play, which is incredible for a non-officially licensed controller. If you ever take your gaming sessions on the go, the GameSir G8 Galileo is the best PS controller you had no idea existed. Victrix Pro BFG wireless controller in white | $179.99 $154.99 at Amazon Save $35 - A 20% discount is exclusive to the white colorway of this controller, but it's a total steal if you're looking for an amazingly versatile PS5 controller. Buy it if: ✅ You want extra customization options ✅ You like to swap your components around ✅ You also want a controller for PC Don't buy it if: ❌ You won't make the most of the extras Price check: Walmart: $158.49 | Best Buy: $179.99 UK: £127.39 at Amazon This is, by far and away, the best PS5 controller on the shelves right now. It's cheaper, more versatile, and offers so much more utility than any of its rivals. If you want "pro" level gameplay, a controller like this is your key to unlocking it. If you take any game seriously enough to get "sweaty" about online leaderboards, or you even want to improve your K/D ratio in a casual shooter, this gamepad will make it so much easier for you. The Victrix Pro BFG has a modular design, meaning those facial parts? They can be pulled out and flipped upside down, which puts to bed that old debate about whether offset or symmetrical thumbstick layouts are better. Enjoy what you like, and change it around depending on the game you play - the BFG will let you do whatever you like. LG OLED C4 48-inch | $1,599.99 $996.99 at Amazon Save $203 - The LG OLED C4 is one of the best gaming TVs of the year, and if you go for a smaller size, you can get it under a grand right now. These are highly coveted screens, so if you can find one discounted, don't wait around. Buy it if: ✅You want one of the latest OLED TVs ✅You need faster 120Hz visuals ✅You prioritise contrast and color Don't buy it if: ❌You’d rather find a C3 for less ❌You want a brighter mini-LED model Other available sizes: 📺42-inch - $1,096.99 $896.99 at Amazon 📺55-inch - $1,999.99 $1,296.99 at Amazon 📺65-inch - $2,699.99 $1,496.99 at Amazon 📺77-inch - $3,699.99 $2,496.99 at Amazon 📺83-inch - $5,399.99 $3.996.39 at Amazon Last, but certainly not least, is the TV I would be buying today if I didn't have a car to finish paying off. The LG OLED C4 is the latest in a long line of best gaming TV models produced by the brand. For years I've been envious of my older cousin who has had these TVs. Beyond going for silly money G Series OLEDs from LG, this is the perfect display for PS5 or PS5 Pro. 120Hz refresh rates can boost games to much smoother performance levels, 4x HDMI 2.1 ports mean you never need to swap out cables again, and a solid processor and OS make it a responsive Smart TV for viewing other content. I could honestly gush about these TVs all day long, but I don't want to delay you from buying if you can afford one, because these things go out of stock fast. While they're around, make the most of Prime Day gaming deals, Prime Day PC deals, and Prime Day Meta Quest deals. Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more Ever since playing Journey at the age of 15, I’ve been desperate to cover video games for a living. After graduating from Edinburgh Napier University with a degree in Journalism, I contributed to the Scottish Games Network and completed an Editorial Internship over at Expert Reviews. Besides that, I’ve been managing my own YouTube channel and Podcast for the last 7 years. It’s been a long road, but all that experience somehow landed me a dream job covering gaming hardware. I’m a self-confessing PlayStation fanboy, but my experience covering the larger business and developer side of the whole industry has given me a strong knowledge of all platforms. When I’m not testing out every peripheral I can get my hands on, I’m probably either playing tennis or dissecting game design for an upcoming video essay. Now, I better stop myself here before I get talking about my favourite games like HUNT: Showdown, Dishonored, and Towerfall Ascension. Location: UK Remote One of my favorite 4K gaming monitors has joined the Prime Day party, and it's wearing a glossy panel Where to buy the 30th Anniversary PS5 Slim: live updates as we wait for stock Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman line up their post-Deadpool and Wolverine "reunion" – and everyone is making the same joke GamesRadar+ is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Title: Pinterest shares target raised on positive outlook

On Wednesday, KeyBanc raised the stock price target for Pinterest Inc (NYSE: NYSE:PINS) to $45 from the previous $43, while maintaining an Overweight rating on the stock. The adjustment follows the firm's assessment that Pinterest presents significant growth potential ahead of its upcoming earnings report. The company's favorable position is attributed to multiple factors. Foreign exchange rates are seen as increasingly beneficial, user engagement remains strong, and new product developments are on the horizon. One such development, Performance+, is expected to simplify campaign management on the platform. Drawing parallels to similar offerings from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta (NASDAQ:META), the analyst anticipates that Performance+ could spur sustained growth for Pinterest over the coming years. Despite challenges in the food and beverage sector, Pinterest is expected to overcome these as it moves past the comparative period in the fourth quarter. This year also marks the first holiday season where Pinterest will benefit from monetization efforts with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google. These initiatives, combined with a disciplined approach to expenses, are projected to result in at least 300 basis points of annual margin expansion. The firm's outlook is further bolstered by the current market valuation of Pinterest shares. With the stock trading at multiples of 15.6x and 12.2x the estimated enterprise value to EBITDA for 2025 and 2026, respectively, the analyst suggests that the market may be underestimating Pinterest's growth trajectory. In other recent news, Pinterest has been the subject of several analyst reviews. Piper Sandler maintained an Overweight rating on Pinterest, emphasizing the company's potential for high-teen growth rates and margin expansion. BofA Securities also reiterated a Buy rating on Pinterest shares, highlighting the company's ongoing integration of AI technology and its potential to achieve double-digit core growth by 2025. Deutsche Bank upgraded Pinterest's stock rating from Hold to Buy, citing the potential of its affluent user base and projected a 6% compound annual growth rate for Pinterest's global monthly active users with an 18% revenue growth over the next three years. Oppenheimer initiated coverage of Pinterest with an Outperform rating, emphasizing the platform's unique position in the digital advertising space. The firm also noted Pinterest as the fastest-growing digital advertising platform. Baird reiterated an Outperform rating, focusing on the platform's potential for sustained growth in user base, engagement, and monetization. These are recent developments for Pinterest, a company that has also been working on expanding its operations. The third quarter of 2024 is expected to be the first complete quarter to reflect the revenue impact of the company's expansion efforts, which included the monetization of approximately 30 new countries through Google's platform. Pinterest's referral traffic from Amazon showed a notable increase in September, surging 148% year-over-year. The company's recent global advertising event, Pinterest Presents, showcased the platform's advancements and potential for sustained growth in user base, engagement, and monetization. Recent data from InvestingPro provides additional context to KeyBanc's optimistic outlook on Pinterest. As of the last twelve months ending Q2 2024, Pinterest's revenue grew by 16.22%, reaching $3.34 billion. This growth aligns with KeyBanc's expectations of significant potential for the company. InvestingPro Tips highlight that Pinterest's net income is expected to grow this year, supporting the analyst's projection of margin expansion. The company's strong financial position is further evidenced by the fact that it holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, potentially providing flexibility for future investments in product development and growth initiatives. It is worth noting that while Pinterest is trading at a high P/E ratio of 115.63, it's also trading at a low P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth, with a PEG ratio of 0.71. This suggests that the market may indeed be undervaluing Pinterest's growth prospects, as KeyBanc pointed out. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 12 additional tips for Pinterest, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial health and market position.

Title: Liskov’s Gun: The parallel evolution of React and Web Components – Baldur Bjarnason
URL: https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2024/liskovs-gun/
Time Published: 2024-10-09T14:03:12Z
Full Content:
Web dev at the end of the world, from Hveragerði, Iceland Because this essay is over 11 000 words long(!) I’ve made a convenience EPUB file for offline reading. (EPUB only! No PDF this time.) You can download it over on the fulfilment service I use, Lemon Squeezy, with the option to pay what you want if you feel the urge to support my writing. Paying is absolutely optional. Unless you’re like me – an “extremely online” kind of web developer – you probably don’t notice the dramas and brouhahas that erupt in the web developer community with regularity. Most of the time these flame-wars offer little of value or less in terms of technical insight and the patter of angry voices fades away before it reaches the ears of the less online. But a recent one, which began when the maintainer of the SolidJS web development framework wrote a long and very angry-sounding blog post outlining why he didn’t think web components represented the future of web development, is a little bit less usual. Not because it has staying power. It’s fading away at the same steady pace as these things usually do. It’s interesting because it touches on what I think is a genuinely interesting technical issue, but in a way that pretty much forces every reader to ignore it. Normally, these “debates” are free of useful information. Often it’s somebody railing against this or that for largely personal reasons – I’ve certainly been guilty of that. Other times the points being made on both sides are largely innocuous. The people involved just seem to be using their “outside voices”, metaphorically speaking, for no particular reason. “You should write tests!” “Yes, but you need to do it properly! Otherwise, they just get in the way!” “I AGREE BUT I PHRASE IT IN A WAY THAT MAKES ME SOUND ANGRY AT YOU BECAUSE THIS IS THE INTERNET AND I’M PROBABLY ANGRY AT SOMETHING!” It’s tiresome, especially because it’s common for this mode of debating to split people who are largely in agreement into groups that chalk each other up as assholes. The worst part being that both sides are generally true. Everybody involved had an asshole moment or two. What makes the web components debate interesting is that, this being the internet, many of the participants are behaving like assholes (though not you, dear reader, you’re one of the wonderful sensible few of the internet) while at the same time making interesting yet conflicting technical points. “These two groups seem to both be making solid technical points, and yet they end up disagreeing,” is always interesting. It means the topic has curious nuances and, possibly, unresolved hard questions. That bit is genuinely fun, at least if you’re of a personality type that finds unresolved hard questions fun. The tone and attitudes of some of the posts involved make it difficult, but discovering if there’s a “there” there can be worthwhile. But, because of the “everybody defaults to ‘asshole’” nature of social media, we often end up in a discourse archipelago where each island vehemently sticks to its opinions, never listening to the other, because most humans will resolutely ignore advice and observations if they come from somebody they consider to be an asshole. The core point of the current hubbub, if you dig through the rhetoric and follow the links back to earlier discussions and arguments is: It’s really hard to add extensibility and “composability” to an already complex class inheritance tree with pre-existing and rigidly defined composition system without making some hard compromises. But to get to that point, the point where we can dig into the technical details of the whys and wherefores, we first need to understand the context. We need to be able to look past the assholes to see the forest. We need to understand what somebody means when they say “web components”. If you aren’t directly involved in specific kinds of web development, you might not have a clear idea of what Web Components are. They are a set of web APIs that have been standardised and, for the most part, implemented by web browsers. They are a standard method for implementing and distributing reusable widgets. That’s pretty much it. There are a few features and details that surround these, help them integrate with other APIs, help smooth the edges, but this is Web Components. Together, these APIs let us build custom widgets that can be safely packaged into a custom element and will interoperate with pretty much anything that renders to a DOM, even React (though React specifically blocked custom elements for what honestly sounded like spurious reasons for the longest time and even now full support has only shipped in a beta release). Web Components aren’t what you would call a “disruptive” innovation, but they are genuinely useful. More so now they more reliably work with forms in modern browsers. They are a “hey, you know that thing browsers do? Well now you can do a little bit of that yourself” kind of extension mechanism. Slightly complicating the issue, the term tends to get reused across a few contexts. This last type of project is the one that’s of most interest to those in software development who might have to do some incidental web development. Because of how late Safari was to supporting form-associated custom elements, we’re only in the early stages of what Web Component Libraries can offer, but they have the potential to provide ready-made yet powerful and customisable widgets people could use when making websites, services, or web apps, no matter what client-side or server-side framework they’re using. Described this way, you might wonder how an otherwise innocuous set of web APIs, designed to aid in the making of reusable widgets, so consistently cause tension and conflict among web developers. So much so that it’s almost certainly a very bad idea for me to wade into it with this essay. Why do Web Components cause online web developer communities to erupt in anger and argument? To answer that, we need to go back over a decade, at least thirteen years, all the way back to 2011. The impression you’re likely to get from discussions online would be that web components were created as a reaction to the rampant growth of React-based frameworks bloating websites and breaking accessibility. You couldn’t be faulted for thinking that web component APIs came about as a proposed fix. “Stop using React and use these APIs, they come with the web!” But web components not only predate the popular misuse of React and the rise of frameworks, they arguably predate React itself. Web components surfaced to public view in 2011 in a talk at the Fronteers conference by Alex Russell. These weren’t the web components you see today as the code he was presenting was a library, not a proposed standard – that would come later – but the shape of it is extremely familiar to those who have used modern Web Components. React at this point was still an internal project at Facebook and had only been in use for a few months, if that. These were two very different approaches towards creating dynamic web-based user interfaces, and they were as good as invented simultaneously. Their launch as public projects also happened at pretty much the same time with Google’s first attempt to standardise Web Components and Facebook’s first launch of React as an open source project both happening in 2013. This was, in my personal opinion, the point where multiple schisms in web development began to happen, the break that has hindered web developer discourse since. I should emphasise here that the following description of events is my opinion only and entirely based on what I saw as an outside observer. I was not privy to any private discussions or chats. I absolutely missed out on some important context, but I can say that this is what it looked like to a lot of people at the time. I appreciate that everybody involved meant well and had good reasons for their behaviour, but people will form their opinion of you based on what they know and see, which doesn’t include the stuff they don’t know about, and especially doesn’t include the stuff you haven’t made public. People do not read between the lines on the internet. At best, they make weird shit up and pretend it’s true. Web Components at this point were, and I know quite a few people will again disagree with me, an entirely proprietary Google project, much like React was an entirely proprietary Facebook project. Web components during these first three years, the first iteration that later got called “Web Components v0”, were only ever implemented by Google, only promoted by Google, and its biggest users were Google products and frameworks. The “polyfills”, itself a term that implies inevitable standardisation, were from the perspective of everybody not using Google’s Chrome the actual implementation of Web Components. They were slow as hell. This made the overall experience of Google properties that used them, such as YouTube, noticeably worse in Firefox. Not a great look, folks! To make matters worse – and, again, this is based on my impressions at the time and I know plenty of people disagree with me – a few of the more “enthusiastic” Web Components promoters during these three years were parading around being absolute assholes, to an even greater degree than seemed normal in online developer circles. Many of them seemed to outright believe that a set of APIs made unilaterally by a single vendor would inevitably get railroaded unchanged into a standard – in and of itself a highly problematic idea – and talked about web components being “the future”, implying that every other approach, no matter how new, was “legacy” or somesuch. Remember, React and Web Components were both released at around the same time – arguably React came later – and here these dudes (almost always dudes) were strutting around calling everything else outdated and obsolete. They claimed to be the only ones properly “using the platform”. Their approach was “standard”. A “standard” implemented by a single browser, pushed by a single company, with no interest from other browsers visible to an outside observer for at least three years. This is arguably normal behaviour in tech, where a dev-rel’s thankless task of building up good vibes about an API or platform can be tanked thoroughly by a lead dev opening their mouth and managing to simultaneously piss everybody off in 140 characters dumped onto the hive of seething malice that used to be called Twitter. But, because none of us saw what may or may not have been going on behind the scenes, and because Google was even then at the very least a proto-monopolist… This all? It was not a great look! It didn’t help that React was in full promise-the-world myth-making mode. It no longer really mattered whether Web Components were superior to React or not. Web developers largely focused on React, which has always had more competent PR than most other open source projects. Another problem was that nobody else seemed to agree with Google that this specific iteration of Web Components was the future. Firefox and Safari never implemented version “zero” of Web Components. Most developers favoured React’s approach to reactive programming and composition which, arguably, became the conceptual inspiration for pretty much every reactive component framework implemented since. Everybody who adopted this version of Web Components ended up getting punished for trusting Google. To say that the Safari and Firefox teams were sceptical about web components is oversimplifying things. The template element was relatively uncontroversial compared to the rest. “Autonomous” custom elements – the ability to define brand-new elements with custom names (<my-custom-element>) – were also relatively uncontroversial. The Shadow DOM and “built-in” custom elements – letting web developers directly modify native built-in elements in situ through sub-classing – proved much more divisive. Many at the time seemed convinced that this reticence was nothing more than a form of road-blocking, that these Mozilla and Apple employees were obeying some sort of secret directive from their bosses to “slow-walk” improvements to the web, but a much simpler explanation is that their concern was genuine, because there was a lot to be concerned about. These particular changes affect the core of how the Document Object Model (DOM) works. The consequences of doing the wrong thing would be both long-lasting and far-reaching, and the web has much too many footguns already. Messing around with the composition and inheritance models of the DOM is something you should legitimately be hesitant to do. Those arguing for ill intent do have their smoking gun: Apple’s unwillingness to ship the awesome that would be built-in custom elements is, to many, clear evidence that Apple hates the web. That the rationale for doing so involved citing something so clearly bullshit-sounding as the “Liskov Substitution Principle” has frequently been mocked by web devs on social media. (Don’t laugh. Many web devs also think “Model-View-Controller”, “Separation of Concerns”, and “unit testing” sound like bullshit. The web software industry has a substantial curiosity deficit. Apologies for the “X” links, but that’s where nonsense lives, retires, and dies of old age after an active life.) But, for the purposes of this story, Liskov’s a different kind of gun: Checkov’s gun. And I’m not just saying that because I think “Liskov” sounds a bit like “Checkov” and it amuses me to link the two. This gun will be fired in the third act and not in the way the “WebKit developers hate the web” types think. It turns out the Safari team had a point. Looking from the outside in, like that creepy dude in the “Sickos” cartoon, the discussions at the time looked involved and intense. The GitHub issue with the infamous “Liskov” remark I linked to above is over 500 comments long, and it’s one of many, not to mention mailing list threads and, I presume, a bunch of calls and in person conversations. But, eventually, browser vendors settled on a design for Web Components. This “v1” of Web Components was quite incompatible with “v0”, punishing everybody who took Google at their word that their proprietary v0 would eventually become a web standard: And a bunch more changes that I won’t go into here, but suffice to say migrating from v0 to v1 was a painful process for many. Moving an existing code base that used the entire Web Component v0 stack to v1 was non-trivial. It took YouTube itself a long while to migrate. Having to drop v0 and having to redesign Web Components to address the concerns raised by Safari and Firefox did not make the more avid in the Web Components crowd humble or change their tone. If anything, from the perspective of a regular web developer (me, that is), their rhetoric seemed to escalate now they could point to Web Components being an actual standard. If you are a masochist, you should easily be able to find GitHub comments or Tweets from this period, the early years of Web Components from 2016 to 2020, where a Google employee is calling all other approaches “legacy code” or “legacy approaches” or something similar. If you were a lurker at the time in the discussion threads between them and framework implementers, you’d have noticed that their advocacy also seemed to become much more targeted. The pressure was on those making the newer web development frameworks to build them using web components, not just be compatible with them, and it looked immense. The targets of this pressure were not Facebook’s React here, but newer frameworks such as Solid and Svelte. These are made by folks that, by and large, are very much in favour of using standards if possible, whereas the React folks seem more inclined to go “meh” and do their own thing. These newer frameworks are generally much better behaved when it comes to interoperability, exposing native DOM APIs, and performance. Both Solid and Svelte even compile to Web Components meaning you can use them to implement reusable custom elements for your projects. The problem? These pro-web maintainers have differing definitions of what’s “possible” from those more avidly promoting web components. Some of that comes from the fact that Web Components seem to be largely unsuitable to implementing a functional reactive component framework, which should not be surprising since the two concepts evolved in parallel, not in sequence. It’d have been quite the coincidence if web components had happened to be a useful set of primitives for implementing something like Svelte or Solid. Quite a few of the people who build and maintain the frameworks themselves hold on to a lingering animosity because many of them feel gaslit about the capabilities of Web Components. Their perception of reality was that these standards were not useful to them at all, but the message they got – insistently – was that web components were the inevitable future of their own frameworks. This is the background that led Ryan Carniato, the author of SolidJS, to write his blog post Web Components Are Not the Future. That blog post is a reaction to a specific line of rhetoric that has gone unnoticed by most web developers because they were not the ones targeted. That’s why it looked like such an odd, angry, outburst to many and those foolish enough to support their chosen web development tech as if it were a football team took it or the reaction to it as validation that their “team” was better than the others. What’s missing from this are the reasons why React and its descendants won out over Web Components and their ecosystem. Just because you might not easily be able to use web components to implement something like SolidJS, that’s a very different kind of problem from what most regular web developers are tackling. Ryan might have a justifiable gripe against a small group of over-enthusiastic Web Components promoters, but that doesn’t answer the question that rises when you realise that React and Web Components are generationally peers – to the point of React having its first stable release in 2016 just like Web Components: Why did React win? And the answer to that, in my oh so personal opinion, isn’t “because Web Components aren’t great for specific kinds of problems, such as those framework maintainers deal with” no matter how technically reasonable that might sound. Remember, these technical observations and conclusions are popping up after React was well on its way towards resoundingly winning the popularity contest that is modern web dev. I think it comes down to a simple difference in promises. Web components promise you that you’ll be able to extend the DOM in ways that are idiomatically compatible in with the rest of the DOM. React promised us a silver bullet: unidirectional data flow would fix UI development once and for all. Magical silver bullets will always be more popular than boring old incremental improvement. React offered two benefits to organisations: Both of these promises are science-fiction, and experienced React devs as well as React maintainers are both likely to be the first to point that out. People still believed in these fictions, and many still do. Both require some explanation. React’s core innovation was to treat the UI as a virtual data structure that could be reconciled with, or rendered to, whatever stateful group of objects you were using to render the actual User Interface. This was deliberately agnostic about whether the rendering target was a Document Object Model, a hierarchy of AppKit or UIKit objects, or whatever it is that Android has got going. This meant you could structure your UI components as a set of functions or classes that together took the app’s state and returned a tree-like data structure and, because these were in theory just accepting and returning data, you could steal ideas from functional programming – immutable objects, no side effects, baby! – to make the whole process easier. Instead of complex manipulations full of potential side effects, your mental model of your GUI app would be something along the lines of: UI = f(state) Events and actions generated by the UI modify state. That triggers the f(state) part again. The data structure returned from the components is diffed with the existing UI and the UI is updated based on that diff to reflect the new state. This is what the React scene calls “unidirectional data flow” (“one-way data flow” in more recent documentation) because data only flows from state to UI, whereas the data that flows from the UI back into state is labelled “actions” or “events”, which means they aren’t data, silly. No, the data the user is typing into the form isn’t data. It’s an action. Here, read this rambling blog post and library of old-style Twitter threads that explain it. Of course, you need to be smart enough to understand that data isn’t data except when it’s data, and it’s always going in one direction except when it’s going in the other, in which case it’s a cycle, which makes it all one direction. Something about drawing it as a circle somehow makes people miss the fact that stuff is obviously flowing in multiple directions. Not just up and down, but sideways within a component and often React apps just completely drop the pretence and shove the data directly to where it belongs using things like the Context API. But, sure, the data only flows one way. You just need to have curious definitions of the words “flow”, “one”, “way”, and “data”. That, however, isn’t the problem with the idea. It’s actually a neat idea that forces you to rethink some of the basic principles of GUI software development. The problem is that it’s pretty much only an idea: a myth. What we get in practice is almost always quite different in very important ways. The issues, in no particular order: But, Baldur, you don’t understand! You don’t get React! Oh, I understand. When I use a model object that’s connected to a view object using a coordinating object (controller, presenter, or whatever), then sure that’s MVC or MVP. But, when you do it, it’s a parent component that’s using the context API and hooks to coordinate a state object with a functional child component. Effectively, as soon as you try to do meaningful work with React, the “unidirectional data flow” ceases to be an architecture and becomes an origin myth. Meanwhile the actual architecture is whatever uncoordinated “I can’t believe it’s not MVC” hocus pocus is popular in the React scene the week the project was started. For a very brief period, React’s tag line was something like “The V in MVC”, but they quickly gave that up because there’s so much more in React than just the components. They have an entire array of state and event management tools that together assemble whatever app architecture you want. React has always been the whole kit and caboodle, not just a “V”. It’s just never enforced a single, coherent architecture and instead provided hooks and tools with no direction and soft boundaries. But it promised magic, and people didn’t seem to notice that, in time, making and maintaining a React app was just as much work, if not more, as those made using more traditional approaches. Moreover, React apps that were explicitly structured using the Model-View-Controller architecture from the ground up tended to, in my personal opinion as an extremely biased outside observer, be less problematic over time than those that went all in on the unidirectional gravy train. A promise of magic is always going to be more popular than promising to give you sensible – the “wear practical shoes, it’s going to be a long walk” kind of sensible – steps forward. Even if Web Components had met with universal approval among browser vendors right out of the gate, it’s unlikely they would have ever won out over the promise of making the development of dynamic user interfaces magically easier. It should not be surprising that more modern component frameworks, ones that aren’t saddled with a largely fictional core concept, such as Vue, Svelte, or SolidJS are by almost every metric faster, lighter, and more productive than React. Preact even manages to be a far superior “React” than React itself. React has become a bloated carcass of false promises, misleading claims, and unending layers of backwards compatibility – the wrong kind of backwards compatibility, as they still occasionally break your fucking code when updating. Pretty much anything else is a better tool for pretty much any web development task. There’s also more genuinely useful innovation going on everywhere except React. SolidJS came up with signals, a genuinely interesting method for handling state. Preact adopted it and arguably came up with a more interoperable implementation of the idea. Vue and Svelte both hew closer to web norms in interesting ways. If you want innovation and experimentation, there’s a lot of it going around. Just not in React. Promises of magic only go so far. Since the consensus of the overall effect that React has had on the web is currently ranging from “on the whole, probably not great” to “the only thing that would be worse for the web would be a comet wiping out all civilisation, and even that would be a blessed relief,” if that were all, React would not be nearly as dominant in the web software industry as it still is today. That’s where commodifying developers comes in. In basic terms, what management wants is the ability to add, remove, or move around staff while pretending that said staff is largely interchangeable and that the moving around doesn’t mess things up in and of itself. This is the case for most modern companies, not just the ones in tech. Any form of expertise or specialisation makes that idea even more fictional than it already is. Employers generally love whatever scheme they find that can narrow the skill sets required to do a task down to something that can be clearly defined in market terms. One way to do that is by requiring specific degrees and certifications. Another is to standardise on using specific tools and platforms and hiring for those. You don’t try to hire people with good problem-solving skills, an ability for writing clearly, an affinity for numbers, or an understanding of how computers work that helps them pick up new apps quickly. You hire for skills in “Word” and “Excel”. That lets you hire quickly, fire quickly, and move people around as if they were, I don’t know, Legos or something. (Sorry, “Lego bricks”, he corrects himself before the pedants light their torches and grab their pitchforks.) This is hard to accomplish in software development. The entire job is basically discovering and solving poorly-defined problems with squishy human elements at its centre. React stepped in just in time to help managers en masse fake their way to a promotion during a low-interest-rate bubble. Much like “Word” and “Excel” have become the “fungibility” stand-ins for “can write clearly” and “understands numbers”, React has become a stand-in for “UI software development”. It hides the complexities of what’s happening underneath a layer of abstractions. Instead of learning a host of DOM querying and manipulation APIs or the workings of platforms like UIKit, you just return JSX. Instead of exposing the various nuances and intricacies of event handling on each platform, you get one form of event delegation and you’re going to like it. The JSX data structures are so abstracted away from the actual platform that they even offer approaches for you to pretend there isn’t any difference between a web, iOS, and Android app and let you target (or try to target) all with a single code base. React developers interact with a drastically simplified view of the world. Because that simplified view has limitations, the underlying platforms push their way into the job with alarming regularity. But because the point of hiring for React is to not hire people with the specialised skills to deal with the nuances of underlying platform, most of the time everybody reaches for a dependency instead. Something made by somebody with a deeper understanding of the underlying platform that packages up a set of solutions that those with full-on React blinkers can use. This heavy reliance on dependencies compounds React’s many pre-existing performance problems. The bloat of these web apps isn’t accidental but a by-product of how React is used by management. (I’ve written about this before, for those who are curious.) Understanding how the DOM works is a hard requirement for using tools to extend the DOM. This made Web Components a non-starter. Web Components didn’t help enable the massive growth in head count that drove much of the decision-making in tech from 2011-2022. Bear this in mind below, when I go into some of the technical limitations of Web Components. Those limitations are not the reasons why React won. React ended up the winner because it devalued software developers and made promises it could never fulfil. If that were all, then web components would just be a textbook case of over-aggressive promotion and hubris leading to self-sabotage, and a useful but limited technology losing out primarily because of the market’s many dysfunctions. Both are a regular occurrence in tech and software development. But has had other consequences. It has fractured the online web development community. The React-versus-everybody-else schism is obvious, but the other schisms are arguably more tragic. Specifically, drama surrounding Web Components and a steady parade of similar events has fractured the part of the community that is trying to get the industry to stop using what has now become the actual legacy framework: React. Instead of a united front that promotes a set of approaches as alternatives to React, each with differing optimal use cases, we now have three factions that do not collaborate nearly as much as they should: The differences between these groups are not technical. WebC and Svelte both use single file HTML components and compile to HTML, CSS, and JS, usually mediated through a chosen site generator – “meta-framework” if you will – Eleventy and SvelteKit respectively, and they both include custom elements as compile targets. Any debate that presupposes a fundamental technical difference, beyond just their relative sizes, between these two frameworks is already in the wilderness. Using Lit is not morally superior to using Vue. Different frameworks have different trade-offs and, yeah, that does mean that sometimes one is a more productive choice for a situation than the other. Sometimes that means that Lit, Eleventy with WebC, or Enhance, are the better choices. Sometimes it’s Vue, SolidJS, or Svelte. The core difference between the second and third groups is that the third group, like SolidJS for example, often tried at some point to integrate various parts of the Web Components stack into the implementation of their projects and became very frustrated with the technology and now many of them seem to be quite bitter about web components as a result. They were promised platform fundamentals that – because they were the future of frameworks – would work as building blocks of their own projects. This is a needless divide. “Use the platform” developers, web component frameworks, and modern reactive frameworks can all use and benefit from web components today. You can use a web component in Svelte and you can use Svelte to make a web component. WebC will work well using a Svelte component that has been compiled to a custom element. Those who eschew frameworks can use components made in either in their projects. Web Components, if the goal was to improve interoperability and reuse, are a smashing success. They are an incredibly useful building block for modern websites that’s only going to become more useful now that we have broader support for form-participating custom elements. Lea Verou does a good job of explaining what Web Components are good for in her own post on this topic: Frameworks already use native HTML elements in their components. Web components extend what native elements can do, and thus make crafting project-specific components easier across all frameworks (as well as no frameworks). I tried to find a better way to phrase this, but Lea already came up with the perfect framing. Most devs could just stop here, read Lea’s post, nod a few times as they scroll, and be done with it. (Though, you’re most of the way through this behemoth of an essay by now, so you might as well read i to the end.) This is how Web Components work. This is how we should be using web components and frameworks. (And, by the way, the fact that the Font Awesome people have hired her and Zach Leatherman have turned my scepticism about Web Awesome into outright enthusiasm, even if Zach isn’t involved in it directly. I’m very much looking forward to seeing what they and Font Awesome do in the future.) However, the underlying technical reasons why web components are a bad fit for some software architectures are still there, largely unexplored. I’ve had to use web components quite a bit, myself. I largely like them. I even see the appeal of the Shadow DOM, despite its many issues. I’ve used web components (no framework), Lit (a framework designed with web components in mind), and Svelte (a reactive component framework) for complex projects, and I’ve experimented with a lot of the rest with prototypes. But, in my experience, using web components, with or without Lit, to implement a big project end-to-end was usually harder and more complicated than using a reactive framework for the same purposes. It was also sometimes harder than using no framework at all. When people say “use the platform” they aren’t just talking about the handful of Web Component APIs. The platform has more to offer than Custom Elements and Shadow DOMs. Web components can be suboptimal for many projects for reasons that are very similar to the reasons why they aren’t useful for the internal implementation of frameworks like Solid or Svelte, but I can’t speak for framework implementers, only for myself. The first issue has to do with how web components interact with the rest of the Document Object Model (DOM). Every API that’s commonly bundled under the “Web Components” umbrella is defined in terms of their alterations to the DOM: Shadow DOM, custom elements, even the <template> element to some degree. Using them requires injecting them into the DOM tree at specific points. That quickly becomes problematic because the semantics of the DOM are highly dependent on specific hierarchies. The list could go on forever because this is a fundamental part of how both HTML and SVG are designed, so it’s happening throughout both. The DOM fundamentally uses hierarchy for composition. The same element will have different functionality and meaning depending on what parents it has. To use object-oriented terms, the DOM relies heavily on both composition (“X is extended by having a Y”) and inheritance (“X is extended by being a Y and inheriting its features”) in a complex system that does not easily allow for intermediaries. A list only works if the parent ordered or unordered list element is in a direct “has a” relationship with child list elements. Direct parent-child element relationships is one of the building blocks of DOM composition. Components, as an architectural concept, need to add behaviour to and render into these kinds of hierarchies without breaking their structure. Components in many reactive frameworks solve this by not injecting themselves into the DOM at all. They return elements that the rendering context will integrate into the DOM, but they generally won’t be a part of the explicit DOM hierarchy themselves. You don’t want a ListComponent to wrap the li elements it returns in <list-component> tags because that would break the semantics of the DOM. The list would no longer function as a proper list. Components in these frameworks generally exist as an abstraction outside the DOM. A rendering context takes that abstraction (often a “virtual” DOM) and render to the “actual” DOM. That many developers misuse frameworks doesn’t change the fact that modern frameworks are specifically structured around the ability to deliver semantic and accessible DOMs without breaking the parent-child composition that’s integral to modern HTML. This is React’s positive legacy to the world of web development: a way of making components that don’t interfere with the Document Object Model’s core methods for composition and extension. That positive legacy has been carried forward and improved by modern web frameworks. Once you lose the mythical “unidirectional data flow” baggage, and aren’t trying to build the universal UI engine, “return a data structure that gets diffed and merged with a corresponding part of the DOM” is actually a neat and productive idea that fits extremely well with traditional approaches to working with the DOM, such as template rendering. If you look towards approaches to state management that are more akin to the matching up of models with views through some coordination, functional reactive components actually begin to look kind of awesome. They aren’t quite the magic solution React promised, but they are a meaningful and substantial improvement. That’s where we’re at with modern frameworks. That’s what many of the Web Components frameworks are trying for as well, even though they are held back by how custom elements inevitably inject themselves into the DOM, because custom elements are defined in terms of, well, custom DOM elements. That “injection” can make the DOM dysfunctional by interfering with the hierarchy many elements require. It took years for them to finally fix some of the issues Shadow DOM has with forms, and we still occasionally have issues with it interfering with aria- property references, which are used to properly expose the UI to accessibility tools, and labelling across components. How selection APIs interact with Shadow DOMs are still a mess (though hopefully not for long). Custom elements can’t easily be used to render list or table child elements directly. They don’t work at all for extending SVG, which is the only vector drawing surface available to the broader web. Even if you pretend Safari doesn’t exist and just look at Firefox’s progress, their support for form-associated elements was released in 2021, five years after the “v1” release of web components. It’s been a long road. These standards seem legitimately hard to implement, which is what you’d expect once you realise they’re messing with some of the core structures of the web platform. This issue with hierarchical interjection is why you occasionally hear framework types say that web components should mostly be used as “leaf nodes”. If the web component has no children visible to the framework – is a “leaf” not a branch – then it can’t break the hierarchy. It’s a useful rule of thumb if you’re working in the framework world and fits well with how Lea Verou defined the relationship between web components and frameworks in the post I quoted above. The CSS property display: contents; also goes some way to alleviate this issue as it can be used to effectively “disappear” the custom element from the rendering tree, so it doesn’t interfere with, for example, the parent-child relationship between a <ul> and <li> element. This doesn’t address the SVG gap, but if that ends up being the only big issue remaining, then Web Components are in much better shape than many expected they’d ever be in. But, we’re still missing the ability to create custom elements that extend built-in elements. That would be the last remaining issue to solve and would let you deliver web components that render elements like <li> or <td> without interfering with the hierarchy. It is the key to perfecting web components and bringing about the future we were promised. Or is it? There’s reason to believe that the Safari team might be have been right to refuse to implement the is attribute and not let custom elements extend built-ins. When you work with markup, hierarchy can serve as a very powerful form of composition. But, as I outlined earlier, that hasn’t worked too well for custom elements until fairly recently. In practice, their inclusion in the DOM hierarchy often interferes with the composition of built-in elements with little benefit to the custom element itself. Beyond that, there’s a tension inherent in how custom elements were designed. They are simultaneously late- and early bound. They are dynamically late-bound to an element name, <my-custom-element> for example, that then automatically works in the markup and DOM. A script can define a custom element with any valid name it wants. A component or function that renders HTML doesn’t need to import that script directly or have any knowledge of the custom element. The developer can change the composition of a DOM tree simply by mapping a different custom element implementation to that name. The communication between the custom element and its surrounding context is done through messages – events – attributes, and object properties. None of the elements in the surrounding context need to even be aware that the implementation of the custom element has been switched to a different one. This is a form of late binding, or loose coupling, and late-binding is extremely useful for building applications with user interfaces because it lends itself to building complex functionality through composition without, well, binding you to a rigid structure that can be hard to alter as the design realities of the interface are surfaced. You can still easily modify the project as the app gets tested and user feedback pours in. As Alan Kay explained: Late binding allows ideas learned late in project development to be reformulated into the project with exponentially less effort than traditional early binding system. This is a good thing. At the same time, the implementation of custom elements is based on highly specific inheritance that can’t be easily remapped. If you’re rendering in a browser, the HTMLElement class is always going to be HTMLElement. Even though you can technically replace it – JavaScript is a late-bound language as designed – doing so risks breaking the DOM entirely. That means that the implementation and state management of a web component is tightly coupled to its ancestor classes and that will generally make reformulations and alterations harder. Moreover, the DOM’s existing class inheritance tree was not made with web developer subclassing in mind. Its inheritance is complicated and a mess. A few elements actually share interfaces, such as the <q> and <blockquote> elements sharing the HTMLQuoteElement interface and a whole mess of legacy elements sharing the HTMLUnknownElement interface. This complicates matters. Extending built-in elements also has an extremely controversial history and frameworks messing around with built-in language objects, such as Array, have directly hindered platform development and standardisation multiple times in the past. But subclassing those should be fine, right? The subclasses should break anything, right? Well, this is where Liskov’s Gun goes “blam!” because the answer to that is “probably not”. Let’s look at the Liskov substitution principle itself, the one cited by that WebKit developer all those years ago: Subtype Requirement: Let ⁠ ϕ ( x ) ⁠ be a property provable about objects ⁠ x ⁠ of type T. Then ⁠ ϕ ( y ) ⁠ should be true for objects ⁠ y ⁠ of type S where S is a subtype of T. Well that clears that right up! So clear. So obvious. That doesn’t sound like gobbledygook to regular humans at all! Effectively, paraphrasing the above-linked Wikipedia page into human(ish) terms, what it means is that if S is a subclass of T objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S without altering the correctness of the program. That is, if you subclass HTMLInputElement, instances of your subclass need to work correctly whenever they’re substituted for an instance of the original HTMLInputElement and, because JavaScript as a language isn’t really able to offer any such guarantee, this principle can’t easily be enforced in the browser runtime. So, you’re left with debating the principle itself, which is an argument that can definitely be made on an abstract level, but once you narrow it down to DOM elements specifically, I think the overall principle becomes quite compelling. Remember the section above about how the DOM uses hierarchy (“has a” relationships) for composition? How elements such as <table>, <li>, and <input> to name a few, need specific parent-child relationships to function properly? Well, the built-in subclasses that provide the interfaces these elements use are an important part of making that composition work. One of the more important uses cases for web components is to let people implement and distribute reusable widget that are interoperable across multiple projects, frameworks, or even organisations. Much of the standardisation work surrounding web components has been towards ensuring that these packaged widgets don’t interfere with the outside DOM and that they won’t be interfered with by it in return. That’s what the Shadow DOM is for. Because of this, you can take a <custom-date-picker> widget and include it in your project without much worry, provided you aren’t using it to wrap elements that require a direct parent-child relationship with specific other elements to work. Now that we have broad support for form-associated elements, this mostly works and provides a good foundation for interesting projects such as a new generation of open source widget libraries. But if you take an <input is="custom-date-picker"> element, you don’t have the same assurances. You don’t know whether you can actually use it in all the same ways you can use a regular input element. JavaScript can’t offer you that guarantee. Remember that every built-in custom element begins life as their original parent class before they get upgraded by the custom element script, so it could start off being compatible but then suddenly become incompatible when a script loads. Seen from this perspective, broad adoption of custom elements that extend built-in elements does seem likely to cause serious and hard-to-solve bugs in a non-trivial proportion of the projects who would use them. Or, in the words of Ryosuke Niwa, the WebKit dev who originally cited the Liskov substitution principle, writing on the topic eight years ago: One fundamental problem is that subclassing a subclass of HTMLInputElement or HTMLImageElement often leads to a violation of the Liskov substitution principle over time. Because they’re builtin elements, they’re very likely to be extended in the future. Imagine that we had this feature supported before type=date was added. Then your subclass of HTMLInputElement must also support type=date in order to satisfy the substitution principle. Similarly, imagine we had added this feature before srcset was added to HTMLImageElement and you wrote a subclass of HTMLImageElement. Then not supporting srcset results in the violation of the principle again. In addition, none of the builtin elements are designed to be subclassed, and in fact, we don’t have builtin subclasses of HTMLElement that are also builtins. This limits the usefulness of any sort of subclassing. Furthermore, we don’t have any hooks for the processing models and internal states of builtin elements such as the dirtiness of HTMLImageElement’s value and when and how HTMLInputElement picks the appropriate image. I mean, yeah. When it’s put this way, it does sound problematic. Overall, class inheritance versus composition is a classic question of trade-offs in software development and in software with graphical user interfaces – especially web-based ones – I’d argue that inheritance is the wrong trade-off for this task in particular because it’s interfering with an already complex inheritance system, which in turn can complicate even further how custom elements interact with the hierarchical composition of markup. Reactive components, as implemented by most modern frameworks, make a different trade-off. They tend to be functional, even if they aren’t implemented as functions. They still inherit React’s issue of only working when rendered to a DOM with all the side effects that entails, but because most of them are thinner abstractions than React and target fewer platforms, I’d argue that the issue has become more manageable. You render to a DOM element and test that element as a data structure. With React you often don’t even know if the final target is a DOM element, HTML string, Android view, or UIKit view. Instead of the subclasses you have to deal with in Web Components, you often have a series of function invocations that treat the returned DOM representation as, ideally, side-effect-free data they can modify and pass on. Immutable data structures are popular in among this crowd for good reasons. The representation that’s returned usually isn’t an actual DOM fragment, but gets resolved and rendered into the “real” DOM by a rendering context. To quote Mayank I can create an <Input> primitive component that wraps an <input> element. And I can create a <ThemedInput> component that wraps the primitive <Input>. Then someone else can take my <ThemedInput> and create a <PasswordInput> on top of it. After all of these components are resolved and initialized, the final DOM tree should really only contain a single <input> element. The intermediate components are not (always) relevant for the DOM tree. The browser doesn’t care how the code on my website is organized. In other words, components are totally made up. That doesn’t mean components are not useful; just that they exist in a different plane. This is what makes it possible to compose all the way up to a <Page> component Trying to accomplish this with web components is tricky and the end result is usually a deeply nested tree of custom elements. You can hide some of that in Shadow DOMs but that introduces a new set of problems caused by the Shadow DOM itself. Using web components as native-like components that are entirely external to the rendering process bypasses this in part, but if you are authoring the “leaf” web components yourself, I’d argue that the emphasis on inheritance and de-emphasis of composition will make the creation of complex widgets harder and more error-prone than it would be with a framework’s component system. The interoperability benefits and the fact you’re building with web standards, which generally do not change once they’ve been shipped across multiple browsers, gives you stability and should lower development costs in the long run. For many, if not most, organisations this trade-off should be worthwhile. But there’s a good chance that using web components to implement the core architecture of your app could make the task harder. You’re likely to have to lean heavily on inheritance and classes and eschew composition for implementing the logic and flow of the application. It absolutely can be done, either by minimising your use of class inheritance or by being thoughtful about it, but one of the reasons why reactive component frameworks, even though all the modern ones are considerably younger than web components as a technology, are so popular among devs, even the developers that don’t have to use React for organisational or political reasons, is that their architecture makes these tasks a little bit simpler. Interlocking functional components that use signals for state, for example, are easier to use and reason about than interlocking class-based web components that use properties and events for state and reactivity. This does not matter that much if the web component is a “leaf” node, the last stop on the line so to speak, but it begins to matter a lot if these components are being use throughout an app’s overall structure. Thankfully, you don’t have to use a framework to get these features. You can write functional components that use signals for reactive state using either standalone lit-html or uhtml tagged template libraries. You don’t need the full framework baggage. Some frameworks, such as Enhance offer similar capabilities that are functional and reactive out of the box. We have a spectrum of options that range from using only platform APIs, to specialised libraries, to lightweight frameworks, and all the way to fully-fledged “batteries included” web development frameworks. One size very much does not fit all. We should feel free to choose the toolset that’s appropriate for our task and our project. We should not saddle ourselves with unnecessary work out of habit or misplaced loyalties towards one “team” or another. And none of us should be using React. Web components don’t really work for quite a few of the tasks we were initially told they would be good for. Pointing that out isn’t a criticism of the web as a platform. Nor does it imply that you should always use a framework or that you can’t get anything done using just platform APIs with a small selection of libraries. All it means is that this particular slice of the web platform turned out to have limitations we need to be mindful of when we do our work. Given the limitations I went into above, it doesn’t surprise me that many framework implementers found it hard or impossible to use web components to implement a framework for reactive functional components. There’s a clear mismatch there. It also casts some light on what framework maintainers mean when they say that Web Components are a bad direction for web development. If web components, specifically, represent the future of web development, then it’s a future filled with awkward class inheritance hierarchies, even deeper markup hierarchies, and layers of code whose only purpose it is to mitigate how custom elements and the Shadow DOM interfere with regular HTML and SVG composition. It’s a vision of a future where web development is substantially harder, less powerful, and less productive. Fortunately, I don’t think that’s a future anybody wants or is even working towards. Web Components are great for what they are, genuinely great, but they don’t represent the extent or promise of the platform. There’s so much more happening. Recent additions to the web platform are squarely aimed at a much brighter future, one that helps developers implement great experiences without sacrificing usability, performance, or accessibility. That’s just to name a few and does not even begin to go into the many potential future standards that might improve things even further. Web standardisation today is in a much better place than it was a few years ago and instead of pushing the web harder in the direction of web components, most people seem content to sand off their rough edges and make them work better with the rest of the platform, using features such as Declarative Shadow DOM and ElementInternals. We’re letting web components “be their best selves”. Over time, these improvements to the platform might together change how we do web development in meaningful ways: It’s increasingly popular to rail against the existence of web apps. People get angry about how much crap gets loaded into your average website. The web is filled with ads and tracking software that are making it less and less usable. Quite a few sites are also implemented using bloated frameworks that would be barely acceptable if they were being used to implement a revolutionary killer app but are completely beyond the pale for building a regular website or dashboard. The web is a mess that seems to only be getting less usable and messier by the minute. You’d be justified in dismissing the entire concept of web apps: Websites don’t need this. This is all bullshit. But none of the tech I’ve discussed is really to blame for what has happened to the web. That lies squarely with advertising as a business model and React’s unique dysfunctions. Web Components, new web APIs, and newer more modern frameworks of every kind represent our path out of the web crisis and shouldn’t be rejected just because they involve JavaScript. This isn’t just a question of fixing web’s current issues. We need web apps. We both need more web apps, and we need more capable web apps. Mainstream Operating Systems – Android, ChromeOS, Windows, macOS, iOS, and the rest – are increasingly closed platforms whose primary software markets are managed through conservative and puritanical central committees: their hidebound App Stores. The platforms themselves are constantly shifting and changing depending on what fad the OS vendor is chasing to boost its stock price. For example, many iOS app developers sacrifice months of every year updating their apps to keep up with platform changes. If they don’t, they lose customers because their apps are broken or perceived to be broken. These are months they could be using to implement genuine improvements to their apps and to build their businesses. Those businesses can only use the specific business models approved by a platform’s central committee, are only allowed to include the content deemed morally appropriate by that central committee, and need to have every update and minute elements of its marketing strategy approved by faceless serfs working in a soul-draining bureaucracy. More importantly, these institutions also do not stand up to authoritarian powers. They will bow down to the demands of China, and they will not stand in the way of an authoritarian takeover of a democratic country. We need web apps. Web apps are the only open and standardised GUI software development and distribution platform that’s available to us. Discarding them out of spite or annoyance is exactly the sort of situation that the phrase “don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater” was coined for. We need this. And, thankfully, web standards are slowly but surely stepping up. Now we only need to make sure that OS vendors, such as Google or Apple, don’t stand in its way. And we need to make sure we don’t stand in its way.

Title: Boeing Strike, Nvidia Highs And FOMC Minutes

TOPSHOT - Union members react as Aerospace Machinists District 751 President Jon Holden (out of ... [+] frame) announces that union members rejected a proposed Boeing contract and will go on strike, following voting results at their union hall in Seattle, Washington, on September 12, 2024. Boeing workers in the Seattle region overwhelmingly voted to strike on September 12, rejecting a contract the embattled aviation giant characterized as a boon for staff given the company's stressed financial condition. (Photo by Jason Redmond / AFP) (Photo by JASON REDMOND/AFP via Getty Images) Key Takeaways Stocks staged broad rallies on Tuesday with the S&P 500 jumping nearly 1% and Nasdaq Composite gaining 1.45% Small cap stops were flat on the day and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3%. Markets have been swayed a bit by activity in China where some mixed messaging from the government has caused wide swings in prices. After recently announcing aggressive stimulus measures that boosted stock prices, many expected a furthering of those plans this week. However, when Chinese authorities hosted a press conference Tuesday, hopes for yet more stimulus were dashed. A couple weeks ago I made the comment that it felt as if China was throwing everything, including the kitchen sink, at their economy. The failure to announce any additional plans on Tuesday brings up concerns that China is running out of options. This is still an evolving story and one worth monitoring as it could have implications for U.S. markets. Back here at home, there are a few stocks I'll be following today. Boeing announced it was breaking off talks with its machinist union. The company withdrew its most recent offer to raise wages by 30% and as of now, there are no plans to restart the negotiations. In the wake of the contract negotiations breakdown, S&P Global Ratings said it may lower its rating on Boeing bonds to junk status which would likely be a significant blow to the company whose stock is already down around 40% for the year. Shares of Google parent company, Alphabet are lower by 0.5% in premarket. The Department of Justice (DOJ) announced they may seek to have the company broken up, alleging the current structure creates a monopoly. This is an interesting story not just in terms of what happens to Alphabet, but also, what type of precedent this may set for other companies, some of which comprise the Magnificent Seven. Should the company be broken apart, I would not be surprised if it spurred activity around companies such as Meta or even Apple. The question I would have is whether those companies seek spinoffs before possibly being forcibly broken apart, or if the companies would instead fight the DOJ. I actually believe these types of breakups, although disruptive in the short term, can have potential to benefit shareholders, so it is something to keep an eye on. Constellation Energy has seen its stock surge nearly 80% since early August. While we don't typically think of energy stocks as exciting, the sector is in play because of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The computing power for AI and energy required is creating a lot of interesting activity in the sector. In addition to established players in the field, new entrants are also emerging. Companies such as Oklo Incorporated, whose stock has more than doubled from a low of $5.35 just last month, are drawing attention to a sector not typically considered as high growth. Speaking of AI, chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor reported strong earnings overnight. That stock is indicated higher by just under 1% in premarket. The positive news also has shares of Nvidia indicated higher by 1% and trading at a new all-time high. We'll see if a breakout to new highs has the ability to excite the broader market as well. For today, in addition to the stocks mentioned above, I am particularly interested in the release of the most recent Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes from last month's reading. As I mentioned on Monday, given the magnitude of the cut to interest rates but continued indication of strength in the economy, I think these minutes will garner more scrutiny than we typically see. I also think the minutes will give some context to tomorrow's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report and Friday's Producer Price Index (PPI). Friday will also be the start to earnings season with both JP Morgan and Wells Fargo scheduled to report.

Title: Evercore ISI stock rated Outperform on Amazon amid Kuiper costs
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/evercore-isi-stock-rated-outperform-on-amazon-amid-kuiper-costs-93CH-3655418
Time Published: 2024-10-09T12:15:51Z
Full Content:
On Wednesday, Evercore ISI maintained a positive outlook on Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares, reiterating an Outperform rating and a $240.00 price target. The firm's analysis highlights the impending launch of satellites for Amazon's Project Kuiper, which is set to start in the fourth quarter. Project Kuiper is Amazon's initiative to provide satellite-based Internet service, and it has garnered attention due to its significant investment and potential impact on the company's financials. According to Evercore ISI, Amazon has committed $10 billion to the project and is estimated to spend over $10 billion on 94 planned launches over the next two years. The analyst anticipates Kuiper-related losses to increase substantially in the December quarter, estimating a jump from roughly $250 million in the second quarter to between $600 million and $1 billion. This projection leads to the belief that current Street Operating Income estimates for the fourth quarter may be overly optimistic. Looking ahead to 2025, the firm estimates that losses for Kuiper could soar to between $5 billion and $6 billion before the project starts generating substantial revenue. Despite these significant costs, Evercore ISI suggests that the market opportunity for Kuiper could be undervalued. The firm points to the rapid revenue growth of similar services, like Starlink, and the attractive economics of the satellite Internet segment, which boasts EBITDA margins of 30%-50% among existing competitors. Evercore ISI also notes Amazon's competitive advantages, such as its strong consumer presence and the extensive ground infrastructure provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). The firm posits that even a 1% penetration of Amazon's Global Prime member base could translate to almost $750 million in annual revenue for Kuiper. Additionally, the firm expects Amazon to reveal improvements in core U.S. Retail margins during the Kuiper investment phase, which could mitigate some investor concerns regarding the project's costs. In other recent news, Cantor Fitzgerald has raised its price target for Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) to $670, maintaining an Overweight rating based on anticipated surpassing of third-quarter earnings and fourth-quarter guidance. The firm's optimism stems from strong advertising checks and potential growth from features like Reels, A+, and personalized recommendations. Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's antitrust lawsuit against Amazon will proceed, despite Amazon's request for dismissal. The core allegations involve anti-competitive tactics and an algorithm that allegedly inflated prices for U.S. consumers. TD Cowen has maintained its Buy rating on Amazon shares, projecting a 10.7% year-over-year increase in third-quarter revenue growth, primarily driven by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and advertising revenues. Similarly, Mizuho Securities has reiterated an Outperform rating on Amazon, with a price target of $240.00, citing increased investment estimates in AWS and a revised upward spending forecast. Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) Automotive, backed by Amazon, has revised its full-year production forecast downward due to a parts shortage. The company now anticipates producing between 47,000 and 49,000 vehicles for the year, a reduction from the previously projected 57,000 units. As Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) embarks on its ambitious Project Kuiper, InvestingPro data provides additional context to the company's financial position. Despite the anticipated losses from the satellite project, Amazon's revenue growth remains robust, with a 12.32% increase over the last twelve months to $604.33 billion. This growth underscores the company's ability to invest in future technologies while maintaining its core business strength. An InvestingPro Tip highlights that Amazon is trading at a low P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth, with a PEG ratio of 0.19. This suggests that the market may not be fully pricing in the company's growth potential, including the long-term benefits of Project Kuiper. Additionally, Amazon's strong return over the last five years, as noted in another InvestingPro Tip, indicates a track record of successful long-term investments. While the Kuiper project will undoubtedly impact Amazon's financials, the company's operating income margin of 9.0% and EBITDA of $104.05 billion over the last twelve months demonstrate its current profitability. This financial cushion may help Amazon weather the initial investment phase of Project Kuiper. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 12 additional tips for Amazon, providing deeper insights into the company's financial health and market position.

Title: YieldMax™ ETFs Announces Distributions on BABO (69.59%), MRNY (61.51%), FBY (58.57%), YMAX (60.44%), YMAG (76.46%) and Others

October 09, 2024 06:55 ET | Source: YieldMax YieldMax CHICAGO and MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, Oct. 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax™ today announced distributions for the YieldMax™ ETFs listed in the table below. The performance data quoted above represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost and current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted above. Performance current to the most recent month-end can be obtained by calling (833) 378-0717. Note: DIPS, FIAT, CRSH and YQQQ are hereinafter referred to as the “Short ETFs”. Distributions are not guaranteed. The Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield are not indicative of future distributions, if any, on the ETFs. In particular, future distributions on any ETF may differ significantly from its Distribution Rate or 30-Day SEC Yield. You are not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from period to period and may be zero. Accordingly, the Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield will change over time, and such change may be significant. Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s). * The inception date for PLTY is October 7, 2024. 1 All YieldMax™ ETFs shown in the table above (except YMAX and YMAG) have a gross expense ratio of 0.99%. YMAX and YMAG have a Management Fee of 0.29% and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses of 0.99% for a gross expense ratio of 1.28%. “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses” are indirect fees and expenses that the Fund incurs from investing in the shares of other investment companies, namely other YieldMax™ ETFs. 2 The Distribution Rate shown is as of close on October 8, 2024. The Distribution Rate is the annual distribution rate an investor would receive if the most recent distribution, which includes option income, remained the same going forward. The Distribution Rate is calculated by annualizing an ETF’s Distribution per Share and dividing such annualized amount by the ETF’s most recent NAV. The Distribution Rate represents a single distribution from the ETF and does not represent its total return. Distributions may also include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gain, and return of investor capital, which may decrease an ETF’s NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. These Distribution Rates may be caused by unusually favorable market conditions and may not be sustainable. Such conditions may not continue to exist and there should be no expectation that this performance may be repeated in the future. 3 The 30-Day SEC Yield represents net investment income, which excludes option income, earned by such ETF over the 30-Day period ended September 30. 2024, expressed as an annual percentage rate based on such ETF’s share price at the end of the 30-Day period. 4 Each ETF’s strategy (except those of the Short ETFs) will cap potential gains if its reference asset’s shares increase in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset’s shares decrease in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. Each Short ETF’s strategy will cap potential gains if its reference asset decreases in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset increases in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. 5 As of the date hereof, distributions for the following ETFs have included return of investor capital: TSLY, OARK, APLY, AMZY, NVDY, GOOY, JPMO, XOMO, PYPY, CONY, DISO, FBY, MSFO, NFLY, SQY, AMDY, MRNY, AIYY, MSTY, ULTY, YMAX, YMAG, YBIT, SNOY, CRSH and GDXY. For additional information, please visit www.YieldMaxETFs.com/TaxInfo. Each Fund has a limited operating history and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Standardized Performance For YMAX, click here. For YMAG, click here. For TSLY, click here. For OARK, click here. For APLY, click here.

There is no guarantee that any Fund’s investment strategy will be properly implemented, and an investor may lose some or all of its investment in any such Fund. Tidal Financial Group is the adviser for all YieldMax™ ETFs and ZEGA Financial is their sub-adviser. THE FUND, TRUST, AND SUB-ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERENCE ASSET. Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs) YMAX and YMAG generally invest in other YieldMax™ ETFs. As such, these two Funds are subject to the risks listed in this section, which apply to all the YieldMax™ ETFs they may hold from time to time. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer time periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTY), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: The securities underlying BABO and TSMY are American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”). Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer time periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared ("cleared derivatives"). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house ("clearing members") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given time period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

Title: OpenAI Is A Bad Business

Full Content:
OpenAI, a non-profit AI company that will lose anywhere from $4 billion to $5 billion this year, will at some point in the next six or so months convert into a for-profit AI company, at which point it will continue to lose money in exactly the same way. Shortly after this news broke, Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati resigned, followed by Chief Research Officer Bob McGrew and VP of Research, Post Training Barret Zoph, leaving OpenAI with exactly three of its eleven cofounders remaining. This coincides suspiciously with OpenAI's increasingly-absurd fundraising efforts, where (as I predicted in late July) OpenAI has raised the largest venture-backed fundraise of all time $6.6 billion— at a valuation of $157 billion. Yet despite the high likelihood of the round's success, there are quite a few things to be worried about. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Apple is no longer in talks to join the round, and while one can only speculate about its reasoning, it's fair to assume that Apple (AAPL), on signing a non-disclosure agreement, was able to see exactly what OpenAI had (or had not) got behind the curtain, as well as its likely-grim financial picture, and decided to walk away. Nevertheless, both NVIDIA (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) are both investing, with Microsoft, according to the Wall Street Journal, pushing another $1 billion into the company — though it's unclear whether that's in real money or in "cloud credits" that allow OpenAI to continue using Microsoft's cloud. Yet arguably the most worrying sign is that SoftBank's Vision Fund will be investing $500 million in OpenAI. While it might seem a little weird to be worried about a half-billion dollar check, SoftBank — best-known for sinking $16 billion or more into WeWork and getting swindled by its founder, and dumping a further €900m into Wirecard, which turned out to be an outright fraud, with one founder now a fugitive from justice in Russia — is some of the dumbest money in the market, and a sign that any company taking it is likely a little desperate. While SoftBank has had a number of hits — NVIDIA, ARM and Alibaba, to name a few — it is famous for piling cash into terrible businesses, like Katerra (a construction company that died despite a $2 billion investment in 2021) and Zume Pizza (a robotic pizza company with a product that never worked that closed after raising more than $400 million, with $375 million coming from SoftBank). In any case, OpenAI will likely prevail and raise this round from a cadre of investors that will have to invest a minimum of $250 million to put money behind a company that has never turned a profit, that has no path to profitability, and has yet to create a truly meaningful product outside of Sam Altman's marketing expertise. This round is a farce — a group delusion, one borne of one man's uncanny ability to convince clueless idiots that he has some unique insight, despite the fact that all signs point to him knowing about as much as they do, allowing him to prop up an unsustainable, unprofitable and directionless blob of a company as a means of getting billions of dollars of equity in the company — and no, I don't care what he says to the contrary. Last week, the New York Times reported that OpenAI would lose $5 billion in 2024 (which The Information had estimated back in July), and that the company expected to raise the price of ChatGPT's premium product to $44-a-month over the next five years, and intended to increase the price of ChatGPT to $22-a-month by the end of 2024, a pale horse I've warned you of in the past. Interestingly (and worryingly), the article also confirms another hypothesis of mine — that "fund-raising material also signaled that OpenAI would need to continue raising money over the next year because its expenses grew in tandem with the number of people using its products" - in simpler terms, that OpenAI will likely raise $6.5 billion in funding, and then have to do so again in short order, likely in perpetuity. The Times also reports that OpenAI is making estimates that I would describe as "fucking ridiculous." OpenAI's monthly revenue hit $300 million in August, and the company expects to make $3.7 billion in revenue this year (the company will, as mentioned, lose $5 billion anyway), yet the company says that it expects to make $11.6 billion in 2025 and $100 billion by 2029, a statement so egregious that I am surprised it's not some kind of financial crime to say it out loud. For some context, Microsoft makes about $250 billion a year, Google about $300 billion a year, and Apple about $400 billion a year. To be abundantly clear, as it stands, OpenAI currently spends $2.35 to make $1. OpenAI loses money every single time that somebody uses their product, and while it might make money selling premium subscriptions, I severely doubt it’s turning a profit on these customers, and certainly losing money on any and all power users. As I've said before, I believe there's also a subprime AI crisis brewing because OpenAI's API services — which lets people integrate its various models into external products — is currently priced at a loss, and increasing prices will likely make this product unsustainable for many businesses currently relying on these discounted rates. As I've said before, OpenAI is unprofitable, unsustainable and untenable in its current form, but I think it's important to explain exactly how untenable it is, and I'm going to start with a few statements: And, fundamentally, I can find no compelling evidence that suggests that OpenAI will be able to sustain this growth. In fact, I can find no historical comparison, and believe that OpenAI's growth is already stumbling. Let's take a look, shall we? To do this right, we have to lay out exactly how OpenAI makes money. According to the New York Times, OpenAI expects ChatGPT to make about $2.7 billion in revenue in 2024, with an additional $1 billion coming from "other businesses using its technology." Let's break this down. As a result of these numbers, I have major concerns about the viability of OpenAI's business, and the generative AI market at large. If OpenAI — the most prominent name in all of generative AI — is only making a billion dollars a year from this, what does that say about the larger growth trajectory of this company, or actual usage of generative AI products? I'll get to that in a bit. First, we've gotta talk about the dollars. So, as it stands, OpenAI makes the majority — more than 70% — of its revenue from selling premium access to ChatGPT. A few weeks ago, The Information reported that ChatGPT Plus had "more than 10 million paying subscribers," and that it had 1 million more that were paying for "higher-priced plans for business teams." As I've laid out above, this means that OpenAI is making about $200 million a month from consumer subscribers, but "business teams" is an indeterminate split between teams ($25-a-user-a-month paid annually) and enterprise (at least $60-a-user-a-month, paid annually, with a minimum of 150 seats). One important detail: 100,000 of the 1 million business customers are workers at management consultancy PwC, which has also become OpenAI's "first partner for selling enterprise offerings to other businesses." It isn't clear whether these are enterprise accounts or teams accounts, or whether PwC is paying full price (I'd wager it isn’t). Here’s how this would play out in revenue terms across several assumed divisions of the customer base, and an assumption that every Teams customer is paying $27.5 (that plan costs either $25 or $30, depending on whether you pay monthly or yearly, but for the sake of fairness, I went with the middle ground). From there, we can run some hypothetical monthly revenue numbers based on a million "higher-priced plans for business teams." Sadly, I don't think things are that good, and I honestly don't think these would be particularly-impressive numbers to begin with. We can actually make a more-precise estimate by working backwards from the New York Times' estimates. ChatGPT Plus has 10 million customers, making OpenAI around $2.4 billion dollars a year (ten million users spending $20 each month equates to $200 million. Multiply that by 12, you get $2.4 billion). This means that business users make up about $300 million a year in revenue, or $25 million a month. That is, to be frank, extremely bad. These are estimates, but even if they were doubled, these would not be particularly exciting numbers. For all the excitement about OpenAI's revenue — putting aside the fact that it spends $2.35 to make $1 — the majority of the money it makes is from subscriptions to ChatGPT Plus for consumers, though one can fairly say there are professionals that use it under the consumer version too. While 10 million paying subscribers might seem like a lot, "ChatGPT" is effectively to generative AI what "Google" is to search. Ten million people paying for this is table stakes. OpenAI has been covered by effectively every single media outlet, is mentioned in almost every single conversation about AI (even when it's not about generative AI!), and has the backing and marketing push of Microsoft and the entirety of Silicon Valley behind it. ChatGPT has over 200 million weekly users, and the New York Times reports that OpenAI has "350 million people use [OpenAI's] services each month as of June" (though it's unclear if that includes those using the API). Collectively, this means that OpenAI — the most popular company in the industry — can only convert about 3% of its users. This might be because it's not obvious why anyone should pay for a premium subscription. Paying for ChatGPT Plus doesn't dramatically change the product, nor does it offer a particularly-compelling new use case for anyone other than power users. As a company, OpenAI is flat-out terrible at product. While it may be able to attract hundreds of millions of people to dick around with ChatGPT (losing money with every prompt), it's hard to convert them because you have to, on some level, show the user what ChatGPT can do to get them to pay for it… and there isn't really much you can charge for, other than limiting how many times they can use it. And, if we're honest, it still isn't obvious why anyone should use ChatGPT in the first place, other than the fact everybody is talking about it. You can ask it to generate something — a picture, a few paragraphs, perhaps a question — and at that point say "cool" and move on. I can absolutely see how there are people who regularly use ChatGPT's natural language prompts to answer questions that they can't quite phrase (a word that's on the tip of their tongue, a question they're not sure how to phrase, or to brainstorm something) but beyond that, there really is no "sticky" part of this product beyond "a search engine that talks back to you." That product is extremely commoditized. The free version of ChatGPT is effectively identical to the free version of Anthropic's Claude, Meta's AI assistant, Microsoft's Copilot, and even Twitter's "Grok." They all use similar training data, all give similar outputs, and are all free. Why would you pay for ChatGPT Plus when Meta or Microsoft will give you their own spin on the same flavor? Other than pure brand recognition, what is it that ChatGPT does that Copilot (powered by ChatGPT) doesn't? And does that matter to the average user? I'd argue it doesn't. I'd also argue that those willing to pay for a "Plus" subscription are more likely to use the platform way, way more than free users, which in turn may (as one Redditor hypothesized regarding Anthropic's "Claude Pro" subscription) lose it the revenue on said premium subscriber. While there's a chance that OpenAI could have a chunk of users that aren't particularly active, one cannot run a business based on selling stuff you hope that people won't use. I’ll touch on customer churn later, but one more note about ChatGPT Plus users: as with any other consumer-centric subscription product, these customers are far more likely to cut their spending when they no longer feel like they’re getting value from their product, or when their household budgets demand it. Netflix — the biggest name in streaming — lost a million customers in 2022, around the time of the cost-of-living crisis (and, from 2025, it plans to stop reporting subscriber numbers altogether) ChatGPT Plus is likely, for many people, a “lifestyle product.” And the problem is that, when people lose their jobs or inflation hikes, these products are the first to get slashed from the household budget. OpenAI also has a unique problem that makes it entirely different to most SaaS solutions — the cost of delivering the solution. While 3% conversion of free customers to paying customers might regularly be on the low side of "good," said solutions are nowhere near as expensive as running software using generative AI. There's also another wrinkle. If the majority of OpenAI's revenue — over 70% — comes from people paying for ChatGPT Plus, then that heavily suggests the majority of its compute costs come from what is arguably its least-profitable product. The only alternative is that OpenAI's compute costs are so high that, despite making two-thirds of its revenue, ChatGPT creates so much overhead that it sours the rest of the business. You see, ChatGPT Plus is not a great business. It's remarkable that OpenAI found 10 million people to pay for it, but how do you grow that to 20 million, or 40 million? These aren't idle questions, either. At present, OpenAI makes $225 million a month — $2.7 billion a year — by selling premium subscriptions to ChatGPT. To hit a revenue target of $11.6 billion in 2025, OpenAI would need to increase revenue from ChatGPT customers by 310%. If we consider the current ratio of Plus subscriptions to Teams and Enterprise subscriptions — about 88.89% to 11.11% — OpenAI would need to find 18.29 million paying users (assuming a price increase of $2 a month), while also retaining every single one of its current ChatGPT Plus users at a new price point, for a total $7.4 billion, or $616 million or so a month. It would also have to make $933 million in revenue from its business or enterprise clients, which, again, would require OpenAI to more-than-triple their current users. OpenAI's primary revenue source is one of the most easily-commoditized things in the world — a Large Language Model in a web browser — and its competitor is Mark Zuckerberg, a petty king with a huge warchest that can never, ever be fired, even with significant investor pressure. Even if that wasn't the case, the premium product that OpenAI sells is far from endearing, still looking for a killer app a year-and-a-half into its existence, with its biggest competitor being the free version of ChatGPT. There are ways that OpenAI could potentially turn this around, but even a battalion of experienced salespeople will still need paying, and will have the immediate job of "increase revenue by 300%" for a product that most people have trouble explaining. No, really. What is ChatGPT? Can you give me an answer that actually explains what the product does? What is the compelling use case that makes this a must-have? I am hammering this point because this is the majority of OpenAI's revenue. OpenAI lives and dies on the revenue gained from ChatGPT, a product that hasn't meaningfully changed since it launched beyond adding new models that do, for most users, exactly the same thing. While some might find ChatGPT's voice mode interesting, "interesting" just isn't good enough today. And to drill down further, the majority of OpenAI's revenue is from ChatGPT Plus, not its Enterprise or Teams product, meaning that hiring a sales team is far from practical. How do you sell this to consumers, or professionals? Even Microsoft, which has a vast marketing apparatus and deep pockets, struggled to sell Copilot — which is based on OpenAI’s GPT models — on its weird (and presumably expensive) Superbowl ads, or on the countless commercials that dotted the 2024 Olympic Games. To triple users, ChatGPT must meaningfully change, and do so immediately, or disclose multiple meaningful, powerful use cases that are so impressive that 18 million new people agree to pay $22 a month. That is an incredible — and some might say insane — goal, and one that I do not think this company is capable of achieving. Yet this is far from the most worrying part of the current OpenAI story. What's astounded me about this whole story is how little of OpenAI's revenue comes from providing other companies the means to integrate generative AI into their systems, for two big reasons: In the event that OpenAI and Microsoft are each making about a billion dollars in annualized revenue — again, these are estimates based on current growth trajectories — it heavily suggests that there is...two billion dollars of revenue? For Microsoft and OpenAI combined? That's god damn pathetic! That's really, really bad! And the fact these "annualized" figures have changed so little since June means that growth has slowed, because otherwise said numbers would have increased (as "annualized" is based on projections). Let me explain my reasoning a bit. “Annualized” revenue is a somewhat-vague term that can mean many things, but taking The Information’s definition from mid-June (when annualized revenue was $3.4 billion), annualized revenue is “a measure of the past month’s revenue multiplied by 12.” That suggests that OpenAI’s revenue in that month was $283 million, a number which the New York Times updated in their piece, saying that OpenAI made $300 million of revenue in the month of August, which works out to $3.6 billion in annualized revenue, and OpenAI expects to hit $3.7 billion this year, which works out to $308 million. Just so we’re abundantly clear — this means that OpenAI, unquestionably the leader and most-prominent brand and the first thought anybody will have when integrating generative AI, is only making about $80 million a month selling access to its models? This heavily-suggests that generative AI, as a technology, doesn’t necessarily have a product-market fit. According to a survey by Andreessen Horowitz earlier in the year, “the 2023 market share of closed-source models [was estimated at] 80 to 90%, with the majority of share going to OpenAI.” Another survey from IOT Analytics published late last year suggests that number might look a little bit different, with 39% of the market share going to OpenAI and 30% going to Microsoft. Assuming that the latter numbers are true, this suggests that the generative AI market is incredibly small. If OpenAI — which dominates with, I’d wager, at least a 30% market share — is only making $1 billion a year from selling access to its models, and at this stage in the massively-inflated hype bubble, there may not even be $10 billion of annual revenue from companies integrating generative AI into their products. And let’s be honest, this is where all of the money should be. If this stuff is the future of everything, why is the revenue stream so painfully weak? Why isn’t generative AI in everything — not just big apps and services hoping to ride a wave as it crests, oblivious to the imminent collapse — but all apps, and present in a big way, where it’s core to the app’s functionality? OpenAI making so little selling access to their models suggests that, despite the hype-cycle, there either isn’t the interest in integrating these products from developers, or these integrations aren’t that useful, attractive or impressive to users. Again, these products are charged on usage — and so, it’s possible for generative AI to be integrated into a service, but not actually drive much revenue for OpenAI. While ChatGPT has brand recognition, companies integrating OpenAI’s models in their products are far more indicative of the long-term health of both the company and the industry itself, because if OpenAI can’t convince people to integrate and use this shit, do you really think other companies are succeeding? There are two counterarguments: While I can’t say for certain, and I’ll happily admit if I’m wrong in the future, the numbers here suggest that OpenAI’s cloud services business — as in integrating its supposedly industry-leading technology into other products — is nowhere near as viable a business as selling subscriptions to ChatGPT, which in turn suggests that there is either a lack of interest in integrating generative AI, a lack of adoption once said integration has happened, or a lack of usage by users of features powered by generative AI itself. The only other avenue is that OpenAI isn’t charging what it believes these services are worth. As discussed earlier in the piece, OpenAI needs to more-than-triple revenue in the next 15 months to hit $11.6 billion in sales. Furthermore, at its current burn rate, OpenAI is currently spending $2.35 to make $1 — meaning that $11.6 billion in revenue will cost $27 billion to make. While costs could foreseeably come down, all signs point to them increasing. As noted above, GPT-4 cost $100 million to train, and more complex future models will cost hundreds of millions or even a billion dollars to train. The Information also estimated back in July that OpenAI's training costs would balloon to $3 billion in 2024, and it’s fair to assume that models like o1 and GPT-5 (also known as “Orion”) will be significantly more expensive to train. OpenAI also has a popularity problem. While it’s usually great news that a product has 300 million free users, every single time somebody uses the service costs OpenAI money, and lots of it. The Information estimated OpenAI will spend around $4 billion on server costs in 2024 to run ChatGPT and host other companies running services using GPT and its other models, effectively meaning that every dollar of revenue is immediately eaten by the costs of acquiring it. And that’s before you factor in paying the more-than 1,500 people that work at the company (another $1.5 billion in costs alone, and OpenAI expects to hire another 200 by the end of the year), and other costs like real estate and taxes. As a result, I am now updating my hypothesis. I believe that OpenAI, once it has raised its current ($6.5 billion to $7 billion) round, will have to raise another round of at least the same size by July 2025, if not sooner. To quote the New York Times’ reporting, “fund-raising material also signaled that OpenAI would need to continue raising money over the next year because its expenses grew in tandem with the number of people using its products.” OpenAI could potentially reduce costs, but has shown little proof that it’s able to, and its one attempt (the more efficient “Arrakis” model) failed to launch. One would also imagine that this company — now burning $5 billion a year — is doing all it can to try and bring costs down, and even if it isn’t, I severely doubt that it’s possible to. After all, Anthropic is facing exactly the same problem, and is on course to lose $2.7 billion in 2024 on $800 million in revenue, which makes me think the likelihood of this being a quick fix is extremely low. There is, however, another problem, one caused by their current fundraise. OpenAI is, at present, raising $6.5 to $7 billion in capital at a $150 billion valuation. Assuming it completes this raise — which is likely to happen — it will mean that all future rounds have to be at either $150 billion or higher. A lower valuation (called a down-round) would both upset current investors and send a loud signal to the market that the company is having trouble, which overwhelmingly suggests that OpenAI’s only way to survive is to raise its next round at a valuation of $200 billion, and require yet another giant raise, likely of at least $10 billion. For context, the biggest IPO valuation in US corporate history was Alibaba, which debuted onto the New York Stock Exchange with a market cap of nearly $170bn. That figure is more than double the runner-up, Facebook, which had a value of $81bn. Are you telling me that OpenAI — a company that burns vast piles of money like the Joker in The Dark Knight, and has no obvious path to profitability, and a dubious addressable market — is worth more than Alibaba, which, even a decade ago, was a giant of a company? Further souring the terms are its prior commitments to Microsoft, which owns 75% of all future profits (ha!) until it recoups its $13 billion investment, after which point it receives 49% of all profits until it is paid $1.56 trillion dollars, or 120 times the original amount, though the move to a non-profit structure may remove the limits on OpenAI’s ridiculous “profit participation units” where previous investors are given a slice of (theoretical) profits from the least profitable company in the world. Nevertheless, Microsoft’s iron grip on the future profits of this company — as well as complete access to its research and technology — means that anyone investing is effectively agreeing to help Microsoft out, and makes any stock (or PPUs) that Microsoft owns far more valuable. There’s also the other problem: how OpenAI converts its bizarre non-profit structure into a for-profit, and whether that’s actually possible. Investors are, according to the New York Times, hedging their bets. OpenAI has two years from the deal’s close to convert to a for-profit company, or its funding will convert into debt at a 9% interest rate. As a result, OpenAI now faces multiple challenges: Also, at some point, OpenAI will have to work out a way to go public, because otherwise there is absolutely no reason to invest in this company, unless you are doing so with the belief that you will be able to offload your shares in a future secondary sale. At that point, OpenAI resembles a kind of investment scam where new investors exist only to help old investors liquidate their assets rather than anyone investing in the actual value of the company itself. And, after that, OpenAI will still need to raise more rounds of funding. ChatGPT’s free version is a poison in its system, a marketing channel that burns billions of dollars to introduce people to a product that only ten million people will actually pay for, and its future depends largely on its ability to continue convincing people to use it. And in a few months, OpenAI’s integration with Apple devices launches, meaning that millions of people will now start using ChatGPT for free on their iPhones, with OpenAI footing the bill in the hopes they’ll upgrade to ChatGPT Plus, at which point Apple will take $6 of the $20 a month subscription. How does this continue? How does OpenAI survive? I realize I’ve been a little repetitive in this piece, but it’s really important to focus on the fact that the leader in the generative AI space does not appear to make that much money (less than 30% of its revenue) helping people put generative AI in their products, and makes most of their money selling subscriptions to a product that mostly coasts on hype. While it may seem impressive that OpenAI has 10 million paying subscribers, that’s the result of literally every AI story mentioning its name in almost every media outlet, and its name being on the lips of basically everybody in the entirety of the tech industry — and a chunk of the business world at large. Worse still, arguably the most important product that OpenAI sells is access to its models, and it’s the least-viable part of its business, despite “GPT” being synonymous with the concept of integrating generative AI into your company. Because access to its APIs isn’t a particularly big business, OpenAI’s hopes of hitting its revenue goals is almost entirely contingent on ChatGPT Plus continuing to grow. While this might happen in the short term (though research suggests that 11% of customers stop paying after a month and 26% after three months), ChatGPT Plus has no real moat, little product differentiation (outside of its advanced voice mode, which Meta is already working on a competitor to), and increasing commoditization from other models, open source platforms, and even on-device models (like on Copilot+-powered PCs). The features that ChatGPT is best known for — generating code, summarizing meetings, brainstorming and generating stuff — can be done on any number of other platforms, in many cases for free, and OpenAI’s biggest competitor to ChatGPT Plus is ChatGPT itself. And I cannot express enough how bad a sign it is that its cloud business is so thin. The largest player in the supposedly most important industry ever can only scrounge together $1 billion in annual revenue selling access to the most well-known model in the industry. This suggests a fundamental weakness in the revenue model behind GPT, as well as a fundamental weakness in the generative artificial intelligence market writ large. If OpenAI cannot make more than a billion dollars of revenue off of this, then it’s fair to assume that there is either a lack of interest from developers or a lack of interest from the consumers those developers are serving. Remember when I said that OpenAI mentioned in its recent Devay that it had “cut costs for developers to access [their] API by 99% in the last two years” (which Max Zeff of TechCrunch posits may be due to price pressure from Google and Meta)? That suggests that OpenAI really has no room to start charging more for access to its APIs. This technology is commoditized, with few points of differentiation. It can’t, for example, raise prices for the sake of a better, more capable product. OpenAI is trapped. All of this is happening at a time when an astronomical amount of talent is leaving the company — the talent that OpenAI desperately needs to build products that people will actually pay for. At this point, it’s hard to see how OpenAI survives. To continue growing ChatGPT Plus, it will have to create meaningful, mass-market use cases, or hope it can coast on a relatively-specious hype wave, one that will have to be so powerful it effectively triples its users. Even then, OpenAI will have to both find ways to give developers more reasons to integrate its models while making sure that said models provide a service that the end-user will actually appreciate, which is heavily-reliant on both the underlying technology and the ability of developers to create meaningful products with it. And OpenAI is getting desperate. According to Fortune, OpenAI’s culture is deeply brittle, with a “relentless pressure to introduce products” rushing its o1 model to market as Sam Altman was “eager to prove to potential investors in the company’s latest funding round that OpenAI remains at the forefront of AI development” despite staff saying it wasn’t ready. These aren’t the actions of a company that’s on the forefront of anything — they’re desperate moves made by desperate people burning the candle at both ends. Yet, once you get past these problems, you run head-first into the largest one: that generative AI is deeply unprofitable to run. When every subscriber or API call loses you money, growth only exists to help flog your company to investors, and at some point investors will begin to question whether this company can stand on its own two feet. It can’t. OpenAI is a disaster in the making, and behind it sits a potentially bigger, nastier disaster — a lack of any real strength in the generative AI market. If OpenAI can only make a billion dollars as the leader in this market (with $200 million of that coming from Microsoft reselling its models), it heavily suggests that there is neither developer nor user interest in generative AI products. Perhaps it’s the hallucination problem, or perhaps it’s just that generative AI isn’t something that produces particularly-interesting interactions with a user. While you could argue that “somebody can work out a really cool product,” it’s time to ask why Amazon, Google, Meta, OpenAI, Apple, and Microsoft have failed to make one in the last two years. Though ChatGPT Plus is popular, it’s clear that it operates — much like ChatGPT — as a way of seeing what generative AI can do rather than a product that customers love. I see no viable way for OpenAI to grow this product at the rate it needs to be grown, and that’s before considering its total lack of profit. I hypothesize that OpenAI will successfully close its $150 billion round in the next few weeks, but that growth is already slowing, and will slow dramatically as we enter the new year. I believe the upcoming earnings from Microsoft and Google will further dampen excitement around generative AI, which in turn will reduce the likelihood that developers will integrate GPT further into their products, while also likely depressing market interest in ChatGPT writ large. While this bubble can continue coasting for a while, nothing about the OpenAI story looks good. This is a company lost, bleeding money with every interaction with the customer, flogging software that’s at best kind-of useful and at worst actively harmful. Unless something significantly changes — like a breakthrough in energy or compute efficiency — I can’t see how this company makes it another two years. Worse still, If my hypothesis about the wider generative AI market is true, then there might simply not be a viable business in providing these services. While Meta and OpenAI might be able to claim hundreds of millions of people use these services, I see no evidence that these are products that millions of people will pay for long-term. For me to be wrong, these companies will have to solve multiple intractable problems, come up with entirely-new use cases, and raise historic amounts of capital. If I’m right, we’re watching venture capitalists and companies like Microsoft burn tens of billions of dollars to power the next generation of products that nobody gives a shit about.

ERIC KIM Just buy Bitcoin and/or Microstrategy stock (MSTR) First, it seems that making money is best and easiest and also most straightforward, and also has much more upside potential if you’re investing, trading, etc. So what is super interesting is if you want to create real wealth, and make a shitload of money, the market… getting an initial public offering, to be on the public traded market and stock market is your best bet. For example, all the wealthiest people on the planet, it is all universally through their stock options: For example Elon Musk has a net worth of $270 billion, as he holds approximately 13% of Tesla, and his shares are worth at around $821, making his Tesla holdings around $187 billion. Jeff Bezos is $204 billion, as he owns about 10% of Amazon. Assuming that Amazon is trading at around $130 per year, his Amazon share are worth approximately $130 billion. Also a shock I haven’t researched this in a long time, Apple is currently worth $3.43 trillion, and Nvidia at a surprising 3.13 trillion! Even super lame Microsoft, 3.04 trillion! Essentially the reason why this is Social shocking to me is that even in my lifetime as a kid until now… To become a millionaire was supposed to be the dream a big deal, now it is centi billionaire — example, Elon Musk has $270 billion! Blows my mind! The reason why bitcoin is by far the most Apex potential upside on the planet ,,, cause assuming that bitcoin is the first true money, the first true digital money, money perfected, and also because it is the biggest technology innovation of our time, then if that is the case, it should become the most valuable thing for the human race of all time. Once JP Morgan Chase starts to custody bitcoin, the price will explode! JPMorgan Chase has recently shared a positive outlook on Bitcoin’s performance for October 2024, referring to a seasonal trend often called “Uptober,” where Bitcoin typically sees a strong month of gains. JPMorgan analysts have highlighted that more than 70% of Octobers have historically resulted in positive returns for Bitcoin. This trend, coupled with recent macroeconomic shifts, including anticipated impacts from the Federal Reserve’s rate cuts, is expected to fuel Bitcoin’s momentum through Q4 . Additionally, JPMorgan is now invested in several spot Bitcoin ETFs, including those managed by major asset managers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale. The bank’s exposure to these ETFs represents a shift in its approach to cryptocurrencies, aiming to increase its involvement in the sector through diversified investment vehicles. This move could be seen as an effort to cater to growing client interest in digital assets . These developments signal JPMorgan’s strategic positioning in the cryptocurrency market as it anticipates further growth and institutional adoption of Bitcoin, influenced by both seasonal trends and expanded investment options. As of October 2024, Bitcoin’s market capitalization stands at approximately $1.248 trillion. This valuation reflects its position as the leading cryptocurrency by market cap, driven by its price, which hovers around $62,000 per BTC.

US stocks rebounded on Tuesday after Monday's losses, with momentum revived by a tech rally and falling crude prices. The Magnificent 7 tech cohort led the market higher, with Nvidia at the forefront. The AI chipmaker climbed 4% on Tuesday, while Meta, Tesla, and Microsoft all traded more than 1% higher. The surge in oil prices that pressured stocks on Monday, meanwhile, retraced, with international and US crude prices falling more than 4%. Energy traders pulled back on Monday as they continued to await retaliation from Israel over Iran's missile barrage last week, while a disappointing stimulus update in China weighed on the outlook for oil demand. In the US, Wall Street is keeping an eye on the upcoming consumer price index report for September. The inflation data will publish on Thursday, and will inform investors what to expect from the Federal Reserve's next policy meeting in November. Though the market had been anticipating another half-point interest rate cut next month, last Friday's big jobs report erased those forecasts. Bank of America expects any upside surprise in the inflation data may keep rates higher for longer. At the same time, Fed officials have cited optimistic expectations for rate cuts to continue. On Monday, New York Fed president John Williams told the Financial Times that a quarter-point cut is a "very good base case." Economists project consumer inflation for September to come in at 2.3% year-over-year, down from 2.5% in August. Tuesday's session also marked the start of earnings season. In a new report, BofA noted that the bar for third-quarter earnings is low, adding that investors will likely reward firms as long as they express confidence about lower rates. Major US financial firms, including JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and BlackRock, report results on Friday. Among Tuesday's notable movers was Roblox, which briefly fell nearly 10% in intraday trading, after short-seller Hindenburg Research took aim at the gaming platform. Meanwhile, China's sharp equity rally showed signs of slowing down. Beijing's failure to announce new stimulus plans on Tuesday has disappointed investors.

Title: Inside Economics: Ready for OCR cuts, today’s the day... plus, could petrol prices and AI bubbles ruin the economic recovery?

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. OPINION Welcome to Inside Economics. Every week, I take a deeper dive into some of the more left-field economic news you may have missed. To sign up to my weekly newsletter, click here. If you have a burning question about the quirks or intricacies of economics send it to liam.dann@nzherald.co.nz or leave a message in the comments section. Today we get one of the most highly anticipated Official Cash Rate calls in years. At 2pm the RBNZ will release its October Monetary Policy Review (MPR) and there’ll be no shortage of homeowners and business people hoping for significant relief. The MPR is different to the full Monetary Policy Statement we got in August. It means we’ll just get a one-page release with no press conference and no fresh forecasts. But you can still bet that every word of the release will be pored over for clues to the outlook. A 25 basis point rate cut is almost certainly baked in. But will Governor Adrian Orr and the monetary policy committee double down and deliver 50 basis points? The local bank economists have all picked that he will, but they’ve all added that it is a close call. So it’s far from a done deal. In the end, it will come down to an RBNZ judgment on just how grim the economy really is right now. Some commentators - like Greg Smith from Devon Funds Management - have even suggested that a 75 basis point cut might be warranted. That seems unlikely, as it would send panic signals to the market. The RBNZ gets another shot in November with a full Monetary Policy Statement and if it cuts by 50 bps then as well, that would send us into the new year with an OCR at 4.25%. Economists are picking the rate will fall further next year, so there is more relief on the way. ASB expects the OCR will be down to 4% by February 2025 and will reach a terminal rate of 3.25% from around mid-2025. KiwiBank economists say market traders are putting “odds-on” bets of 50 bps cuts all the way through until February. “The cash rate is priced to hit 3% by August next year, with a terminal rate around 2.5%, in line with our forecast,” they said. So there is no question relief is on its way ... it’s just a question of how fast. Check-in on the nzherald.co.nz site at 2pm for the decision and analysis. That’s my favourite question about the economy. It’s more of a prelude to a range of questions, but it draws on the seemingly endless well of pessimism that economics inspires. If things are going well, we can worry that the only way from here is down. If things are going badly, we can worry about our capacity to cope with any more bad news. Remarkably, things are going pretty well for the global economy right now. There is a chance that this optimism will flow through to New Zealand as interest rates start to fall. As discussed last week, the US economy is on a roll - its annual economic growth rate has recovered to 3% and at the weekend we saw its latest job creation data (the quirkily named non-farm payrolls) showed a big surprise on the upside. It looks like the US will avoid recession, giving the US Federal Reserve breathing space to cut rates in a measured fashion. This comes alongside a struggling Chinese economy that has already boosted iron ore prices, which will give Australia’s economy a shot in the arm. Hopefully, the stimulus will lift Chinese consumer sentiment too, which could boost prices for dairy and our other food exports like meat, wine and fruit. We might even see a much-needed lift in the number of Chinese tourists to New Zealand. So what, if anything, could derail this positive economic outlook? Since the conflict in the Middle East broadened to include Lebanon and Iran, oil prices have spiked about 10%. That’s a concern for those still worried about the tail end of inflation - not to mention being a pain for drivers who were just starting to enjoy the benefits of lower prices at the pump. Brent crude - the variety of oil that New Zealand petrol prices are pinned to - spiked above US$81 ($131) on Tuesday after the latest strikes by Israel and Hezbollah. It’s safe to say you’ll be paying more to fill up the tank this weekend. But it’s worth keeping the spike in context. It takes us back to where we were in August and we’re still a long way off this year’s high of US$90.38. Obviously, a wider war between Israel and Iran would be a disaster for the world. We’ve seen Iran launch a large-scale but ineffective missile attack against Israel and now the world is waiting on Israel’s response. The stakes are high and it’s an awful situation for the region. It would be foolish to try to pick how it all plays out. But essentially there is a binary way of looking at the economic risk. Either we’ll see an expansion of Israel’s conflict with Iran or we won’t. If Israel can be convinced (and there will be a lot of US lobbying going on) to respond in a measured way, perhaps this part of the current conflict will settle down. If that’s the case, we could see oil prices slide back as the rest of the conflict - as terrible as it all is - has less direct impact on oil supply. Iran is the world’s seventh-largest oil exporter, though half of its exports go to China. If a serious and sustained conflict breaks out between Iran and Israel, there is a risk oil prices could spike back above US$100. They rose to $US130 a barrel after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. These are different times though. Broadly, oil prices have been coming down over the past year, mostly due to subdued demand, with both the US and Chinese economies being sluggish. As these economies rebound we should expect oil prices to rise, regardless of the Middle East situation. The big variable in all of this is OPEC+, which still controls 40% of global supply. That’s enough that it can shift the price significantly depending on how much oil it decides to produce. Saudi Arabia is the largest producer in OPEC+ and that gives it significant political sway. It’s one of the reasons the US maintains such friendly relations with the Saudis. So far it has played a neutral hand, neither boosting nor cutting production. Good news for human readers: if MIT economist Daron Acemoglu is to be believed, AI is unlikely to be able to replace more than 5% of jobs in the next decade. There, bad news for humans with KiwiSaver accounts, though, as Acemoglu is a leading voice among a growing camp of sceptics who believe AI hype has created a bubble that will likely cause a stock market crash. AI stocks - like chip maker Nvidia - have been very good to KiwiSaver funds over the past few years. Nvidia shares were worth US$12 in October 2022. Today they are worth US$125. Acemoglu, who says he is not anti-AI or even pessimistic about its long-term prospects, hit the headlines last week with his big call about the low level of jobs that AI can actually do. The Herald picked up the coverage from the Washington Post (read the full article here). It’s probably worth mentioning that 5% of jobs is still a lot of jobs. That would effectively double our unemployment rate to 10% if it happened overnight. But as promising as AI is for many things, there’s little chance it will live up to that hype, Acemolu says. “A lot of money is going to get wasted,” he says. “You’re not going to get an economic revolution out of that 5%.” He notes that four companies alone - Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta Platforms - invested more than US$50 billion into capital spending in the second quarter of this year, with much of that going towards AI. Having lived through the dotcom crash in 2000, I’ve been bothered by the risks of an AI bubble for some time (even as I’ve watched it pump my KiwiSaver account). I remain ever hopeful that we might see pricing levels rebalance in an orderly fashion as investors switch out of tech stocks and into more mainstream companies that will benefit as interest rates fall. But that’s seldom how market bubbles resolve themselves. Usually, things are much more dramatic. Acemoglu sees three scenarios - a best case, a bad case and a worst case. The best we can hopeful is the kind of gradual deflation and rebalancing of valuations, he says. There have been promising signs of this in the past few months. The tech-heavy Nasdaq stock exchange, home to Nvidia, has risen just 1.2% in the past six months. In fact, it is down about 4% since its most recent peak - just before August’s “flash crash” market sell-off. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 - full of more traditional companies - has hit a series of record highs in the past couple of weeks. But the Nasdaq is still up 40% in the past year and 130% since 2019. If investors get spooked, there is still enough air in there to deflate rapidly. In Acemoglu’s second scenario, the AI hype keeps rolling for another year or so, leading to a tech stock crash that burns off corporate enthusiasm for the technology. “AI spring followed by AI winter,” he says. But there’s a third, even worse scenario. As the Washington Post puts it: “The mania goes unchecked for years, leading companies to cut scores of jobs and pump hundreds of billions of dollars into AI without understanding what they’re going to do with it, only to be left scrambling to try to rehire workers when the technology doesn’t pan out.” That could have widespread fallout for the entire global economy, Acemoglu says. Ominously, he sees a combination of the second and third scenarios as most likely. But not this year at least! US political mayhem might be a more pressing risk. As mentioned above, America’s economy has been humming along nicely. Could the upcoming election derail that? There is plenty of commentary highlighting the risks with both presidential candidates. On balance, there is probably more concern about Donald Trump and his plans for 10% tariffs on all imports, although it depends on who you ask. Elon Musk seems more concerned about Kamala Harris’ tax plans and ambitions to rein in the tech sector with price controls and other regulations. If we strip out the partisan political takes, the one big risk that remains is around an uncertain or contested election result. If we don’t get a clear result on the night, we will face weeks of recounts or even months of uncertainty if things end up going through the courts. That seems likely given how close the polling is and how high the stakes are. Markets famously hate uncertainty. Wall Street is likely to cope with either a Trump or Harris presidency. But a power vacuum for any significant length of time might be enough to spook investors and derail the current rally. This year’s Mood of the Boardroom survey of chief executives and directors showed a surge of optimism about the economic outlook from here. But one thing they weren’t so upbeat about was New Zealand’s recent economic performance. As I wrote for Inside Economics back in August, the idea of a “hard” or “soft” landing refers to whether policymakers can bring down inflation by lifting interest rates without putting the economy into recession. On that definition, New Zealand has had a hard landing. If the Reserve Bank forecasts are correct, we are currently in our third recession in two years. But interestingly, when business leaders were asked what they thought, the results weren’t a slam dunk. Some 65% gave a hard “no” to the suggestion we might have managed a soft landing. Around 20% were unsure and 15% said yes. Mitigating factors might include that the recessions so far have been shallow (albeit propped up by high net migration). Unemployment is still below 5%, a historically low level. And despite some grim headlines and high-profile business failures, the stats for credit arrears, mortgagee sales and business liquidations remain lower than they were during the GFC and the years immediately after it. There’s no question it’s a tough economy right now. But the long-term damage the period does will ultimately depend on how many jobs are lost and how many businesses fail. Here’s hoping the recovery rolls on smoothly from here and we escape with something that might still be described as “softish”. Liam Dann is business editor-at-large for the New Zealand Herald.

Every week, I take a deeper dive into some of the more left-field economic news you may have missed. To sign up to my weekly newsletter, click here. If you have a burning question about the quirks or intricacies of economics send it to liam.dann@nzherald.co.nz or leave a message in the comments section. Today we get one of the most highly anticipated Official Cash Rate calls in years. At 2pm the RBNZ will release its October Monetary Policy Review (MPR) and there’ll be no shortage of homeowners and business people hoping for significant relief. The MPR is different to the full Monetary Policy Statement we got in August. It means we’ll just get a one-page release with no press conference and no fresh forecasts. But you can still bet that every word of the release will be pored over for clues to the outlook. A 25 basis point rate cut is almost certainly baked in. But will Governor Adrian Orr and the monetary policy committee double down and deliver 50 basis points? The local bank economists have all picked that he will, but they’ve all added that it is a close call. So it’s far from a done deal. In the end, it will come down to an RBNZ judgment on just how grim the economy really is right now. Some commentators - like Greg Smith from Devon Funds Management - have even suggested that a 75 basis point cut might be warranted. That seems unlikely, as it would send panic signals to the market. The RBNZ gets another shot in November with a full Monetary Policy Statement and if it cuts by 50 bps then as well, that would send us into the new year with an OCR at 4.25%. Economists are picking the rate will fall further next year, so there is more relief on the way. ASB expects the OCR will be down to 4% by February 2025 and will reach a terminal rate of 3.25% from around mid-2025. KiwiBank economists say market traders are putting “odds-on” bets of 50 bps cuts all the way through until February. “The cash rate is priced to hit 3% by August next year, with a terminal rate around 2.5%, in line with our forecast,” they said. So there is no question relief is on its way ... it’s just a question of how fast. Check-in on the nzherald.co.nz site at 2pm for the decision and analysis. That’s my favourite question about the economy. It’s more of a prelude to a range of questions, but it draws on the seemingly endless well of pessimism that economics inspires. If things are going well, we can worry that the only way from here is down. If things are going badly, we can worry about our capacity to cope with any more bad news. Remarkably, things are going pretty well for the global economy right now. There is a chance that this optimism will flow through to New Zealand as interest rates start to fall. As discussed last week, the US economy is on a roll - its annual economic growth rate has recovered to 3% and at the weekend we saw its latest job creation data (the quirkily named non-farm payrolls) showed a big surprise on the upside. It looks like the US will avoid recession, giving the US Federal Reserve breathing space to cut rates in a measured fashion. This comes alongside a struggling Chinese economy that has already boosted iron ore prices, which will give Australia’s economy a shot in the arm. Hopefully, the stimulus will lift Chinese consumer sentiment too, which could boost prices for dairy and our other food exports like meat, wine and fruit. We might even see a much-needed lift in the number of Chinese tourists to New Zealand. So what, if anything, could derail this positive economic outlook? Since the conflict in the Middle East broadened to include Lebanon and Iran, oil prices have spiked about 10%. That’s a concern for those still worried about the tail end of inflation - not to mention being a pain for drivers who were just starting to enjoy the benefits of lower prices at the pump. Brent crude - the variety of oil that New Zealand petrol prices are pinned to - spiked above US$81 ($131) on Tuesday after the latest strikes by Israel and Hezbollah. It’s safe to say you’ll be paying more to fill up the tank this weekend. But it’s worth keeping the spike in context. It takes us back to where we were in August and we’re still a long way off this year’s high of US$90.38. Obviously, a wider war between Israel and Iran would be a disaster for the world. We’ve seen Iran launch a large-scale but ineffective missile attack against Israel and now the world is waiting on Israel’s response. The stakes are high and it’s an awful situation for the region. It would be foolish to try to pick how it all plays out. But essentially there is a binary way of looking at the economic risk. Either we’ll see an expansion of Israel’s conflict with Iran or we won’t. If Israel can be convinced (and there will be a lot of US lobbying going on) to respond in a measured way, perhaps this part of the current conflict will settle down. If that’s the case, we could see oil prices slide back as the rest of the conflict - as terrible as it all is - has less direct impact on oil supply. Iran is the world’s seventh-largest oil exporter, though half of its exports go to China. If a serious and sustained conflict breaks out between Iran and Israel, there is a risk oil prices could spike back above US$100. They rose to $US130 a barrel after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. These are different times though. Broadly, oil prices have been coming down over the past year, mostly due to subdued demand, with both the US and Chinese economies being sluggish. As these economies rebound we should expect oil prices to rise, regardless of the Middle East situation. The big variable in all of this is OPEC+, which still controls 40% of global supply. That’s enough that it can shift the price significantly depending on how much oil it decides to produce. Saudi Arabia is the largest producer in OPEC+ and that gives it significant political sway. It’s one of the reasons the US maintains such friendly relations with the Saudis. So far it has played a neutral hand, neither boosting nor cutting production. Good news for human readers: if MIT economist Daron Acemoglu is to be believed, AI is unlikely to be able to replace more than 5% of jobs in the next decade. There, bad news for humans with KiwiSaver accounts, though, as Acemoglu is a leading voice among a growing camp of sceptics who believe AI hype has created a bubble that will likely cause a stock market crash. AI stocks - like chip maker Nvidia - have been very good to KiwiSaver funds over the past few years. Nvidia shares were worth US$12 in October 2022. Today they are worth US$125. Acemoglu, who says he is not anti-AI or even pessimistic about its long-term prospects, hit the headlines last week with his big call about the low level of jobs that AI can actually do. The Herald picked up the coverage from the Washington Post (read the full article here). It’s probably worth mentioning that 5% of jobs is still a lot of jobs. That would effectively double our unemployment rate to 10% if it happened overnight. But as promising as AI is for many things, there’s little chance it will live up to that hype, Acemolu says. “A lot of money is going to get wasted,” he says. “You’re not going to get an economic revolution out of that 5%.” He notes that four companies alone - Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta Platforms - invested more than US$50 billion into capital spending in the second quarter of this year, with much of that going towards AI.

Title: Florida's real-estate market is on edge amid back-to-back hurricanes

Another hurricane is expected to hit Florida as the state continues recovering from Hurricane Helene. Hurricane Milton, a Category 4 storm (it weakened from a Category 5, but remains "extremely dangerous"), is on track to make landfall near Tampa Bay by Wednesday. It's the latest hurdle for the state's volatile real-estate market. Milton's peak wind speeds hit 160 mph on Monday. Heavy rain is expected before the storm arrives, and flooding is anticipated throughout the region. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has issued a state of emergency for 51 counties, and mandatory evacuations have begun in some areas. The mayor of Tampa, Jane Castor, has also issued a stark warning that anyone who remains in the city as Milton approaches will "die." It's never a good time for a hurricane to hit, but preparing for a powerful storm while you recover from another makes the situation even more challenging. Helene caused over 220 deaths and as much as $34 billion in damage, according to an estimate from Moody's Analytics. Meanwhile, federal agencies meant to provide emergency assistance, like FEMA and the Small Business Administration, face their own cash crises. Back-to-back hurricanes represent the latest problem for a real-estate market facing buyer's remorse. The threat and cost that hurricanes pose mean Florida homeowners have some reevaluating to do if they want to remain in the state, write Business Insider's Jordan Pandy, Dan Latu, and Madeline Berg. One homeowner told BI she pays $7,000 a year in flood and hazard insurance for her 1,400-square-foot bungalow just south of Tampa. (The policies paid off, her home was deemed uninhabitable after Helene, and she still wants to live there after it's repaired.) But those high costs, coupled with the annual fear of potentially losing your home every fall, have other residents throwing in the towel. Even a few insurers have called it quits on the state, while others could increase their prices by over 300% in the coming years. It's representative of the extremes the Sunshine State's real-estate market has faced in recent years. One of the pandemic's hottest markets, some people are now souring on Florida over its climate, costs, and overcrowding. (It's not alone in its post-pandemic comedown, as Texas is facing a similar fate.) But as much as people want to get out of the state, there will always be those looking to get in. More than 8,000 miles of coastline will do that. One Florida resident whose home sustained almost three feet of water damage from Helene cut their listing price by 40%. Within hours, their real-estate agent received 25 calls from investors interested in the property. Jump to

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Palantir Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) are among the artificial intelligence stocks that have seen strong gains since early to mid-September. While the former is perched at a record high, the latter, despite its recent strong run, is yet to reclaim its Jan. 2021 peak. Here’s a look at the relative performance of these two stocks and what the near-term holds for them: Meta Vs. Palantir: Meta has gained over 68% for the year-to-date period, while Palantir is up a steeper 133%. The data analytics company co-founded by Peter Thiel is the fourth best-performing S&P 500 company this year, while Meta, co-founded by Mark Zuckerberg, holds the 11th spot on the list.

Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. Interest rates are falling but you can still make high yields in real estate. Find out how. Both stocks have outperformed the broader market, as represented by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) – an exchange-traded fund that tracks the S&P 500 Index. Valuations of both stocks have become expensive following the recent spike. The forward price-earnings ratio for Palantir is currently at a hefty 95.2 but Meta is trading at a more modest forward P/E valuation of 24.75. The social media giant’s P/E ratio is fairly in line with 21.3 which is applicable to the communications services sector. The Palantir Rally: Palantir has been on an uptrend since it gap-opened higher on Sept. 9, the first session after the S&P Dow Jones Indices said the company would be added to the S&P 500 Index, effective prior to the start of trading on Sept. 23. Commenting on the feat, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said, “The profitability profile of this story has significantly been bolstered with this another validation moment for the Palantir story.” Although there was a ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ moment after the inclusion, the stock has been grinding solidly higher since the start of October. Meta Connects With Investors: After the early August broader market swoon set in motion by yen carry-trade unwinding, Meta’s stock found its feet shortly after and climbed higher until mid-August. The stock experienced a mild pullback that lasted through mid-September. The two-day Meta Connect conference held on Sept. 25-26 saw the company announcing a slew of products and other offerings. These include AI-driven chatbots, an updated Llama large-language model, the latest Ray-Ban smart glasses with improved camera functionality, voice controls, and deeper integration with AI, Meta Quest 4, the next-generation virtual reality headset, and the Orion augmented reality glasses. The stock has been on a steady climb since then. Trending: Your biggest returns may not come from the stock market. Invest the way colleges, pension funds, and the 1% do. Get started investing in commercial real estate today. Further Upside? The average analysts’ price targets, compiled by TipRanks, suggest modest upside potential for Meta but downside for Palantir. Current Price 1-Year Average Analysts’ Price Target Upside/Downside Potential Meta $595.94 $608.20 +2.06% Palantir $40.01 $27.67 (-30.84%) The next big catalyst for Meta is likely to be the company’s third-quarter results due on Oct. 30, with the consensus modeling over 30% earnings per share growth and nearly 20% revenue growth. Meta’s fortunes to a large extent is tied to ad spending, which in turn hinges on macroeconomic conditions. With the Fed showing a proclivity to take rates down in the coming months, credit conditions could ease, potentially benefiting Meta. Palantir is a favorite among retail investors. Continuing deal flow, and strong third-quarter results and positive fourth-quarter guidance could keep the upward momentum intact. More importantly, the market has entered a seasonally strong quarter when a confluence of factors typically lifts the market. The stretched valuations, therefore, may not preclude further gains. That said, investors may remain wary of geopolitical and macroeconomic headwinds, with two wars ongoing and a hard-landing scenario still not off the table.

Title: How Kamala Harris Is Creating a New Majoritarian Center
URL: https://newrepublic.com/article/186863/kamala-harris-economic-policy-new-majoritarian-center
Time Published: 2024-10-08T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Almost from the moment Joe Biden stepped aside in favor of Kamala Harris, the concern trolling commenced. “Harris’s biggest political liability is that she may be seen as too politically extreme,” fretted very serious journalist Josh Barro before advising the new Democratic nominee to “run to the center.” Former Bill Clinton adviser Douglas Schoen concurred, confidently telling CNBC that “the key for her campaign is moving to the center.” To satisfy New York magazine political columnist Jonathan Chait, a mere “pivot” to the center would not be enough. Rather, he provocatively suggested, “Harris needs to adopt positions that will upset progressive activists.” Apparently, Harris’s nomination didn’t just unite the Democratic base. It also united a parade of pundits, politicos, and conventional wisdom–mongers of all stripes in urging her to unceremoniously betray the base by swerving to the center—especially on the economy—if she’s to have a fighting chance of defeating Donald Trump at the polls. Given the divisive state of American politics, that might not sound like such an unreasonable take. But glaringly absent from this allegedly centrist consensus is a working definition of what or where the political and economic “center” actually is. And spoiler alert: On most issues, the center is arguably somewhere in the vicinity of Kamala Harris. Especially on the economy. To understand why, we need to think a little bit about what would comprise a truly “centrist economics.” But before we do that, we need to define our terms. The whole left-right dichotomy dates back to the early days of the French Revolution, when members of the National Assembly who favored a more revolutionary path (that is, a republic) took to sitting to the left, while those defending the ancien régime (the monarchists) gathered together on the right. Today, we universally put conservatives on the right and progressives on the left. Policies that favor the rich go on the right, policies that favor working people go on the left. An economic ideology that advocates unfettered free market capitalism definitely goes on the right, while a Marxist dictatorship of the proletariat is the sine qua non of far left. Most people still have a shared intuition about what the political labels “left” and “right” mean, particularly in regard to how competing policy proposals relate to one another. But the “center”? Not so much. For example, most people would instantly agree that a proposal to more than double the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour would fall on the left or even far-left side of the spectrum. After all, it’s more than double! Yet ask people to pick an ideologically “centrist” minimum wage rate and this remarkable consensus instantly falls apart. Self-described centrists often pride themselves on reaching across the aisle to negotiate bipartisan compromise. But ideological centrism can’t be as simple as just splitting the difference—in fact, on many noneconomic issues, difference-splitting would be facially absurd. For example, how do we split the difference on marriage equality, or on the peaceful transfer of power? How would we split the difference on Trump’s plan for the “bloody” deportation of 20 million people? Would a centrist alternative be just 10 million deportations, and with precisely half as much blood? And even on economic issues that can be easily quantified in dollars, difference-splitting can make little sense. Splitting the difference between $15 and $0—that’s the essence of the Project 2025 proposal, which would allow states to opt out of enforcing a minimum wage at all—would set the federal minimum wage at just 25 cents more than the current $7.25-an-hour rate that has been relentlessly eroded away by inflation for the 15 years that have passed since the last increase in the federal minimum wage. That’s not centrism. That’s defending the status quo, a quintessentially conservative instinct that has long been associated with the political right. The truth is, there is no inherently centrist ideology. According to an analysis by 538, the large plurality of voters who self-identify as moderate are in fact “all over the ideological map.” That’s why if you ask the average person to describe an ideologically centrist policy position, they usually default to the position they already hold. And in fact, that’s exactly what Barro and Schoen and Chait and others have done in assuming that Harris’s positions are “too politically extreme.” The center to them is where they currently stand—smack dab in the middle of the old neoliberal consensus that had long dominated both parties before Biden abandoned it in favor of an agenda that grows the economy “from the middle out.” And it’s that neoliberal center they want Harris to reclaim. Neoliberalism argues that markets are inherently efficient, rational, and meritocratic, and that the fastest path toward achieving the greatest good for the greatest number of people is to simply get out of the market’s way. Over the nearly half-century during which neoliberalism held sway, the ideologically centrist agenda was dominated by tax cuts for the rich, deregulation of the powerful, and wage suppression for everyone else. The result was decades of rising and radical inequality that have undermined faith in both democracy and markets. And if this sort of centrism is your measuring stick, then yes, the Harris agenda might look a little extreme. But there are in fact two kinds of political centers: There’s the ideological center—the one that neoliberals have long occupied. And there’s the majoritarian center—the one where most of the people are. Harris’s critics are half correct. If Democrats hope to be a majority party, they need to embrace the center. But it’s the majoritarian center, not the ideological one, that matters most in November. As I argued in Politico Magazine back in 2018, to understand the difference between these two strains of economic centrism, it’s important to understand exactly what the center is measuring. Imagine lining up every person in America on a yardstick, with the poorest person standing to the far-left edge of the stick (zero inches) and the wealthiest person standing to the far right (36 inches). Assuming that people are equally spaced, and that there is no correlation between wealth and weight—if you could balance that yardstick on the tip of your finger—the fulcrum would fall on the 18-inch mark, the exact center of the yardstick, with exactly half of all Americans standing to the left, and the other half standing to the right. Clustered on and near that 18-inch mark are the median American families—the middle-middle class: the majoritarian center of the American electorate, at least from an economic perspective. Now imagine that very same yardstick with every American standing in their very same spots—only this time, rather than balancing people, we are balancing their personal wealth, stacked up in $100 bills. But because 2 percent of Americans (of which I am one) own 50 percent of the nation’s wealth, to balance this yardstick you’d now have to slide your finger nearly all the way over, beyond the 35-inch mark, just inside the far-right edge. This fulcrum balances the interests of capital versus the interests of working people. And unfortunately, this is the yardstick that represents the reality of political and economic power distribution in the United States. It’s the yardstick of the neoliberal center—a centrism informed by the bad economic theories that guided the policies of both parties for more than 40 years. This precarious balancing act helps explain why policies that would clearly benefit the majoritarian center are so often rejected as ideologically “far left”; for an ideological centrism that seeks to balance the interests of capital is a centrism that seeks to protect the interests of the very wealthiest Americans against those of everybody else. By contrast, a majoritarian centrism focuses its policies more on outcomes than on ideology. For example, consider again the $15 minimum wage, a policy our intuition suggests leans ideologically to the left. At $7.25 an hour, the current federal minimum wage provides a floor under only 1.1 percent of all wage and salary workers—a cohort one might fairly characterize as occupying the far left of our economic yardstick. By comparison, a hike to $15 an hour would directly or indirectly benefit 29.2 percent of workers. And with half of all American jobs paying less than $23.11 an hour, a $20 minimum wage (almost exactly what the minimum wage would be today had it been raised to $15 and indexed to inflation back when that idea was first proposed in 2012) would directly cover a large plurality of workers, while indirectly pushing wages higher for many millions more as employers raise wages further up the pay scale in order to maintain differentiation relative to the minimum. From a majoritarian perspective—a perspective that asks, “Who benefits?”—the higher you raise the minimum wage, the more centrist the policy becomes! (For those neoliberals still insisting the minimum wage would hurt workers by destroying jobs, a recent meta-analysis of 88 minimum wage studies concluded that estimates published since 2010 found near zero offset from earnings due to lost jobs.) Further bolstering its centrist credentials, raising the minimum wage turns out to be extraordinarily popular across all partisan identifications. Eighty-five percent of likely voters would support a $9 minimum wage, 83 percent a $12 minimum wage, and 64 percent a $17 minimum wage. Even Republicans are largely on board. It’s hard to find another economic issue with greater majoritarian support. And the minimum wage is just one of many intuitively left- (and sometimes right-) leaning proposals that pass the following two-part majoritarian centrist test: 1. Is the policy broadly beneficial? A policy that directly benefits a majority of Americans clearly passes this part of the test, but so might a policy that benefits a large plurality, especially if the beneficiaries are clustered around the middle. 2. Is the policy broadly popular? Obviously, policies that enjoy majority support are clearly popular, and most of the elements of the Biden-Harris economic agenda pass this test. Even Harris’s pledge to go after price gouging, widely derided by economists, is popular. But in addition, given a deeply divided electorate, a policy should not necessarily require an absolute majority in order to pass this test. For example, a policy that receives just 40 percent support but with only 20 percent opposed may in fact be more majoritarian and certainly less divisive than a policy that enjoys a slim 50.1 percent majority support to 49.9 percent opposed. A policy that is both broadly beneficial and broadly popular is properly located within the majoritarian center. And by this measure, the bulk of Harris’s economic agenda is inarguably centrist regardless of how ideologically left or right we might at first intuit it to be. In fact, if you step through Harris’s 82-page economic plan and evaluate it from the left, right, and center (I’m looking at you, Josh Barro), I challenge you to conclude that any of her proposals are “politically extreme” either by ideological or majoritarian standards. Among Harris’s signature proposals is to cut taxes on more than 100 million working- and middle-class families through restoring and enhancing the Child Tax Credit, or CTC, and the Earned Income Tax Credit, or EITC, with the costs paid for by increasing the tax on stock buybacks, enacting a billionaire’s tax, and raising the capital gains tax rate for those earning more than a million dollars a year. All of these proposals score as both broadly popular and (unless you’re a recalcitrant trickle-downer) broadly beneficial, so they are majoritarian centrist to their core. But instructively, they also highlight how useless our ideological intuitions can sometimes be. The EITC, for example, has long been an essential thread in our social safety net, lifting millions of families out of poverty by supplementing low-wage pay. So it sure feels like it leans to the left. And yet … first proposed by Richard Nixon and signed into law by Gerald Ford, the EITC is essentially a variation on Milton Friedman’s negative income tax—about as economically right a pedigree as a policy could have. Furthermore, in practice, this tax credit is as much a subsidy to low-wage employers as it is to low-wage workers, helping to perpetuate an exploitive business model that increases profits at the expense of the working poor. And this isn’t the only Harris proposal that challenges standard categories. On housing, Harris proposes working with public, private, and not-for-profit developers to build an additional three million affordable housing units over the course of her first term, while “cut[ting] red tape” (i.e., deregulation) and imposing new regulations on corporate property owners who drive up prices by hoarding supply or by colluding on rents. In addition, she proposes to help first-time homebuyers with up to $25,000 toward a down payment. Because this ideologically nuanced fusion of regulation, deregulation, public investment, and market incentives would benefit millions, it clearly serves the interests of the majoritarian center. And while neoliberal critics might dismiss any role for government in directing the housing industry as too far left, there remains “strong bipartisan support for federal action” on housing affordability. The same is true of Harris’s pledge to “build” on the progress made through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, and the American Rescue Plan, as well as to continue the Biden administration’s practices in favor of organized labor and against unfair trade. This embrace of industrial policy—of (gasp) state planning—might reasonably be intuited as ideologically left. Yet many of the policies required to implement it (for example, hundreds of billions of dollars of grants and loans to giant corporations) arguably lean to the right. So which is it? Republican Senator Marco Rubio makes a compelling case that industrial policy, properly done, is inherently neither left nor right, and I totally agree. That said, the policy objectives are all broadly progressive, broadly popular, and if properly done, broadly beneficial. The rest of Harris’s agenda is easier on our ideological intuition. Her proposal to increase the startup expense tax deduction for new businesses from $5,000 to $50,000 arguably leans right, while nearly everything else is at least moderately progressive. But they are all majoritarian. Protecting Social Security and Medicare, providing quality affordable childcare, long term care, and education, tackling the climate crisis and lowering energy costs by investing in clean energy, lowering drug prices by taking on Big Pharma, and “expanding and strengthening the Affordable Care Act” (as opposed to Trump’s “concepts of a plan” to repeal and replace it)—they all pass the test. Quibble with the details of my analysis all you want, but there is arguably nothing in Harris’s economic plan that is ideologically “extreme,” and while taken as a whole her agenda is clearly progressive, it is also more fiscally conservative than what her opponent has proposed. Don’t take my word for it: The Penn Wharton Budget Model—a paragon of neoliberal orthodoxy—finds that Harris’s tax and spending proposals would increase primary deficits by $1.2 trillion over the next ten years. By comparison, the Trump proposals? $5.8 trillion! From a budget hawk perspective, it’s the Trump economic agenda that is extreme. Of course, the obvious question, the one that is always hurled at Democrats who propose good things, is “How are you going to pay for it?” And the answer is that policies that grow the middle class pay for themselves. Not in the first year, maybe not over 10 years, but certainly in the long run, because, as Harris recently explained in a speech to the Economic Club of Pittsburgh, the middle class is “the growth engine of our economy.” This is the “middle-out economics” that clearly infuses Harris’s economic agenda—an economics informed by decades of empirical research and the latest advances in the fields of complex systems theory, evolutionary theory, physics, behavioral psychology, and other disciplines. And while middle-out still has far to go before achieving the same ideological devotion as neoliberalism, it has already proven far more capable at connecting cause with effect. For example, the Democratic policy agenda has always been more middle-out than the Republicans’, even during the neoliberal era, which helps explain why, by every standard economic metric—including gross domestic product growth, job growth, wage growth, investment growth, the S&P 500, and yes, even inflation—on average, the economy has performed better under Democratic administrations than under Republicans. It’s doubtful that most Democratic elected officials understood that their more inclusive agenda was also more pro-growth, but if they did, they lacked the confidence to run on such an unorthodox claim. The emerging new middle-out consensus finally offers an empirical and theoretical foundation to back it up. What we are seeing in the policies of Biden and Harris and in their rejection of neoliberal orthodoxy is the coalescing of a truly centrist economics that, in Harris’s words, is not “constrained by ideology.” If many of these policies appear to lean to the ideological left, it is merely out of “pragmatic” consideration for how modern market economies work best, and for the indispensable role of government in assuring that they work for everybody. “What makes an economic policy distinctively centrist,” wrote the political scientist Damon Linker in 2019, “is its capacity to speak to the concerns of the broadest possible slice of the electorate—while remaining at all times keenly aware of the main points of fracture in contemporary public opinion.” The key, wrote Linker, “is to follow public opinion wherever it leads,” even when it diverges from that of the neoliberal elites of both parties. “If this centrist agenda sounds like something many progressives would applaud or at least view as a good start, that’s because the new center takes its economic cues from the left side of the traditional spectrum.” When members of the old guard pitch Biden’s exit as an “opportunity” for Democrats to reclaim the center, what they’re really pitching is an opportunity for the neoliberal ancien régime to reclaim the Democratic Party for themselves. But Harris can’t move to the center, because she’s already there. It’s just a different center than the one we’ve been taught to think about. It’s her neoliberal critics who are extreme.

Title: Nvidia Eclipses Microsoft As World’s Second-Largest Company As Stock Climbs To 6-Week High

Nvidia stock rallied Monday despite a broader down day on Wall Street for its big technology peers, boosting the artificial intelligence heavyweight to reclaim its spot as the second-largest company in the world amid the AI boom. Nvidia's centibillionaire CEO Jensen Huang speaks last month at a Washington, D.C., conference. Nvidia notched its highest intraday share price since Aug. 26 at $130.64, with shares up about 4.2% by mid-afternoon. The Silicon Valley firm accordingly registered its highest market capitalization since August, and its $3.19 trillion market value sent it past Microsoft ($3.07 trillion) as the world’s second-largest company for the first time in six weeks; Nvidia now only trails Apple’s $3.4 trillion valuation. Nvidia stock’s strong start to the week came despite broader losses, as the S&P 500 slipped 0.6% as higher bond yields and oil prices ate into the equity boost from shifting U.S. monetary policy. Shares of all five trillion-dollar tech companies other than Nvidia fell Monday, with Apple down 1.3%, Microsoft 0.7%, Google parent Alphabet 1.4%, Amazon 2.8% and Facebook parent Meta 0.9%. Nvidia, which designs a full suite of custom AI technology intended for high-end applications like large-language models, benefitted Monday from fellow AI tech maker Super Micro Computer’s announcement that sales for its liquid cooling products deployed alongside Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) was strong this quarter. Another bullish analyst note also boosted shares, as Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes wrote to clients the “setup here is still pretty darn good” for Nvidia stock even as it enjoys an extended bounce. “Strong AI spending” from the likes of Microsoft, Alphabet and ChatGPT parent OpenAI should “catalyze consumption” of Nvidia’s core (GPUs), according to Reitzes. The demand optimism follows continued comments from Nvidia’s centibillionaire CEO Jensen Huang insisting demand for its AI products is “so great” and “insane.” Monday is a continuation of a month-long period of outsized returns for Nvidia, as its 26% return since Sept. 6 trounces the S&P’s 6% gain during the period and its five trillion-dollar peers’ 7% average gain. Nvidia was briefly the world’s largest company in June, when its share price peaked at a still-record $140.76. Previously a fairly low-profile company known for its video game business, Nvidia became a Wall Street darling as its profits skyrocketed amid the generative AI boom. Nvidia’s valuation has increased tenfold over the past two years. $21.9 billion. That’s how much in adjusted profits Nvidia is expected to report in its fiscal quarter ending this month, according to average analyst forecasts tracked by FactSet. That’s a more than 80% year-over-year increase in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and a more than 1,000% jump from 2022’s comparable period. One Community.

Title: Rabbit CEO Jesse Lyu isn’t thinking too far ahead

By Nilay Patel, editor-in-chief of The Verge, host of the Decoder podcast, and co-host of The Vergecast. Today, I’m talking with Jesse Lyu, the founder and CEO of Rabbit. The startup company makes the adorable r1 AI gadget — a little handheld designed by superstar design firm Teenage Engineering. It’s meant to be how you talk to an AI agent, which then goes off onto the internet and does things for you, from playing music on Spotify and ordering an Uber to even buying things on Amazon. Rabbit launched with a lot of hype at CES and a big party in New York, but early reviews of the device were universally bad. Our own David Pierce gave it a 3 out of 10 in May, saying that most of the features don’t work or don’t even exist. And the core feature that didn’t seem to exist was the most important of all: Rabbit’s large action model, or LAM, which is meant to allow the system to open a web browser in the cloud and browse for you. The LAM is supposed to intelligently understand what it’s looking at on a website and literally click around to accomplish tasks on your behalf. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! There have been a lot of questions about just how real Rabbit’s LAM was, but the company finally launched what it calls the LAM Playground, which lets people use a bare-bones version of the system. It does indeed appear to be clicking around on the web, although it is very slow. So, I wanted to know how Jesse planned to invest in the LAM and compete with other AI agents that promise to do things for you. For example, Microsoft just announced a new agent-y version of Copilot, and Apple’s vision for the next generation of Siri is an AI agent — and it’ll run on your phone and have direct access to those apps and your data inside them. It’s the same with Google and Gemini and Amazon’s rumored next generation of Alexa. This is major competition for a startup, and Jesse talked about wanting to get out ahead of it. But really, I wanted to know how Rabbit’s system works and whether it’s durable — not just technically, which is challenging, but also from a business and legal perspective. After all, if Rabbit’s idea works and the LAM really does go and browse websites for you… what’s stopping companies like Spotify and DoorDash from blocking it? You might have a strong point of view here — Jesse certainly does — but at some point, there’s going to be a fight about this, and it’s not clear what’s going to happen. To put this in historical context, about a decade ago, a handful of startups tried to stream broadcast television without licenses by putting a bunch of antennas in a single location and building apps that let people access them. This felt technically legal — what’s the difference between all those people having their own antennas and putting all those antennas in a single place and those accessing them over the internet? Some of these companies were seriously innovative — the most famous was a company called Aereo, which spent a ton of money designing specialized TV antennas the size of a nickel so it could pack as many of them into a data center as possible. I wrote about Aereo back then — visited the antenna floor, interviewed the CEO, the whole thing. Aereo then got sued by the TV networks, the case went to the Supreme Court in 2014, and you will note that Aereo no longer exists. I don’t know if Rabbit is another Aereo, and I don’t know how all these companies will react to having robots browse their websites instead of people. And I certainly don’t know how legal systems around the world will handle the inevitable lawsuits to come. I asked Jesse about all of this, and you’ll hear his answer: he thinks Rabbit will be so successful that these companies will want to show up and make deals. I have to say, I don’t know about that, either. I do know that this is a pretty intense and occasionally contentious interview. Jesse didn’t back down, and that means we got pretty deep into it. Let me know what you think. Okay, Jesse Lyu, founder and CEO of Rabbit. Here we go. The following transcript was edited for clarity. Jesse Lyu, you’re the founder and CEO of Rabbit. Welcome to Decoder. Thank you, Nilay. Glad to be here. I’m very excited to talk to you. Rabbit is a fascinating company. The idea for the r1 product is fascinating. I think a lot of people think that something that looks like the r1 is the next evolution of smartphones or products or something. And then there’s the company itself, which is really interesting, and you’ve got a connection to Teenage Engineering, which is one of our favorite companies here at The Verge. So, just a lot to talk about. And you’ve got some news to share about opening up Rabbit’s Large Action Model so people can play with it, and it’s kind of an early version. I really want to talk about that. But let’s start with Rabbit itself. The company has not been around that long. The r1 just started shipping six months ago. What is Rabbit? How’d the company start? Long story short, it’s a very young company. So here’s a little bit of history of it. I actually started a AI company back in 2013, which was called Raven Tech, and we were at YC Winter ‘15 batch. And it’s basically my personal dream to chase this grand vision that, I guess, me being this generation, growing up, we watched so many sci-fi movies, there’s AI stuff here and there. And I guess every geek wants to build their own Jarvis at some point. So I think that’s exactly how I started Raven Tech 11, 12 years ago. And back then, we had this idea, we had this direction, but the technology back then — obviously, there wasn’t like GPU training, there weren’t transformers and stuff. So we worked really hard on the early days of voice dictation and NLP and NLU, which is natural language processing and natural language understanding. So the technology wasn’t there, but we tried our best. We actually built and entire cloud system and the hardware, which is similar to what we have in Rabbit today. But the form factor was more of a smart speaker — as we all know back 10 years ago, everyone was chasing that form factor. Ultimately, the company got acquired, so it’s not a new idea for myself, but it’s definitely a new opportunity that when I saw the progress on the research side, the transformer, obviously, [when] I got a chance to try ChatGPT, or GPT’s API. We were really impressed because we felt the timing is right. Because being able to do something like r1 or more sci-fi, Jarvis stuff, you really need to figure out two parts from the back end. One is that you want to make sure that by talking to the device, the computer or device actually understand what you’re talking about, which is the transformer, the large language model part. But we believe at around 2020, 2021, we believe that the transformer is absolutely the right path that opening, other companies are heading to. We believe that portion has been solved, will be solved. So our focus immediately shifted to: after this device can understand you, can it actually help you do things? And the company that I started 10, 11 years ago, Raven Tech, we were actually one of the first company that designed a cloud API structure. After the [voice] recognition, after the understanding, the query got sent into different APIs. The system has a detector to understand, “Oh, maybe you are looking for a restaurant on Yelp. Maybe you want to play a song from this streaming software.” But I guess 10 years ago, there’s a great opportunity of APIs. There are a lot of company working on APIs. And if you remember 10 years ago in Silicon Valley, everyone was talking about maybe in the future the entire operating system will be just HTML5. Right? But that didn’t live quite long. I think now when we’re looking after 2020, the API business is not really major business for most of the popular services. So we also want to take an evaluation of whether we can build a generic piece of agent technology, which is really hard. Because I believe the current AI is all generic. Obviously, there’s a lot of people doing vertical stuff. Right? You can build an agent for Excel. You can build an agent for legal documentation process. But I think the biggest dream, what’s really make us excited is the generic part of it. It’s like, can we build something that without pre-training, without knowing people want to do what, and they just talk whatever they want, and we’ll be able to smart enough to handle all the tasks. So that’s why we felt the opportunity was right, and we started Rabbit right after COVID. The idea that agents are going to be a big part of our life, and in particular general purpose agents that go take actions for us on the internet — I’ve heard this idea from all kinds of folks, from startup founders like yourself to the CEOs of the biggest companies in the world. I want to come back to that. That’s a big idea, but I just want to stay focused on Rabbit for a second. How many people work at Rabbit today? I believe at the current moment, we’re roughly around 50 people, 50 to 60 people if we plus the interns. But when we started, the company was seven, and by the time we launched as CES it was 17. So just by growing the team within four or five months, it was quite a challenging job for me. So CES was the big launch. We were there, David Pierce was at the party. The Rabbit was introduced. You gave demos in a hotel room, I think. And then you had the launch party here at the TWA Hotel at JFK, which is very cool. The thing’s been out, but you’ve been growing. You said you started at 17 people in January at CES, and you have 50 now. What are you adding all those people to do? Most of it’s just engineers. We have a very small group of design, hardware design or ID that we started from day one, and most of the new folks are working on AI and infrastructure perspective, like cloud basically. We not only ship the hardware. We build the entire Rabbit OS for it. So I think the major work is always going to be in the software part. How is the whole company structured? As you go from seven to 17 to 50, you obviously have to decide how to structure Rabbit. How is that structured now? How has it changed? We are primarily located in Santa Monica. We have a device team of really great folks in the Bay Area, and we have a couple of research engineers here and there. So it’s kind of mostly in person, but a somewhat hybrid system. And the way that we find our people is mostly by internal referring. So we’re not spending money chasing for agents, agencies to do the hiring. Most of the good folks, we basically do internal recommendation. But your 50 people that you have now, how is that organized inside the company? It’s really flat in a sense. We have different departments, obviously. The hardware ODM/OEM part is in Asia. We have our ID team in collaboration with folks in Stockholm.,Teenage Engineering in this case. And we do our own graphics and marketing, all of that in house. And then for the software part, we have the device team that they need to work with the ODM/OEM. And we have the cloud team, we have the AI team. That’s basically how much team we have. And each team, there’s obviously crossovers, and we basically work project-based. So there is no crazy hierarchy going on. I mean, the biggest company I ever led was back in the Raven days. I believe by the time we got acquired, we were 250 people. So this is still within my comfort zone, to manage 50-ish people. Teenage Engineering is a big part of the Rabbit story. They obviously designed the r1 hardware, and then their founder, Jesper Kouthoofd, is your chief design officer. How much more hardware are you designing right now? Are there iterations to come? Do you have a roadmap of new products? The way we work together — obviously this is not the first time we’ve collaborated. We did a collaboration back in Raven days. First of all, Teenage Engineering is my hero company. It’s basically a fanboy dream come true story for me, and I really appreciate their help over the years. The way that we work together is very intuitive. There are obviously many ways that could be considered to be the proper way of designing a project like this, but I think we’re out of the ordinary way of doing this — I can give you an example. Back in the Raven days, all we did is that we had probably two meetings in person, a couple of phone calls, no email, no text messages. We set up a secret Instagram account that we just used to share sketches, and we just hit like on our Instagram accounts, and that’s how we designed the previous Raven project. This time, it was even quicker. I think I shared this publicly. I think we spent probably 10 minutes on deciding how the r1’s going to look like, and we had quick sketches here and there. Ultimately, I pushed Jesper for using the current color, which is the orange. We do have maybe two or three projects in our minds, but I think by the end of this year, our current focus is to really get this LAM pushed to the next level. So yeah, stay tuned. I think one thing people will realize is that this team does hardware really quick. Because when we start sketching the r1, it was like last year back in November, and we introduced that by January, and we start shipping by April. So if we want to launch the next project, it’s going to be roughly, I don’t know, six to eight months timeframe. Certainly not like a year or two. But that being said, I think... I was having my own community voice chat yesterday. I was talking to people about the current r1 because I really don’t like the current consumer electronics. Like, one year per generation by default, regardless. We’ve seen that from the smartphone companies doing annual release for all this stuff with minor changes. When we started designing the r1, the entire Rabbit OS runs out of cloud. That means that this piece of hardware, even though it’s $199 and not the latest chips, it’s really capable of offloading the future features to this device. So I don’t think r1 is like a one-year lifespan device. Our community does, though. They think they can tweak so many things about it. So in that sense, we’re not in a rush to drop another version of it, but we do have different form factors in our mind at the moment. And is Jesper actively working on those designs, or as chief design officer, is he working on something else? He was literally in our office three days ago. Yeah, we are actively working together. Correct. How much money have you raised so far? That’s a good question. I want to be accurate, but it’s somewhere around $50 million total in the whole lifespan. Last part was $35 million led by Sound Venture and also Khosla Venture, and Amazon Alexa, Foundation Synergist. So last round was $35M, and if you consider all the money together, I think it’s around $50M. When I look at the amount of money that other AI companies are going out to raise, right as we are speaking, OpenAI just raised the biggest round ever in history to go build, obviously, a foundation model, digital god, whatever Sam Altman thinks he’s doing. Do you think you can compete at $35 million a round? No, but I think talking about competition — money is one part of it. I think I’ve considered myself a veteran because I’ve done startups before. I know how it works. Certainly, money is very important, probably most important in the early couple of years. But I think when we talk about competition, we ultimately want to ship products to consumers. Because the way I look at it is that people are not buying electricity. Electricity is basically controlled by — here in California, it’s Southern California Edison, right? You have an address, you have to pay for it regardless of how much electricity you’re using. But I think people are ultimately buying microwaves, cars, motorcycles, televisions. People are buying products powered by electricity. So research-wise, I can say very clearly, we have at this moment of Rabbit, there’s no way that we can compete over OpenAI, Anthropic, and DeepMind and Google, but how can we play the game? We become partners with everyone. Right? So r1 is hosting every single model, the latest models from these guys. Their capabilities combined with our product innovation on the Rabbit OS and all the features offered to our user. So there’s no way we can compete over on a research perspective, but we ship product fast. You saw OpenAI just released the Instant API, as they call it. I was actually invited to the meeting, but I was launching the LAM Playground yesterday, so I couldn’t be there in person. But they’re offering an API for people to build an agent for it. But yesterday, we dropped a LAM Playground, which you can go to any website and just [browse] it by voice. So I think competition is a different magnitude. I think money is definitely important. We hope that we can raise more money, of course. But I think right now, if you talk about competition, we have to play smart. They are good on the research. We are good on converting all the latest research into a piece of product that users can use today. Let’s talk about what that product is today. So right now you have the r1. You can buy it. It’s a beautiful piece of hardware. It is orange. It is very striking. It has a screen, it has a scroll dial, and then it has a connection to your service in the cloud, which goes and does stuff for you. Yep. That costs $199. Are you making money on the sale of each individual r1 unit right now? Correct. What’s the margin? What’s your profit on r1? I have my r1 right here. It’s a very good margin, even though I cannot tell you the details, but it’s over 40 percent. Do you make over 40 percent on the hardware margin of the r1? On hardware margin, which we did the math, we run the calculations. We might have to redo the math because yesterday, literally after dropping the LAN Playground, the server crashed multiple times. So we might need to redo the calculation. But again, first of all, in the beginning we’re making money. Now we have these more powerful features moving forward. I think I haven’t heard a company that went bankrupt because they got a popular service that is so popular that they couldn’t afford cloud bills. I think if you build a good product, there will be — Well, hold on, I can draw that line for you. So it’s $199. You’re making over 40 percent per unit, so that’s between $80 and $90, right? It’s not 50 percent, which would be $100, so it’s a little less. So between $80 and $90 in margin. That margin — you do have to pay your cloud bills, right? Yeah. So is that margin all being fed into your cloud bills? Obviously, we have this dedicated instance with all these cloud competitors. Right? I mean, don’t get me wrong. The Amazon AWS, they’re hosting on AWS, and there’s AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure. On the LLM partnerships, we have Anthropic, OpenAI and Gemini. So don’t get me wrong, it — That’s a lot of companies that like to make a lot of money. I just want to be... They’re not cheap to partner with, all those companies. They’re not cheap, but what I’m trying to point out is that they are competing so fiercely in a way that they have a lot of good benefits for the early startups. I have to shout out for all these companies. So they really want to figure out a way to help you on board and maybe making your money in the long run, but I think at this current scale, we can totally handle it, yes. So we get great deals from them. So if I buy an r1 from you, you take $90 of margin, or $80 of margin. At what point, how much do I have to use my r1 to turn that negative for you? Because everything I do with an AI, that’s a token. That token costs money. It costs multiple servers. Your bandwidth cost money. It all costs money. How much does a single r1 user have to use their r1 to take up $90 of margin, or $80 of margin from you? So I think of a moderate user using it in a non-robotic way or a non-malicious way, it’s going to be really hard to break down. But — Is that two years worth of usage? One year? Six months? I think it’s definitely over a year and a half. I’m not sure about two years because there’s new features we’re going to implement into this, including LAM Playground and teach mode. But yeah, so I want to share my understanding of this is that yes, we did the mathematics. We are making money. No problem. We wish we can sell more, which we’re hoping that we can sell more. That’s going to definitely help. But I think the target of this whole launch strategy is not set for making X amount of money on first six months. I think there’s other companies that really greedy about how they want to launch their product. I’m not going to even mention a name, so that won’t work. That won’t work. So I think if you look at any new generation of product, if the founder and the company and the board decide to set up a strategy that’s, “Let’s squeeze every single penny out of the user,” it’s not going to work. Because we know AI is very early, and we know that there’s going to be a lot of things that go wrong. In fact, I believe that every company, regardless of if you’re big or small, if you work on the latest AI stuff, the first two weeks, it’s going to be disaster because you’re going to find a lot of the misbehavior about the AI. You’re going to find a lot of the edge cases by the model. So I think the whole thing is too new. There’s no way that we want to charge for subscription. That’s even worse. I don’t like that strategy in general. So even though this sounds very concerning, that, okay, you can easily twist my story or someone might twist my story, be like, “Oh, Rabbit is doing everything great except they’re going bankrupt no matter what” right? I think there’s a very stupid way to think in that sense, because a great innovation, you have to focus on the innovative part first. Then you figure out the money part. If we start figuring out the money part now, none of this is making sense. Really. None of this is making sense. I think there’s other people in the industry that they have a great understanding of everything, and then they decided to release a wallpaper app, charge $4.50 per month. Right? Hopefully that works, I guess. You can go talk to that guy and you say, “Hey, there’s no way you’re going to bankrupt because your money checks, all this equation checks. If you charge for this, you’re going to be making money.” But that’s based on the perspective that the whole logic needs to stand up, right? So I think I’m not really wasting a lot of my time at this point on trying to basically fine tune a little about mathematical equations to make this more like, 20 percent, 50 percent. Obviously, as a startup, we need to survive, even though we have a roller coaster ride since launch. But we’re growing, and we’re surviving, and we’re still pushing the features that none of the other devices, including iPhone can do, which is a very, very good sign. So one, I don’t think anybody has ever linked criticism of Humane to criticism of Marques’ wallpaper app on our show before. Well done. I think Marques has a very different view of where his expertise is and what went wrong with that app and maybe one day we’ll talk to him about it. But my question for you, when you talk about growth and you talk about the unit economics of the Rabbit is that on some curve, the hardware becomes unprofitable for you. Just me having a Rabbit for longer than 18 months becomes unprofitable for you. That’s the moment that you would charge a subscription. You would say “to continue using this thing, it can’t be negative for our company.” And that’s the thing that I’m pushing on here. I think there are multiple solutions to that question. One is that obviously — let’s use R1 for every user for more than 18 months. There’s a couple of solutions. One is that we are going to launch the next generation device, and maybe multiple devices, that are still profitable from the hardware. Two, I think we have this prepared for since day one. From last week we’ve rolled out the alpha of Teach Mode to a very selected group of testers. I would love to give you the access, so please reach out to us later on. We’ll see if we can help you set it up. But we rolled out a very small group of our testers, roughly around 20, 25 people to be honest. And then over the last 72 hours I saw more than probably 200, more than 200 lessons or agents has been created through Teach mode. And if you look at the current Apple ecosystem or Android ecosystem, I think the hardware is not going to be the number one money contributor. It’s really hard to make on top of the margin of the hardware anyway. So at some point you want to convert that into services and software. That doesn’t mean that you’re going to charge a subscription for the device. What I think is very promising is that we are going to slowly roll out the teach mode to beta testers and hopefully by the end of this year we can grand open the teach mode as we promised on day one. So all these lessons created or Rabbits or agents created by each independent users or developers, they can be considered as a new generation of an app store. On that, we can make big money. Using the app store economics of taking 30 percent. I don’t want to invent any — exactly. I think I’m not trying to invent any new business model. I think as a startup it’s very risky to invent your own business model, but there is a very great business model out there which is App Store and that’s contributing like what, 70 percent for the annual income, right? I’m just curious, just as I’ve played with r1s and looked at the device, I’ve always wondered how on earth are you making money at $199? So that makes sense to me. When you think about what the Rabbit is actually doing, I ask it a query, it shows me a beautiful animation on the screen, which is adorable, and it goes off into the web and uses a bunch of APIs. And now the new large action model, which is the news, right? Yesterday you announced the large action model playground. People can watch it work. I’ve seen the LAM click around on The Verge’s website just to read headlines, which is neat. Is that the back end of this, I ask the Rabbit to do something and in the cloud it goes and clicks around on the web for me? So we have to separate two different systems here, maybe three different systems here. Let’s talk before yesterday, because yesterday is really a great milestone. Before yesterday, what happens is that you talk to the r1. We have an intention triage system, which basically we convert this audio to a text, we send that text to our LLM providers, and then we have an intention triage system. From there, after the LLM understand the intention we send to different APIs or different features. There are a lot of feature which is on device, right? Like set a smart timer or something like that. Or there’s a simple question, but we think that there’s other services or model probably answers better than the default LLM. So sometimes we send a particular query to Perplexity. Sometimes we send a particular query to Wolfram Alpha. So you can understand as intention triage system is dispensing on this to different destinations and then the relative features will trigger. But after yesterday, we have this playground and that’s a first stepping stone towards what we really want to create, which is a generic cross-platform agent system. It has to be generic, which on this case it is a generic. It is not cross-platform yet because it handles only a website. It will be cross-platform very soon. But with this generic website agent system, essentially you can just talk to Rabbit, be like, “Hey, go to ABC website or go somewhere and then help me do this.” So that’s exactly how we wish to design a product, and I think everyone in the industry is heading towards this direction, which is you say something, we understand you and we help you do it. And what happens as we put windows on the Rabbit hole that you can see is that the agent will break down different steps. I’m going to Google first. I’m searching for The Verge, I’m clicking to The Verge’s home website. I’m trying to find this title as you requested. I’m clicking the button to share this. And in theory you can chain multiple steps, infinite steps, follow up queries to the system. So I’ll gave you an example. I think I showed this to another reporter, it’s “hey, go to Reddit first and search for what are people recommending for the 2024 best TV 4K HDR. Get that model, then go to Best Buy, add that to my cart. If Best Buy is out of stock, then search on Amazon. If they both are out of stock, get me the second recommended model.” So you can actually chain different queries and you can pause it, you can add, you can tweak it, you can fine tune it. So it’s really just like a playground. You can freely explore the system and the system is fairly good enough to do daily tasks. And people are obviously developers and our hackers — white hat hackers of course — are giving us impressive showcases. There are people using the LAM playground to create an app just by talking to r1 because there are third party AI destinations that you can just use prompt and create an app and download the code and stuff like that. So it’s really amazing to see all this great showcases just within actually precisely 24 hours. So I want to make the marker between yesterday and the day before it, right? You announced the Rabbit at CES in January with the LAM, but it wasn’t there. Why announce it without its fundamental enabling feature? It is not accurate. I want to take this opportunity to address that. If you go to the connections, now we have seven apps. By day one we have four apps. Those are the first iteration of LAM, which is not a generic technology. We never on the CES claimed that you can now go to Amazon to order something. We said we are working towards this piece and today there’s four apps that you can connect. We are going to add more services. And over the past couple of months we did add three more services. So as of today there are seven services in total, then we keep working on the current LAM Playground and when the time is right, we swap it. So there’s a lot of debate saying LAM wasn’t there. That is not true. I can trace back to where this rumor starts is where there are people hacking into the r1. They saw r1 is fundamentally powered by an Android system on the local device, and obviously that should be the case. It would be more sketchy if it’s not Android. So at the bottom of it is an Android system and they dump the code, which — you can do that. In fact, every good piece of hardware in history has been hacked. So someone goes into this and jailbreaks the r1, which I guess every piece of hardware is jailbreakable at some point. Obviously, that’s flattering to us. If you build a form factor and no one even bothered to jailbreak it, it’s probably not a good form factor anyway. So people jailbreak it, find out the Android code, they dump the Android code to another media and they say, hey, there’s nothing about AI here. There’s nothing about LAM here. Of course, because all the stuff is in AWS. That’s where the rumor starts. And then there’s a lot of media and they just take that piece and reiterate that. The apps you started with, Spotify, DoorDash, there are a few others. Those are APIs, right? You were using their APIs. You were actually opening Spotify on the web in Chrome and clicking on it. Yes. Yes. Because what do you mean — Why? There is no API — That’s the most brittle way to use Spotify I can think of — There is no API. There is no API. You made a smart speaker. Spotify can run on smart speakers and other kinds — That’s a partnership. That’s a partnership. Go to Spotify, read their documentations. There is a specific line is that you cannot use API to build a voice-activated application. Literally. So Spotify right now on the r1, when I ask to play a song, it goes and opens Spotify on the web somewhere — Goes to the window. Yes. And then you’re re-streaming the audio to my device through your service. Correct. Correct. Yes. Does Spotify know that you’re doing this? Yes. And they’re okay with that? We had a conversation. They realize this is agent behavior. And we said, look, we ask the user to log in on your website and they’re a 100 percent legitimate user and they’re a paid user. And when we do the trick, we help them click the button. I’ve always been very curious about this. I’ve been dying to ask you these questions. So I ask my r1 to play a song. Somewhere in AWS, a virtual machine fires up, opens a web browser, opens Spotify, logs into my Spotify account using my credentials, clicks around on Spotify, pushes a button to play a song, and then you capture that audio and re-stream it to me on my r1? Everything is accurate except we don’t help you log in. You have to log in for yourself and we don’t save your connection. But the part where you are re-streaming audio that Spotify is playing to your virtual machine to me, you’re doing that? We are basically giving everyone a virtual machine, which is a VNC, which is 100 percent within policy, and you have the right to access that VNC. And on that VNC, we basically work directly on a website just like today’s LAM Playground. So we’re not getting the audio from the server from Spotify or somewhere else. We’re basically going to the Spotify website and playing — and do the things for you and play that song for you. Okay, but where do the bits go? The bits come to the virtual machine and then they come from the virtual machine to my Rabbit. Correct. So you are re-streaming the song to me. I’m not re-streaming the song to you. I’m basically presenting the VNC directly to your r1. Wait, explain how that works. Maybe I’m not technical enough to understand how that works. You’re presenting the VNC to my r1. Correct. So it is running locally on my computer? With no UI. Okay, I see what you mean. So I’m logged into a cloud computer. The r1 is the client to a cloud computer. And Spotify is playing on that cloud computer and the r1 is taking that audio. Okay. That raises a million extra questions, right? First of all, I see where you’re going. Okay? Before you go deeper, I just want to say first of all, we’re not using API. Second of all to say LAM is not there, that’s false claim. Because we have all these services, if you really pay attention to their documentation, there is no API for like DoorDash. There is no API for Uber. But I just want to be clear, that’s a choice those companies have made to prevent companies like Rabbit from automating their services and disintermediating their services from the user. So as you think about these agent models going out onto the web, however they’re expressed, whether it’s the LAM, whether it’s whatever you’re doing before the LAM Playground hit, all of those companies are going to have a point of view on whether agents can use their services in this way. That’s pretty unsettled. Yes. And I’m curious, you have a few services, they might’ve just said, okay, let’s see how this goes. But over time you’re going to enter into a much more complicated set of negotiations that will actually be probably determined by the big companies making deals, right? You can see how OpenAI or Microsoft or Amazon would make a deal to have DoorDash accessible by agents and DoorDash would say, “we’ve made this deal, you can’t be accessible.” How do you solve that problem? It’s not a problem for now. We’ll see how this problem evolves, but I remember when Apple is relatively not so big, not as big as today. When I read the Steve Jobs book, there’s one chapter. He said, okay, “go talk to Sony, from tomorrow 99 cents per track,” right? Remember that moment? So at some point this level of negotiation needs to be happening. I’m not sure if we’re leading this or someone else is leading this, but this is the working proof that we’re not using API, and I don’t think the services are not building API just because they’re trying to prevent people from automating the company. It’s just because API to them is not making money. And they for sure will love to set up a negotiation in some phase later when we grow bigger. You know, we tried to reach out to Uber, we did, before launch. They were like, “who are you? You’re too small.” That’s it. “We don’t care.” And so then you have Uber on the r1 now, that’s opening the Uber desktop app? No, the Uber website, which is very janky, which is very — That’s what I’m asking. Sorry. What I meant by desktop app is in the web browser you’re calling an Uber. If you’re running on Android, why not open an Android virtual machine and use the Android app? It is a little bit more technical to achieve that, which we are working on the other platforms. I think I showed a vary select group of people a working prototype that LAM is operating on the desktop OS such as Linux with all the local apps. So we’re definitely heading in that direction. Is there a possibility they can detect the fact that these are not human users, but in fact agent users? I guess there’s always a way that you can detect, but I think the question is — this is actually a very good topic that we’re talking about here. Think about CAPTCHAs. Sure. LAM playground or any capable AI models now can go there and solve text-based CAPTCHAs. So their old systems to prevent automated systems like this are currently failing. This is an industry effort to push everyone in the industry to rethink about — now with this AI, now with all these agents, how their business is going to reform or how all these policies need to be changed? I do agree, this is a very complicated topic, but what I can see is that this is not Rabbit doing some really fancy magic here. Every company is doing this. We have other agent companies even the GPTs are doing this. So this is a new wave emerging for all this old services that they have to think about. But I can tell you my personal experience dealing with scenarios like this, like when we first started building one of the first smart speakers back in 2013 — all this music labels, they don’t care. They didn’t care until everyone’s building smart speakers, they’re like, ‘okay, we have to resell the whole copyrights for this particular form factor.” I guess at the end of day, it’s about money. They want to sell the same copyrights to as many form factories as they want, if there’s a popular one. So we’re okay to have this kind of negotiations, but certainly like you said, there’s bigger companies that are doing similar things or even more advanced things that needs to be addressed. I give you another example like Siri and Microsoft, there’s a feature called Microsoft Recall, which they pulled back that feature now and I think they relaunched it. Which is very aggressive, that is taking screenshots of your local computer. So this is what I saw happening in AI in these early days. There’s going to be a lot of different takes and tries and eventually people will reconcile and agree on single piece of terms and agreements. But if you check how we automate the website to their interface, the most important part is we don’t create fake users. We don’t create spam users. We don’t log in on your behalf and you are you. The way I help you to do things is by help you click the buttons and mouse. It’s equivalent of, if I want my buddy to help me — I’ll give you example. So if I’m busy, I’m about to head into a meeting, I want my buddy to help me order a burger from DoorDash. All I need to do is I unlock my phone, I pass my phone to my guy and my guy helped me click that. And in this process, I’m not sharing my credentials to my buddy. I’m not telling him my phone password, I’m not telling him my DoorDash password. I’m not even sharing my credit card info. All he has to do is just add to the cart and click confirm. That’s it. So this guy is the equivalent of the first generation of LAM, which is unfortunately we don’t like it. So that’s why we work so hard. Now we have Playground, which is a more generic technology. Well, let me ask you about that difference between the first generation of LAM and the playground. The playground sounds like the thing you’ve always wanted to build. You actually have an agent that can look at web pages, understand them, take action on them. The first one, it might have been a LAM in the broader definition, but as technology it was expressed as testing software that was moving in an automated way through these interfaces. You weren’t actually understanding the interfaces. You were able to just navigate them. Because that’s pretty normal robotic process automation stuff. Were you just building on that kind of technology while the LAM came into existence? No, no. No? Okay. We’re working on neuro-symbolic, right? So the idea is that — But even in the first versions? Yeah. The question I’ve always had is, what happens if Spotify — before the LAM existed because I understand that the claim is that this version can understand every website — but if Spotify changed its interface or DoorDash changed its interface, Rabbit was kind of getting tripped up, right? I’ll tell you, Spotify changes its interface all the time and I think in the past six months, five months since the first LAM was adding the Spotify with the connection since launch. I think we probably put Spotify under maintenance for maybe two times, one hour in total. That’s a very hard proof. That’s a hard proof, but I — just take this for what it’s worth, I think that means it’s not good enough, right? The Spotify app on my phone never goes down for maintenance, and if the claim is the agent can go take actions for me, I have to rely on that at 100 percent. No — And so I think the question for me that I have, this whole thing, is the delta between what you want to do, which is have agents go and crawl the web for me and the reality of what we can do now. Actually the middle ground is APIs, the middle ground is not so brittle. You — Okay — It makes more sense to me that the agent would, instead of using an interface designed for my eyes, use an interface designed for computers. I really want to laugh hard. Okay. Really. Two things. I disagree that Spotify is not working good. Spotify has been working amazing. Sure. Five months, maybe two times we put it under maintenance and the total amount of time put under maintenance is probably under one hour. You can ask any r1 users. That’s not through API, which is impressive. That’s through agent. I’m — That’s through agent to handle to — I get that it’s impressive for an agent. I’m just saying that API — You said it’s not — I said it’s not — You said it’s not good. Good enough. I said it’s not good enough. It is not good enough. Right? Where’s the curve where it’s 100 percent? Okay, now that’s my — Because the API is 100 percent. That’s my second part. Yes, API is 100 percent, but you’re relying on, they gave you the API that’s stable, that works, that never break- I’m the user, I don’t care. That’s what I’m getting at: as the user, why should I care? The user doesn’t need to care. We need to care. Okay. We need to care and we need to care because we checked what are the good APIs we can use, don’t get me wrong, Perplexity API’s has being great. Sure. OpenAI’s API breaks every day or two and they said , “We observe an issue.” You can follow the, Is ChatGPT Down? It’s very detailed, how many breaks per day, it’s, I guess more than 10 on average that the ChatGPT API breaks or is unstable, whatever it takes. We have a notifier. So, first of all, API is not stable. It is not stable. Sure. And you have to chase for the services people want. We want to offer this music feature and we think Spotify has the best experience overall, and we want to chase for this partnership and we’re still chasing for this partnership. But to talk from a technical perspective, why I said I don’t like APIs is because — think about Alexa. Alexa speakers are all using APIs and you literally have to go there and negotiate. Because like I said, today, not everyone’s opening APIs, a lot of the traditional services don’t have APIs, and then startups, for a startup it’s impossible. wWen you go talk to them, they think you’re too small, right? We did that, we just did that to everyone. They think we’re too small, they don’t care, so we can’t get an API, Does that mean that we’re not going to figure out an alternative way to make it work? No, hell no! We’re going to make it work and this is exactly how we make it work. So we care about users to use this feature. We don’t care about how to do it. In fact, because we know that you don’t care how this has been done, I don’t want to spend six months, eight months suited up to talk to Spotify people and Uber people, and one by one, let’s do that. Well the promise here is you’re going to eventually have a general purpose LAM that is just using the web for you, right? You said you hand your phone to a buddy, which is why you can make the Rabbit device and just talk to it and it goes off and does stuff in the general case. The enormous Death Star that everyone sees is that Apple has announced substantially the same feature for Siri on the iPhone. Yeah. And Apple can get the deals and Apple can pull developers into an API relationship locally on the phone with Siri, and Apple honestly can just burn money until it chooses not to build a car or whatever it wants to do. And getting people to buy another device that doesn’t just fall back to the Spotify app on iOS when it breaks seems very challenging. How do you overcome that? Because if the technology isn’t 100 percent better 100 percent of the time, that feels like a challenging sale. Yeah, this is the fun part of the game, really. How do you win the game? I think, first of all, speaking for myself, I’ve sold my company before when I was 25. I don’t want to build another app. I should chase my same dream because I really think that the grand vision that I have and our team was working on is actually the current direction everyone’s chasing. And it just feels so bad if you don’t chase the same dream no matter how hard it is, really, and in reality, we feel blessed and happy to say the exact situation because we don’t have any serious competitors from startups to be honest. When everyone — Well there’s one, and they seem like a pretty spectacular failure, right? Yes. Humane launched with a lot of money and a big T-Mobile partnership and a subscription fee and Time magazine and all that stuff and it doesn’t seem like that has gone very well. So I said as of right now I don’t think we have serious competitors from startup and then when we talk about competitors, obviously there’s Apple, there’s every big company out there, including OpenAI. So first of all, I think this is good for us because it validates our direction is absolutely correct and I also am curious about — what are going to be the definitive routes for the generic agent technology because different people in the industry might have different ideas. There are still debatable states, there is no eval for agent systems yet, there is no very good eval yet, and you can see a lot of different research houses and companies trying different routes. Obviously there’s API routes like GPT’s, which doesn’t really take off, there’s pure neuro-symbolic routes, there’s Haber routes, there’s all this multi-modality. So we’re still in the phase of everyone trying their own recipe and hopefully that can become a definitive recipe, including Apple. I think the benefit for Apple to do that is that yes, they understand the user better, much, much better than any companies out there and they have infinite money, theoretically infinite money, and they have the very closed ecosystem. The way that they’re rolling this out is that they have this SDK called App Intent, right? So different companies or app developers need to choose to enroll or not enroll with that to have the new Siri to control stuff. I guess my relative advantage as a small group, as Rabbit, is that we move fast. We move fast and we keep growing. I think if we put all the cards on our table, we had a spectacular launch. We are the most sold dedicated hardware yet, and we have made good profit, we fix all the day one problems and the company actually quadrupled the size. So we’re growing, we’re moving fast, and now we drop this. Like you said, put a marker between today and yesterday. I think today I can say, a lot of things that you can do on r1, you cannot do it on a iPhone, I believe eventually everyone will be able to come to the same solution that all the devices can do kind of like similar stuff, but I firmly believe at least this remaining half of the year or the Q4 of 2024 and probably till Q1 2025, it is still a game of you have something that they don’t have, versus you guys all have the similar stuff, who’s done better? So I think relatively we have a good six to eight months headstart, we have our little room here, but obviously I also believe when a big company wants to kill a startup, they have a million ways to kill you. That’s just the reality. People keep talking to me and asking questions, “What happens if the risk is too high? What happens if the company dies?” I really don’t think that all these questions matter because we’re on this course, we’re going to see the end, whether it’s a good end or bad end, and I don’t think any answer to these questions will change our course to be honest. I can go here and tell you and be a cry baby like, “This is super hard, this is impossible. Everyone in the industry can kill us easily, or a YouTube reviewer can kill us by posting a review.” It doesn’t change the course because we are doing things, we’re launching, we’re shipping things, we’re moving forward. So it’ll be interesting to see what Apple came from. I was on the Apple iPhone upgrade program, so I automatically get a new iPhone every year by paying the same monthly fee, but I really don’t find any reason to upgrade that because people are talking about Rabbit being launched too early, now you have a company like Apple, if you go to the... What is that called? Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles where it’s close to here or, I guess Mission Street in San Francisco. You go to any major cities, you see these gigantic posters, billboards that Apple put there, right? iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Pro, what are the other lines underneath? It says Apple Intelligence. Is it ready? Is it out? No. Let me talk about growth for a second. You mentioned you quadrupled and I guess you mean by employee size? Yeah. You told Fast Company last month the r1 is only being used daily by 5,000 people. Is that higher or lower than you expected? First of all, you saw that article from I guess Verge? I think — No, it’s Fast Company, that’s what it says. Yeah, no, yeah, but there’s — I’m reading it, I’m looking at it. No, but there’s a Verge [article] says r1 only has 5,000 users daily, which is from- Well that’s a quote from you. First of all, I think that what I said there can be misinterpreted. What I said is that if you go look at the data dump right now, you probably will find 5,000 people using r1. At least 5,000 people. I’m just going to quote you. Fast Company. “Lyu said, ‘Right now around 5,000 people use the r1 daily.’” I said it can be misinterpreted. Okay? Okay. First of all, I think we saw a very steady growth of all the people interacting with r1 and each time with new features, there’s going to be more people using it. I will give you some numbers that I want to throw to you and maybe I can share very detailed usage sometime in the future. First of all, there are about 5 percent of people that have their r1, they’re not happy, that return it, less than 5 percent. Sure. Which is a very good number, and I think the top features that people are using are asking questions and vision and all that, and we really are hoping for people to discover more use cases, but unfortunately we have like four or seven apps on the connections, that’s one of the bottleneck. So if you check for the total query, most of the cases you ask a question, you forget about it, so it’s not about how many times you ask r1, it’s about what kind of task you ask r1 and is r1 actually going to help you? So I guess, yeah, very unfortunate, it seems that that’s a misinterpretation. So what’s the number? What’s the daily active number? We’ll issue the correction tomorrow, what is it? I will go back and get you a very accurate number, but I can tell you yesterday our server actually crashed, so I think — Is it double? Is it 10,000? Is it 25,000? Oh, yesterday our cloud cost actually, I think... Actually, let me check right here, because I can check right here. This is why I love having a founder on the show. Okay, so the past one day is 33,760. Okay. So 33,760, yes. So almost 34K yesterday. Okay. 34,000 active users yesterday. Okay. Yeah, and — What percentage of your sales is that? Yesterday? Yeah, 33,760 people. What percentage of your total sales is that? I think we delivered more than 100,000 units, and that should be around 33 percent, 34 percent. Sure, that makes sense, and that I’m assuming yesterday, because it was a launch of LAM playground, this is a big spike. Yes. What were the days before that? So past two days, 5206, so if you minus 33, that’s another 20,000. Wait, I’m sorry, I don’t think I followed. You said numbers, but I don’t think I followed them. Past two days, say it again. So past two days, 5206, so — That’s the total of two days? Correct. Okay, and one day is with the LAM playground on, so okay, I got what you’re saying. Correct. So you’re saying it’s 5,000 active users at any time, not daily. Correct. Okay. And then you’re getting about 20,000 users daily and then we’ll see if that goes up — Correct. ... because of the LAM playground. Correct. Then there’s an article by The Verge that used that title, 5,000, which is wrong. I can tell you, that’s wrong. That’s very wrong. That’s me saying — Well, you tell Fast Company and then we will update it, but we — Well, he was a — ... ran your quote in the magazine, so we feel good about that. He wasn’t there and he... he or she. That journalist wasn’t there and that’s not what I said in the quote, okay? Welcome back. So you heard all that back and forth about Rabbit’s daily active users, and CEO Jesse Lyu saying he’d get us a better number. I asked the company to clear it up, and what Jesse actually said to Fast Company was that at any given time, Rabbit has 5,000 users. The Fast Company article has been corrected, and we’ll use Jesse’s number of between 20,000 and 34,000 daily active users, which is between – which is still substantially less than the 100,000 units sold. Now that we have the number, we’ll run it, but my question to you is, you’ve got to sell more r1s, you’ve got to get more people who’ve already bought them to continue using it, and you are, in fact, whether or not Apple Intelligence has arrived or not, it will arrive in some fashion in the coming weeks. There’s a report just a week or so ago that Jony Ive is working with Sam Altman and OpenAI on a hardware device. Something will happen with Humane, something will happen with Google, something will happen with Samsung. As that universe of competitors expands, it feels like the core technology you’re betting on is being able to automate a VNC with a large action model, right? You’re going to open up user sessions for people in the cloud and then your LAM is going to go click around on the web for them and that will get you out of the challenges of needing to strike API deals with various companies, with other kinds of deals, copyright deals with various companies, whatever you might need. Is that durable? The idea that this will keep Rabbit away from needing all of the deals that the big companies will just go pay and get? Because that’s the thing that I think about the most. I can think of 10 companies that came up with a technical solution to a legal problem, and even if the technical solution was amazing, the legal problem eventually caught up with them. We’re confident that this technology is the current technology route that it will work, and I haven’t yet seen another approach that actually makes any generic agent system work in any other manner. That doesn’t mean that we’re locked in to one technical path. If you talk to any company, it’s probably not a smart idea to say, “Hey, we just bet on this for the next 10 years.” The technology changes so fast, you have to adapt. But right now, I think we’re off to a good start, we launched a concept with playground with free of charge that you can explore so that we understand how this system can be improved. In fact, I believe the speed can be improved very fast, but we’re not here to say, “Hey, we’re stuck into this.” We do have patents about this, but we’re not saying, “Hey, we think this is the correct path to go.” I don’t think anyone in the AI industry can give you a very definitive answer, be like, “Hey, if you just do this, here’s the structure. This is going to guarantee you the best result in the long run.” I think that’s not a good way to think of it, but yeah, I agree. Everyone in the industry are experimenting with something new and a lot of companies that we saw are going to, like you said, run into some sort of legal problems. There’s music generation platforms, there’s — I mean, this feels like the story of the AI industry broadly, right? There’s a YouTube training video can be used by this or that. There’s all sorts of things like this. But I think it’s not just the builders are adapting, the industry are going to adapt to the builders too. At some point, there’s going to be a conclusion that, “Okay, this is a new policy, these are new terms that we need to follow.” Are you building to that goal? I think, again, this is just the big question I’m thinking about all of these things. Basically every AI product is a technical solution that is ahead of wherever the legal system is or wherever the business deals are. At some point Spotify might show up on your doorstep and say, “You know what? We’re not going to allow agents. It has to be a human user, and we’re going to change our terms of service to say it has to be a human user.” DoorDash might say it, whoever might say it. Are you ready for that outcome? Do you have the budget socked away to go lawyer up and fight that fight? No. At the moment we don’t have the resources to fight that fight, and at the moment, that’s not a real threat to us because they said we’re too small. [Laughs] Fair enough. When do you think the turn hits? I don’t think that it’s a dead end for us, right? No, I’m saying when do you think it’s a turn? When do you think that becomes a conversation about whether you can have agent users or human users? Yeah, that’s exactly what I’m talking about. I don’t think that they are not willing to change their terms. And I think it’s unlikely they’re going to put terms like, it has to be a human. It cannot be. There’s a lot of automation tools out there already. There’s no turning back. I think what they would like to work with any companies, including us, is that when they see a popular demand from this new kind of agent technology, they want to charge for it, and then we ask our user and us to pay for them, and that’s a business deal. That’s more like money terms. That’s what I can see. But as for now, we’re not breaking any of their terms and agreements. And if they change the terms and agreements tomorrow, we’ll take a look and we’ll see how we adapt. But the agent is out there already. There’s a lot of agents running already, so I think there’s no turning back, and it’s very unlikely to say, “Hey, we are going to stop agents using our services.” That’s not going to happen. Think on the longest timeline you can, let’s assume everything works out and it’s all solved. How much time and money is it going to take before the general purpose agent you’re trying to build is a hundred percent reliable and can just do all the things that we all imagine them being able to do? I might have a different opinion here. I think foundation models like OpenAI’s, obviously they’re raising a crazy amount of money. I think we take benefit from what they’ve been working on, because their primary services is selling their models as APIs, which saves a lot of money. We don’t want to recreate the wheel retraining an LLM. I think it might not be as scary as a lot of people might think. I think there’s a huge gap between converting the latest technology into a piece of product versus pushing for a more advanced technology. Obviously I’m very proposed to do high-end research. We want to have a research house here set up at the same scale as OpenAI and DeepMind, even though they’re already far, far behind. But I think what we’re trying to do right now at this current scale, because here’s the money we have. We don’t have $1 billion, we don’t have $2 billion. We have this very limited budget. Is that how can we convert the latest technology and research, and build to a product that we can ship early and collect feedback and learn from it? So a lot of people have different definitions of AGI. I don’t really talk about this term because I think so many people have so many definitions for it. But I do think that AI understands what you say and can help you do things, and maybe here we’re talking about virtually help you click buttons and stuff. There are a lot of companies doing humanoid android that they’re actually giving a hand and legs for the AI to do things. I think it is an entire humanity’s effort, and a lot of the resources can be shared instead of each company has to go raise for this amount of money and take that amount of time to achieve the same goal. So it’s really hard to say, but we know we need more money and resources, that’s for sure. But I think you’ve seen how efficient this team has been performing from seven people, 17 people till today. We raised obviously much less than Humane or any big companies out there. I think it’s actually one of our advantages that we can do things in a relatively cost-efficient way and fast. Timeline wise though — again, assuming everything goes your way, is it a year from now that you can build on all the foundation models and all the other investment in this thing? Just does whatever I ask on the web, is it five years? What do you think? I think the AI model will get very smart very fast, but I think we’re talking about a generational shift. I think obviously we don’t want a 2024 piece of technology operating on eBay’s website, which is basically designed back in 1990, right? So I think a lot of the infra needs to be refreshed, and the biggest gap as I can see here is productionized. So I think in our roadmap we think that it’s very likely that we can get all this separate piece of technology we have like LAM playground, Teach Mode and rabbitOS at some point, maybe next year, merged into a new rabbitOS 2.0. And that actually will push a huge step forward towards this generic goal. But my general take is that the AI model is smart enough, but the action part is a lot of infrastructure. There’s a huge gap between research and productionized, so that’s what we learned. So I will say I’m very optimistic in the three years term, but I think, like I said, right now and starting next year is everyone trying different approaches, and we’ll see which one works, but I think we’re confident on the approach we’re take right now. I just want to end by asking about form factors. Obviously the Rabbit is a very distinctive piece of hardware. People really like the design. We’ve seen just a lot of interesting glasses lately. The idea that we’re all going to work cameras on our face and someone’s going to build the display. Do you think that’s correct? I was wearing the Meta Ray-Bans yesterday. I was like, why would I wear these all the time? I’d rather have a thing. I am not against any form factors. In fact, I really think that there will be a lot of form factors. But when we were trying to design r1, the reason is that we know it’s not going to be a smartphone because we know people are going to do a lot of other things on smartphones, which the current AI cannot do. So we deliberately avoided the smartphone phone factor. Talking about pins with lasers and glasses — I have different comments for each phone factor because there’s no universal rules here. Let’s talk about pins. I think my general pushback for making it a pin with a laser like Humane, I think first of all, I think it’s really cool, but I think it’s too risky. You are trying to offer a new way of utilizing your technology, to have user use the software. That’s already new to them, and you don’t want to just introduce a sci-fi type of gear. So two new things stacked together that’s too risky. So if you look at r1, it’s a very familiar design. You know there’s a button you know you’re going to push, you know the wheel probably can scroll. There’s a screen, you can look at things. So the r1 form factor is very conservative, in the sense that it de-risks the software. It’s just like, people haven’t figured out how to interact in a virtual world, and all of a sudden back in 2016, there’s 200 different companies making goggles and they all failed. So I think I’m very, very conservative on the hardware form factor. Talking about glasses, that’s a different story. I think your skull actually grows to fit the frame, not the other way around. I used to wear prescription frames. I know the pain, your skull is growing to fit the glass frame, not the other way around. So I think there is really no generic fit on the glass frame. I was having fun with my design team joking, I’m like, “Maybe if we do the glass, we’ll probably do the Dragon Ball style,” like the power reader or whatever that is. Like the old Google Glass form factor? I can’t wrap my head around “I have to put a frame that doesn’t fit.” So we’ll see. I think the current smartphone is perfect. I really like the slate of a glass or a screen form factor, but the real problem here is not about the form factor. The problem is about the apps, right? Because now we see all this agent technology, AI stuff, and they’re doing things that apps are doing, and they’re doing things that apps can’t do, so I think the problem is with apps. I forgot to ask you the main question. You’ve had a number of startups, you’ve done a number of things, you have a big idea here. How do you make decisions? What’s your framework for making decisions? I am a very intuitive person. I like to trust my intuition on big directions like what’s going to happen in the long run. But meanwhile, I’m quite conservative in that I hate to predict things. So I think when people replay this episode, they’ll hear probably that I got really tricked by some of your questions. It’s just my brain couldn’t work for predictions. It’s that I don’t like to make predictions — like what happens if this happens, if that happens, what do you think? When I manage my team, I tell people, “We make decisions based on current facts, and we find the best solutions to it.” If you spend too much time — at least, if I spend too much time thinking about what if Apple knocks on your door, what you’re going to do? What if A happens, then B happens, then C happens, what you’re going to do? Most likely you’re going to get a different strategy, right? Because if you think if B is a solution to A — when A happens, you just do B. But there are other types of people they’re like, “Hold on, have you ever thought of when A happens then D happens, then E happens, then F happens, are you still going to do B?” If you think that way, probably not. So I just choose not to predict a lot of what ifs, and I make short, clear, concise decisions based on current facts. And in fact, if you do the recap for what we launched back in the CES, it was probably the best timing. The price is probably just right, the color probably just right, and the decisions of not negotiating, spending six months negotiating with T-Mobile is probably just right. I make current decisions and that’s my style. And I talk to people, everyone talks to me. I told everyone in my team, they can find me anytime. Talk to me anytime. I spend a lot of time talk to my people. We’re, in general, just a very real team, down to earth. I really don’t like some of the other types of startups that spend too much time enjoying the feeling, if you understand what I’m indicating. But there are a lot of people that they say, “Oh, I’m a founder. I’m cool.” No, I’ve grown enough to get rid of that. Probably the same way as if I’m 21, 22, but now I’m 34. Startups are really tough. It’s a war. It’s about survival. It is really, really tough. And it doesn’t really matter if others want to do something. You have to survive, and just surviving by your own is tough in any sense. So that’s why a lot of people ask me — I get asked a lot like, “Okay, what if they do this? What if they do that?” Well, end of the day, there’s nothing you can do. You have to do your thing and they will react to it. I think it’s fair to say that with Rabbit and other startups like us, the biggest companies like Apple, they react to us. They react to us in a very hostile way, a very unusual way that they have this new phone, but all those things are still not there. We’re making very small dent, but that even doesn’t matter. I think for us, we care about our customers. One thing I want to say is that yes, there are a lot of misinformation, there are haters, there are all that feedbacks, criticisms. If you talk to the r1 user, they’re happy. That’s what I care. That’s what I care. Otherwise, there will be a lot of returns, there will be a lot of refunds. We have less than 5 percent return. Put that term in any consumer market electronics device, it’s a good benchmark, and we are going to keep releasing all the stuff. We pushed 17 OTA within five months. The other company pushed like, what? 2, 3, 4, 5 OTAs. So I really hope people can see us — we’re a bunch of underdogs. Our solution isn’t perfect, but it is David versus Goliath on day one because it’s a reality, and don’t expect perfect stuff from us because we are not perfect. We raise very little amount of money and we’re a small team, but we move fast. What we can guarantee is that when Rabbit shows you something, you probably couldn’t even find somewhere else. Just like the hardware, just like the playground or even the very janky day one version of LAM. We are the first company that has Apple Music can be streamed to our device. Yeah. Does Apple, because you’re opening it on the web? Yeah. I mean, I don’t get legal documents to my door. Maybe I will get one, but maybe they think we’re too small, but we do things in our way. I guess, that’s what I want to say. We’re really down to the ground team. That’s my style. Yeah. Jesse, thank you so much for coming to Decoder and being so game to answer these questions. I really appreciate it. Yeah, thank you so much.

October 07, 2024 06:51 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Oct. 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Webscale Network Operators: 2Q24 Market Review" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. This report reviews the growth and development of the webscale network operator (WNO, or webscale) market since 2011. It covers 21 companies. In the most recent 12 months (3Q23-2Q24), webscalers represented $2.47 trillion (T) in revenues (+8.2% YoY), $301 billion (B) in R&D spending (+5.4% YoY), and $226B in capex (+15.4% YoY). They had $612B of cash and short-term investments (-8.5% YoY) on the books as of June 2024, and $527B in total debt (-3.6% YoY). The value of webscalers' net plant, property & equipment (net PP&E) on the books as of June 2024 was $787B, up 19.8% YoY. Webscalers employed approximately 4.182 million (M) people at the end of 2Q24, up a bit from the June 2023 total of 4.085M. Below are key highlights from the report: Revenues: Single quarter revenues in 2Q24 were $614.4 billion (B), up 8.4% YoY. That pushed annualized revenues to $2.466 trillion. Topline growth has been driven by the big 4: Alphabet, Amazon, Meta (FB) and Microsoft. For four straight quarters, all of these companies have recorded double digit revenue growth, well above the rest of the pack. For the 2Q24 annualized period, the fastest growth came from Meta, up 24.3% versus 3Q22-2Q23, followed by Microsoft (+15.7%), Alphabet (13.4%), and Amazon (12.3%). The biggest dollar impact on growth in 2Q24 came from Amazon, as its revenues grew $13.6 billion from 2Q23 to end 2Q24 at $148B, up 10.1% YoY. The biggest curb on growth was Chinese ecommerce player JD.com, which recorded 2Q24 revenues of $40.2B, down $0.8B YoY (-2.0%). Capex: After declining 5% in 2023, webscale capex has been on a tear for the first two quarters of 2024, growing 25% and 51% in 1Q24 and 2Q24 respectively. That pushed 2Q24 annualized capex to $226.4 billion in 2Q24, an all-time high and up 15.4% YoY. Webscalers continue with big land purchases and long-term efforts to develop all-new data center campuses. However, the surge appears to be driven largely by technology spending, in particular purchases of servers (GPU and CPU) for data center facilities already up and running. From 44% of annualized capex in 2Q22, Network/IT and software capex was 54% of total capex for the last two quarters. The biggest capex outlays in 2Q24 came from Amazon ($17.6B), Microsoft ($13.9B), Alphabet ($13.2B), and Meta (FB) ($8.2B). These four account for about 80% of single quarter spending. They are the reason behind the unsustainable surge in the price of NVIDIA stock. Profitability: Webscale free cash flow margins averaged out to 18.6% for the 2Q24 annualized period, much higher than the 16.3% and 14.4% recorded in the annualized 2Q23 and 2Q22 timeframes. Average net profit margins are also strong, totaling 18.8% for the overall market in 2Q24 annualized, from 15.2% in 2Q23 and 16.3% in 2Q22. Meta (FB) and Microsoft have the highest overall margins across these two categories. Amazon is a perpetual drag on margins despite its size. Alibaba and Alphabet both reported FCF figures substantially lower than 2Q23, impacting the market average negatively. Employees: Headcount in the webscale market totaled to 4.18 million in June 2024, slightly up from 4.08 million in June 2023. This difference is negligible, considering the size of some of the webscalers and how quickly the ecommerce specialists in particular can change workforce levels. Headcount has been approximately 4.1 to 4.2 million steadily since late 2021. Some of the biggest webscalers are investing heavily in AI and GenAI, with one clear goal being to improve their internal cost efficiencies. This inevitably will mean fewer employees. Even within the ecommerce space, there is a rising use of robots and autonomous vehicles in the logistics chain. Webscale employment is unlikely to rise much from here, if at all. Regional trends: The Asia-Pacific region has been a drag on the market for several quarters. Webscale revenues in the Americas, Europe, and MEA have been growing in the low double digit range for a few quarters, but AP has been weak: 2Q24 revenue growth was 3% YoY, after a 2% increase in 1Q24. Weak Asian currencies and a very competitive 'big tech' market in China account for the gap. One factor is TikTok's owner, ByteDance: this private company has exploded in the last 3 years, impacting negatively the measured growth of the publicly traded Chinese webscalers that we do track (Alibaba, Baidu, JD, and Tencent). The ByteDance surge also ate into the 2022-23 growth of some western webscalers, notably Meta (FB), but that effect has ebbed.

Good morning. On this day 22 years ago, a company named Palm introduced a mobile device called Zire, a $99 attempt to woo regular people—consumers—into using handheld computers, then called personal digital assistants. Two decades later, handheld computers are ubiquitous, and personal assistants are, shall we say, a bit more AI-flavored than they used to be. But $99? Friend, those days are long gone. —Andrew Nusca Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here. There is not a video game company on earth that hasn’t had a tough time of it in the last two years as the passage of time eroded pandemic gains. But Ubisoft has had it tougher than most. The market value of the French maker of Assassin’s Creed has been steadily declining since it peaked in 2021. At Ubisoft’s height, you needed the equivalent of $20 to purchase a share on the Paris stock exchange; lately, you needed just $2. Ouch. So it comes as no surprise that Tencent and Ubisoft’s founding Guillemot family, which both retain minority stakes in the game publisher, are reportedly exploring taking the company private as it approaches its 39th birthday. (Ubisoft’s CEO is Yves Guillemot.) Its share price jumped more than 30% on the news. A push to go private may shield the company from investors trying to dismantle it, but it won’t rectify its challenges elsewhere. Sales of first-person shooter XDefiant underwhelmed, as did Star Wars Outlaws. Meanwhile, Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been pushed to 2025 and the company’s workers in France are on the cusp of a strike. Remember, Yves: The world is an illusion. One you can either submit to, as most do, or transcend. —AN The company behind Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp has unveiled a new tool that will let people create short video clips by merely entering simple text prompts describing what they want to see and hear. Don’t count on using Meta’s new Movie Gen to become the next Steven Spielberg anytime soon, however—it’s not yet publicly available. And the clips the tool produces are limited to just 16 seconds. In announcing the service, Meta is joining a race that promises to revolutionize filmmaking. Upstarts Runway and Pika already offer similar tools, while OpenAI has developed one that is available only to a small number of users. Critics fear this new wave of AI for video creation risks being misused to spread disinformation. What is clear, though, is that Hollywood stands to both benefit from using AI to create new films and face challenges if anyone in their bedroom can do the same. —Jason Del Rey The Lone Star State has sued TikTok for allegedly misusing the data of its young users, adding to the social media company’s long list of legal woes in the U.S. The lawsuit, filed Thursday, accuses TikTok of violating a new Texas law banning social media companies from selling or sharing a minor’s data without an adult’s approval. The service is also accused of failing to add tools that let parents see how their children use social media; the current version works only if minors consent to being monitored. TikTok denied the allegations, telling the Texas Tribune that it complies with data-sharing laws and that parents can request that their kids’ accounts be deleted. Texas isn’t the only U.S. state to take TikTok to court. Utah, Nebraska, Indiana, and Arkansas have also sued the company, which is based in Los Angeles and Singapore, over alleged privacy and safety violations involving children. Of course, all of this may soon be moot. TikTok, owned by Beijing-headquartered ByteDance, is fighting for its life against the federal government’s order earlier this year that the service be sold or shut down. The clock ticks until mid-January. —Jenn Brice Over the years, major tech companies have come to define the idea of the “open web” to their own benefit—often to the disadvantage of their users. Google is the latest example of such tortured redefinition. New proposed legislation in New Zealand will force the U.S. company to compensate the news publishers that provide a significant portion of the content for its massively profitable search engine (not to mention training data for its generative AI models). Google’s response: Fine, we’ll just stop linking to news articles in our products. The company’s argument for removing the ability for New Zealand’s 5 million residents to access news articles through its popular search engine and other services is that remunerating publishers for using their content is “in conflict with the principles of the open web.” It would also harm small publishers and create unlimited financial exposure for the company, whose parent Alphabet generated $307 billion of revenue in its last full fiscal year. In recent years Australia and Canada have passed laws aimed at forcing Google and rival Meta to pay for news content that appears on their platforms. In Australia, the tech giants entered deals worth many millions; in Canada, they stopped linking to news. How distant a memory is the open web in New Zealand? We’ll soon find out. —Kali Hays Max Schrems strikes again! The Austrian-activist-turned-Meta-arch-nemesis has scored a ruling from the EU’s highest court, saying Meta and other online ad players can’t just use every morsel of someone’s personal data to target ads at them, forever. That’s because the “data minimization” principle in the General Data Protection Regulation says Facebook has to limit how long it can exploit a user’s data and the types of data that can be used for ad targeting. Schrems has been dragging Meta through the EU courts for a dozen years, leaving the wreckage of multiple EU-U.S. data-sharing agreements and forcing the Facebook owner to ask for users’ consent before targeting ads at them. He told me he was “happy to have gotten a clear ruling that Meta and other online advertisers have to minimize the use of personal data for ads.” —David Meyer —Apple Intelligence will arrive Oct. 28. Gird your iPhones. —“Salt Typhoon” cyberattack affects U.S. telcos. It links to the Chinese government. —Can you revamp Facebook for Gen Z? Meta is sure trying. (Sus.) —"Perfctl" malware is going after Linux servers. And has been for three years. Eeek. —Robinhood will debut margin trading in the U.K. Because at 11, it’s marginal, right? © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Squarespace vs GoDaddy: Which is the better website builder?
URL: https://www.techradar.com/pro/website-building/squarespace-vs-godaddy
Time Published: 2024-10-07T09:42:36Z
Full Content:
Feature-packed website builders for those with diverse needs When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Squarespace is a top website builder known for its elegant designs and robust features. With over 100 premium, mobile-optimized templates, it’s a favorite for creatives and businesses seeking visually stunning, professional websites. GoDaddy Website Builder is a popular choice for beginners, offering a user-friendly interface and quick setup. With customizable templates and integrated marketing tools, it’s designed to help small businesses and entrepreneurs create functional websites with ease. Creating a website is easier and more affordable than ever before. From no-code website builders to finding cheap domains and hosting plans, it seems like you can do it all for a couple of bucks. But, among countless brands, two stand out. Both Squarespace and GoDaddy are well known as two of the best website builders on the market, but with many similar tools and features, it is no surprise potential customers often get confused about which one is best for them. Squarespace primarily offers a drag-and-drop website builder, dynamic website templates, and even multiple products targetting specific businesses such as dedicated templates for sellers, Bio Sites, creator tools for freelancers/ influencers, and SEO tools for digital marketers. GoDaddy's primary business is the sale of domains, and not very long ago, it started providing additional services like website building, logo making, and more. But this isn’t to say that GoDaddy isn’t a strong competitor in the website building space. In fact, in a short time, it has become one of the key players with powerful tools that are comparable to the likes of Squarespace. In this guide, we take a look at the most important areas of website building and offer a comparison between what is offered by the two players. The goal isn’t to give a generic answer to ‘which is the best website builder’, but instead provide you with the information you need to make an informed decision on which platform best suits your unique needs and goals. Squarespace pricing is straightforward, starting with the Personal plan. For $16/month (billed annually) you get features like a custom domain, SSL security, unlimited bandwidth, and Squarespace AI. If you need more, the Business plan for $23/month adds advanced website analytics, free invoices, promotional pop-ups, banners, and a nominal 3% transaction fee on sales. For ecommerce, the Basic Commerce plan at $27/month includes customer accounts, product waitlists, and low stock alerts and the Advanced Commerce plan adds advanced shipping, discounts, and abandoned cart recovery for $52/month. You can also save on your Squarespace subscription by signing up for an annual plan over monthly billing and using one of the best Squarespace promo codes at checkout. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! GoDaddy, on the other hand, starts with the Basic plan at $9.99/month, ideal for small businesses that need SSL, unlimited social media platforms alongside unified inbox and website chat. On top of this, the Standard plan adds additional marketing tools like built-in SEO and social posts for $11.99/month. Next up, the Premium plan at $14.99/month includes all the benefits of the Standard plan, plus recurring appointments. Lastly, if you just want to build an online store, the Ecommerce plan at $24.99/month is the best choice as it covers all the essentials like product listings, shipping, and abandoned cart recovery. My Verdict: Squarespace is a premium option with higher pricing, ideal for businesses and creatives needing strong design and e-commerce features. GoDaddy offers more affordable, simple plans, perfect for beginners or businesses looking for a quick and easy website setup. Squarespace’s setup and editing process are both minimalist and visually appealing. With a Fluid Engine drag-and-drop editor, Squarespace offers real-time previews of your edits and even offers many AI features to improve your website. You get dedicated theme patterns, tons of templates distributed on an industry basis, and limited yet versatile font options to fulfill your brand’s persona. If you plan on running an online store, Squarespace has dedicated e-commerce themes and well-organized sections for payments, shopping carts, and products. GoDaddy’s layout may be less visually appealing, but its editor is simpler than Squarespace's, particularly for non-technical users. With a guided walkthrough to set up your site, you can add pictures, design pages, etc., using the swipe-to-style editor both from your desktop or even your phone. Plus, GoDaddy Airo AI creates your website, logo, and more by just using details of your business. Likewise, once your ecommerce store is ready, you can upgrade to start selling and connect with top marketplaces like Instagram, Google, Etsy, eBay, Facebook, and Amazon. My Verdict: Squarespace is perfect if you want a visually-driven, customizable setup, while GoDaddy is better for beginners who value ease of use and speed over advanced design and customization. Squarespace lets you send invoices and sell content like online courses, videos, blogs, memberships as well as physical products. Further, you can use your own domain for checkout and connect with different Point-Of-Sale (POS) systems, helping create a seamless experience for your customers. If you want to go all in with your store, Squarespace provides product reviews for your customers, features for selling your products and services on Facebook and Instagram, limited availability labels, and abandoned cart recovery. On high-tier plans, you get advanced options for shipping, discounts, and access to Commerce APIs. With the GoDaddy Ecommerce plan, you can create dedicated websites to sell products. Just integrate your online store to add products and services, set up payment methods, manage shipping options and return policies, warranties, and guarantees. Plus, you can highlight featured products, integrate Square, PayPal, and Stripe, and keep subscribers informed about sales, coupon offers, and online events along with email marketing tools. GoDaddy also lets you customize your online store with WordPress and WooCommerce integration. My Verdict: Both platforms have extensive ecommerce features and support flat-rate, calculated, and free shipping, along with a range of third-party app integrations. In a nutshell, consider Squarespace if you want a neatly designed and stunning-looking online store and GoDaddy if you’re a beginner on a tight budget who just wants to get started with a simple yet effective ecommerce website. When it comes to SEO, both Squarespace and GoDaddy let you edit tags and meta descriptions, add image alt text, customize URLs, and access keyword support. But there are a few things to consider. Squarespace site comes with a site map using the .xml format, so you don't need to create one manually. Squarespace also lets you add Meta Pixel & Ads for targeted advertising. Plus, you can explore keywords with time filters and access an SEO Checklist making optimizing your site a breeze.. On the other hand, GoDaddy has a step-by-step wizard that guides you through optimizing your homepage, and if you've used it before, you can revisit tasks to refine any page, blog post, or image. Similarly, you can track your site's performance using Google Analytics and return to optimize further as needed. My Verdict: While Squarespace comes with an integrated sitemap and Meta Pixel for users who prefer simplicity, GoDaddy’s SEO wizard provides a more guided, step-by-step approach for beginners. Since both offer quite basic SEO tools, you can try their free trial to see which one suits your business better. Both Squarespace and GoDaddy are solid website builders, but they cater to different needs. GoDaddy is the cheaper and faster option, perfect for those who want to get online quickly without fussing over too many details. It’s great for beginners with its straightforward email marketing process and essential features at an affordable price. GoDaddy’s guided approach is ideal for those who want to get things up and running with minimal hassle. Squarespace, while more expensive, excels in aesthetics and creative control. Its beautiful templates, drag-and-drop editor, and powerful tools like built-in SEO and automatic sitemaps make it a top choice for creatives, artists, and anyone wanting to build a visually stunning online presence. A generous student discount also makes it a great option for young entrepreneurs and creators looking to save while building something professional. In the end, if speed, simplicity, and cost are your main concerns, GoDaddy wins. But if you're after elegance, customization, and appealing aesthetics, Squarespace is a better choice.

However, escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could weigh on investor sentiment this month. Nonetheless, investors could benefit by ignoring short-term noise and tracking the recommendations of top Wall Street analysts to pick stocks with attractive long-term growth potential. Bearing that in mind, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. This week's first pick is CyberArk Software (CYBR), a cybersecurity company that is mainly focused on identity security. The company delivered better-than-expected quarterly results and raised its full-year guidance, indicating solid demand for its products. Recently, RBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg initiated coverage of CYBR stock with a buy rating and a price target of $328, calling it a top mid-cap cybersecurity idea. The analyst thinks that the company is in a "good position to consolidate identity spending and maintain durable and increasingly profitable growth." Hedberg expects CyberArk to sustain strong growth, driven by the demand for identity security and substantial room to grow within its core Privileged Access Management (PAM) market. Additionally, the analyst thinks that the company can grow beyond the PAM market by pursuing cross-sell opportunities in the Access, Secrets, Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) and machine identities markets. Hedberg also expects the company to benefit from its acquisition of Venafi, a machine identity specialist. He anticipates that Venafi's growth will rebound to more than 20% and be accretive to CyberArk's growth and margins over time. Overall, Hedberg is optimistic about a further rise in CyberArk's profitability and expects the company's organic growth to be above 20% for several years, backed by an estimated total addressable market (TAM) of $60 billion. Hedberg ranks No. 164 among more than 9,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 62% of the time, delivering an average return of 14.7%. (See CYBR Hedge Fund Activity on TipRanks) We move to the ride-sharing and food delivery platform Uber Technologies (UBER). After hosting meetings with the company's management, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth reaffirmed a buy rating on UBER stock with a price target of $95. Highlighting the key takeaways from the meetings, Anmuth said that management is confident about achieving a three-year compound annual growth rate of mid- to high-teens for gross bookings, backed by a stable macro and demand backdrop since the second-quarter earnings. In particular, management stated that demand continues to be healthy in both the Mobility and Delivery businesses. Anmuth also noted the company's optimism about expanding its advertising business across Uber Eats and grocery. Notably, the ad business is on a run-rate of $1 billion (as of the second quarter) or about 1% of delivery gross bookings. In fact, delivery profits have improved over the recent quarters due to the high-margin ad business. Uber expects its grocery ad business to account for 5% of gross bookings over time. The analyst also pointed out the company's growing interest in autonomous vehicles (AV). "Uber can add value to AV tech providers by driving higher demand/utilization and building out the AV ecosystem through fleet operations," Anmuth said, based on discussions with management. Anmuth ranks No. 93 among more than 9,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 62% of the time, delivering an average return of 18.4%. (See UBER Stock Buybacks on TipRanks) This week's third stock pick is social media company Meta Platforms (META). At the recently held Meta Connect event, the company highlighted Quest 3S, its latest virtual reality headset, as well as other innovations, including its latest prototype of augmented-reality (AR) smart glasses (Orion) and the new features of its Meta AI chatbot. Following the announcements at the event, Baird analyst Colin Sebastian reaffirmed a buy rating on Meta stock and boosted the price target to $605 from $530. The analyst attributed the higher price target to a number of factors, including significant opportunities to expand core monetization with artificial intelligence (AI)/generative AI features and the ongoing momentum in Messaging. His improved outlook also reflects "generally positive social media ad checks," with September looking better than the trends noted in August. The analyst raised his 2025 revenue and 2024 and 2025 earnings per share estimates to reflect stable macro trends, higher contributions from Messaging and enhancements related to devices and AI-driven platform. However, he slightly lowered his 2025 operating margin estimate to reflect increased networking and depreciation expenses. Commenting on Meta Connect, Sebastian said he thinks that this year's event reflects the significant progress the company has made with its Reality Labs division and AI/generative AI. Specifically, the analyst thinks that the Llama update provides a further edge to Meta's LLMs (large language models) over close rivals like Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI's ChatGPT, and Google's Gemini. He is also optimistic about the innovations related to Meta AI assistant and expects it to be the most popular AI assistant by the end of 2024. Sebastian ranks No. 277 among more than 9,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 57% of the time, delivering an average return of 13.6%.

Title: An $803-billion company most people have never heard of just knocked Tesla out of the Magnificent 7

Time Published: 2024-10-05T08:00:00Z
Full Content:
With hardly anyone noticing, a tech titan you’ve probably never heard of has booted Tesla out of the heavily hyped Magnificent Seven. Can it stay there? The overlooked Magnificent Seventh is Broadcom, a tech company that produces both hardware and software. It’s well-known in the infotech world but unfamiliar beyond it. The Magnificent Seven, conceived as a group of stocks in early 2023, are the most valuable U.S. tech companies by market capitalization. In descending order they include Apple (recent market cap: $3.4 trillion), Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla (recent market cap: $768 billion). Yet Broadcom’s market cap slipped past Tesla’s last spring and has stayed ahead of the EV maker for most of the year. Its market cap is currently around $803 billion. Broadcom is not guaranteed to stay ahead of Tesla, at least in the near term. Tesla’s stock is notoriously volatile, and its market cap could plausibly beat Broadcom’s for a time. But Broadcom’s long-term outlook is by far the sunnier of the two. Wall Street analysts on average expect its stock price to keep climbing, while they expect Tesla’s to continue to fall. Tesla’s stock has retreated to where it was almost four years ago, while Broadcom’s is up 290% since then. So how did this quiet giant sneak into the highest reaches of tech royalty? Mostly by a combination of tech savvy and financial acumen. The company is a grandchild of Hewlett-Packard, which in 1999 spun off a company called Agilent Technologies, which in turn spun off a company called Avago to a pair of private equity firms in 2005. Avago began buying up semiconductor companies, in 2015 buying a big one called Broadcom and taking its name. Broadcom’s PE ancestry has guided it ever since that spinoff. “Broadcom operates pretty much like a PE firm, where it invests in assets that can deliver quick returns,” says Naveen Chhabra, an analyst at the Forrester research and consulting firm. It’s “astute in terms of investing in firms where it can maintain or grow the revenue” and at the same time “can turn the company into a high margin business.” Exhibit A is Broadcom’s biggest acquisition, the cloud-computing firm VMware, which it bought last November. A Forrester report for VMware customers warns them, “Don’t let the price jumps shock you…In most cases, customers will find the renewal quotes multiple times higher than what they paid in the past.” Wall Street approves of Broadcom’s changes. “They appear to be killing it on VMware,” says Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, “which markedly exceeded expectations in the quarter and which seems poised to continue growing.” Shrewd acquisitions and management are central to Broadcom’s growth but don’t fully explain the company’s phenomenally swelling market cap. The other crucial factor is, not surprisingly, the AI frenzy. One of Broadcom’s most important businesses is designing semiconductors—computer chips—and in the past year, demand has been sky-high. Broadcom’s sales of AI chips in fiscal 2023 were $4.2 billion, BofA Securities reports. The company expects AI chip sales will rocket to $12.1 billion this year and $16.9 billion next year. Broadcom’s chip expertise along with VMware’s success has propelled Broadcom’s market cap from just above that of McDonald’s when OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022, to Magnificent Seven levels today. A critical element of Broadcom’s success and its future is CEO Hock Tan, who was recruited to run the company when Avago was spun off in 2005. Now age 72, he was born in Malaysia and earned engineering degrees from MIT plus an MBA from the Harvard Business School. He has spent most of his career in tech companies, though he also held finance jobs at PepsiCo and General Motors—thus the company’s joint expertise in technology and finance. In recent years, Tan has been among the most highly paid U.S. CEOs; he made $162 million last year. Succession is an obvious issue for the company, but no successor is apparent. Tan has said he’ll continue to run the company for at least four more years. Wall Street analysts are mostly cheering for Broadcom. “Numbers look likely to keep going up,” says Bernstein’s Rasgon. “And valuation is looking increasingly attractive.” JPMorgan’s Harlan Sur says the stock “remains our top pick in semiconductors.” No tree grows to the sky, but for now the sun is shining brightly on this company. Beyond that, the only certainty is that Broadcom can’t be anonymous anymore. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.
