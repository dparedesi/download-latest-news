Title: S&P 500 Notches Longest Winning Streak Since 2004 As Stocks Claw Back From ‘Liberation Day’ Crash

Stocks rallied again Friday on a key data point showing strength in the U.S. economy and optimism about trade talks between the U.S. and China, sending the S&P 500 index to its longest winning stretch in two decades, completing the v-shaped recovery from President Donald Trump’s tariffs which briefly crashed U.S. stocks. The S&P rose 1.5% to 5,686 Friday after April’s jobs report revealed better jobs growth than economists forecasted and Beijing indicated it’s open to addressing Trump’s concerns on the country’s role in fentanyl production, opening a potential path to a trade deal with the White House, according to the Wall Street Journal. This was the ninth consecutive positive trading session for the S&P, the longest winning streak for the benchmark since November 2004, according to Barron’s. Following the end-of-week rally, the S&P closed at its highest price since March 28, a week before President Donald Trump announced country-by-country tariff rates in his so-called “Liberation Day” event April 2. The S&P plummeted more than 12% from April 2 to April 8, but stocks have steadily recovered since Trump paused his most hawkish trade policies April 9 and his administration further backed down on tariffs in the following weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and tech-heavy Nasdaq also gained more than 1% Friday and are up big from their tariff-driven April lows, as the Dow is up 10%, or more than 3,600 points, since April 8 and the Nasdaq is up 18% during the time frame. Among the most notable risers Friday were Spotify, Delta Air Lines, Arm Holdings and Palantir, as shares of all four companies gained at least 5%; also jumping were Facebook parent Meta and Microsoft, which both enjoyed more than 2% bumps as a continuation of their rallies following robust earnings reports Tuesday. The S&P is still down 7% from its February record high and 5% since Trump’s second presidency began. The stock market yardstick suffered its worst 100-day start to a presidential term since Richard Nixon’s second term in 1973, according to the Wall Street Journal. “If the labor market holds up and the Trump administration walks back the most egregious tariffs, the economy could skirt a deep recession,” LPL Financial chief economist Jeffrey Roach in emailed comments. About 90% of the 500 companies listed on the S&P have gained during the winning streak stretching back to last Tuesday. The top percentage gainers are all artificial intelligence players: AI-focused government contractor Palantir, AI hardware maker Arista Networks and AI data center power provider Vistra. Among the U.S.’ three dozen “mega-cap” companies valued at $200 billion and above, the biggest winners are Palantir, Elon Musk’s Tesla and Larry Ellison’s cloud computer Oracle. Shares of both Meta and Microsoft have also gained more than 20%. Not taking part in the Friday rally was Apple, as shares of the iPhone maker slid 4%. The big technology firm reported first-quarter earnings Thursday afternoon and nodded to the damaging effects of tariffs to its bottom line, warning of a $900 million direct profit hit from tariffs. A slew of companies have lowered or suspended financial guidance in light of tariff uncertainty. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

May 02, 2025 13:59 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, May 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in AppLovin Corporation ("AppLovin" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: APP) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of AppLovin investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 10, 2023 and March 26, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/applovin-corporation-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=146419&wire=3 APP investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in AppLovin during the relevant time frame, you have until May 5, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate.

Title: Meta Says Its Numbers Show that AI Spending Is Paying Off

Meta (META) plans to boost its spending on AI. That didn't cool enthusiasm for the social media giant's stock. Shares of the Facebook parent surged more than 4% to just over $572 Thursday after the social media giant a day earlier eported better-than-expected quarterly results and pointed to growth in advertising—which accounts for the bulk of Meta's revenue—aided by its investments in AI. The reaction marks a departure from the same time last year, when shares had tumbled after Meta said it planned to spend more on AI, amid worries about whether the spending would be justified. “AI has already made us better at targeting and finding the audiences that will be interested in their products than many businesses are themselves, and that keeps improving,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors during Wednesday’s earnings call. People are spending more time on Meta’s apps as a result of improvements to its recommendation systems, Zuckerberg said, with users now spending 7% more time on Facebook. Instagram saw a 6% jump. Time on Threads—which launched in 2023—jumped 35% as users also grew. Analysts—including those from Citi, JPMorgan, Wedbush, and Jefferies—raised their price targets for the stock Thursday, pointing to Meta's engagement and targeting gains. Analysts from Bank of America bumped their target to $690 from $640, citing Meta's “tangible business results” from AI. Morgan Stanley analysts, who raised their target to $650 from $615 said Meta’s “best in class and still improving ad product and relative [return on investment] are delivering results.” “Even with our significant investments, we don't need to succeed in all of these areas to have a good ROI," Zuckerberg said during Wednesday call. “But if we do, then I think that we will be wildly happy with the investments that we are making.”

Title: The 30s (in the weather and the polls), K.M.’s investment meetings, the high-profile guest from the Emirates, and the BOAK contract signings

– Hello, happy new month and enjoy the break to those of you who are in the middle of a long weekend — it looks like there are quite a few of you. Besides, the weather’s improving a lot starting tomorrow, and next week we’re heading for proper summer heat. I mention it because my source at M.M. jokingly said yesterday: “Let the temperature hit the 30s, so we can hit the 30s in the polls too.” Before I get into current affairs, let me make a quick — and timely — comment triggered by the violent incidents at the Law School, where some thugs attacked professors and students in a lecture hall. I heard Chrysochoidis on TV yesterday say that since 2021 there’s been a law requiring university administrations to control who comes in and out of campuses, but it’s just not being enforced. So now I ask, seriously — who enforces the laws (or doesn’t)? The government, or… my uncle? So basically, what we’ve got is that no one is really pushing rectors to do their jobs (most of them, anyway), and the government still doesn’t seem interested in putting an end to this outrageous, globally unheard-of situation that I’m struggling to find happening anywhere else! K.M – Investors – So, moving on to other current matters, yesterday was quite a productive day for M.M. since K.M. went in the morning to meet with the heads of CVC at a conference held in Athens. This major American fund used to hold its annual gathering in a different country each year, but last year they went nuts over Athens and the Four Seasons in Vouliagmeni — so they came back again this year. Now, I don’t know exactly what was discussed with Mitsotakis, but CVC does have business interests in Greece and continues to be very bullish on investing here. Livanios – Papastergiou – Yesterday, there was a meeting at M.M. ahead of the announcement of the citizen-led evaluation of public services, which kicks off next week. Present at the meeting were Theodoros Livanios and Dimitris Papastergiou, the two ministers responsible for unveiling the evaluation platform next Tuesday. There’s a chance Kyriakos Mitsotakis will attend the press event himself, as he wanted a technical briefing on the system’s readiness. The government sees this evaluation as a major “poll” on how citizens view public services — and clearly as a “magnifying glass” on the problems. Meetings between the Sultan and Government/Business Figures – Today, K.M. will continue his meetings with major foreign investment players as he’s scheduled to meet at M.M. with Al Jaber, the UAE’s Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology — and as you know, the Emirates have large-scale investments in Greece (TERNA Energy, HHG). Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, Chairman of Masdar, CEO of ADNOC Group, and Executive Chairman of XRG — and Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology of the UAE — is expected to meet not only the Prime Minister but also Deputy PM Kostis Hatzidakis. Two months ago, K. Mitsotakis visited Abu Dhabi as part of efforts to deepen the strategic bilateral ties established in 2020, which were followed in 2022 by the Strategic Investment Cooperation Agreement between the Hellenic Development Bank of Investments and ADQ, the UAE’s sovereign fund. Later today, Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber will visit the HQ of TERNA Energy, which is now part of the Masdar Group, accompanied by Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi, CEO of the UAE energy giant. Masdar, which finalized its €3.2 billion acquisition of 100% of TERNA Energy just weeks ago — one of the largest renewables deals in Europe — plans to build a massive 10 GW portfolio across Greece and abroad by 2030. The Arab company will provide funding and international expertise to boost TERNA Energy’s growth and help it meet the target of 6 GW of installed renewable capacity by 2029. Also on the agenda are one-on-one meetings at a central Athens hotel with several ministers and Greek entrepreneurs. Presentation on Juvenile Violence – Next Monday morning, the postponed presentation of the National Strategy for the prevention of violence and juvenile delinquency will take place at M.M. The plan has been put together by Skertsos’ team along with a team of experts led by Professor Vasso Artinopoulou. Right after the presentation, a press conference will be held at the General Secretariat of Information by the relevant ministers to present the new policies and measures of the national strategy, with a horizon extending to 2030. Kostis Staying Put – Elections may still be a ways off, but the creative scenarios have already started flying — about constituencies and such. Some say that Kostis Hatzidakis won’t run in the Northern Sector of Athens B and will instead go on the ND’s national party list. However, I spoke with the Deputy Prime Minister himself, who flat-out denies this and confirms he’s staying in the North, where he was (by far) the top vote-getter in both 2023 and 2019. Leventopaido Aristo, step inside the shop and shut it down – On April 29, the Hellenic Capital Market Commission announced the imposition of fines on four companies for violating paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 9 of decision 1/506/8.4.2009 of the Commission, due to the late submission of their external auditors’ reports on the adequacy and effectiveness of procedures to prevent money laundering. In plain Greek: the companies were fined for missing deadlines and compliance steps to prevent money laundering. One of them — which got the largest fine — was “OPENFUND AEDAKES.” The representative of OPENFUND is Aristidis (Aristos) Doxiadis, a social scientist and economist, Vice President of the National Council for Research and Innovation, and for exactly 32 hours, Deputy Minister of Innovation. For a Harvard graduate — whose motto, by the way, is the Latin word for “truth” — Aristo Doxiadis hasn’t been doing so hot lately. First, he forgot some debts to the state, and now he’s missed the anti-money-laundering deadlines too. Executive Moves – Nikolas Valantasis has joined the investment banking division of Euroxx. The market knows him from his last role as Deputy CEO of the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund, but before the HFSF, Valantasis had a 20-year career both in Greece and abroad with Mckinsey, Citigroup, Eurobank, and Barclays. BOAK Contract Signings – Next week — barring any surprises — the contracts for the Northern Road Axis of Crete (BOAK) project are expected to be signed, specifically for the Chania–Heraklion section. The budget is €2 billion, and with the other two sections included, the total budget reaches €4.5 billion. It’s a construction-concession project with complex requirements, as construction and operation will happen simultaneously. Generally, the most interesting business developments will begin once the contract is signed. Qualco Knocks on the Stock Exchange Door – The increased market volatility didn’t faze Orestis Tsakalotos, and Qualco is preparing to enter the Athens Stock Exchange in the first half of May. The company, which provides tech solutions for the credit sector, has a 25-year history and a presence in 30 countries across Europe and the Middle East. Through its public offering for the main market listing, it aims to raise up to €70 million, mostly to fund acquisitions. The Stock Market Climbs the Wall of Worry – After the three-day sell-off triggered by Trump’s tariffs in early April, it was hard to imagine that the month would end with a positive outcome for the Athens Stock Exchange. The General Index hit its lowest point (1,455 points) on April 7, falling at least 200 points from the March close (1,685 points). However, the comeback came soon after, with some ups and downs, but also several daily “leaps” that brought the General Index back to the 1,700-point range. This marked the sixth consecutive month of growth, a streak not seen since the profitable seven-month period between January and July of 2019. If the market moves contrary to the famous stock market saying “sell in May and go away” and especially against the worsened macroeconomic data from the U.S. economy, the aforementioned rally might be leveled out. In large part, the course of the Athens Stock Exchange will be determined by foreign trends, although May has certain milestones of Greek interest, such as bank results, which – according to market information and estimates – will show stability, as the reduction in euro interest rates was accompanied by an increase in lending – mainly to businesses but also individuals. We also have the Fitch rating on the 16th of the month and the Scope rating on May 30. Nevertheless, most analysts believe that the 1,750-point mark is hard to surpass unless there are significant economic and business events. This is why the last few sessions have been characterized by caution and rushed moves. Yesterday, only the stock exchanges of London and New York were open due to May Day, with relatively low trading volumes. Which Stocks Played Defense – Despite the aftershocks from the contraction of the U.S. GDP, some “heavy hitters” played defense, staying on an upward trajectory and even setting new records. First and foremost, Coca-Cola HBC closed above €45 for the first time ever, propelled by the strong Q1 results. The rise for OPAP and OTE was “quiet,” but enough to push them to 16-year and 3-year highs, respectively. Sarantis hit a 7-year record, trading today without the right to the €0.299 dividend per share. Meanwhile, buyers continued to place bets on the stocks of the two port authorities. Piraeus Port is very close to breaking the €40 mark, while Thessaloniki Port finished Wednesday’s session at its highest point in 17 years. The First by Spyros Theodoropoulos – The president of SEV, Spyros Theodoropoulos, is reintroducing the institution of regular press conferences to “communicate” the views of employers representing a capital of €416 billion and declaring taxable profits of €14 billion. Next Wednesday, SEV will hold its first press conference at its headquarters on Xenofontos Street. Already, the initiative of SEV’s President to unite and activate entrepreneurs in the broader “defense” sector led to the first productive meeting with the Prime Minister and government officials. Tête-à-Tête Between Theodorikakos and Supermarket Owners – The two-month extension of the regime with the cap on profit margins, which the government decided on Wednesday, shows its willingness to end this measure. Minister Theodorikakos promised the Prime Minister a new, more modern framework for price control (a bill is being prepared) and stricter enforcement of anti-profiteering fines. Before making this decision, the Minister of Development met with representatives of the Food Industry, and today, Friday, he will meet with supermarket owners. The cap is coming to an end. But not today. From summer… The Headaches of the German Debt Agency – The German public debt does not exceed 63% of GDP, but the new ambitious defense program of the Merz government will require increased borrowing. The German Debt Agency (Deutsche Finanzagentur DFA) plans to issue 50-year bonds for the first time, and has already announced the issuance of 30-year bonds worth €26 billion for 2025, along with other 20-year and 10-year Bunds. Recently, the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) boldly issued a further 100-year bond to cover its needs, and the markets responded with an interest rate below 2%. The discussion around a 50-year Bund (government bond) – following in the footsteps of France – has already raised yields on euro swaps. The difference between the 50-year and 30-year German SWAP has risen sharply to a new multi-year high. The Discussion on Elon Musk’s Departure from TESLA – Everything started from a report by the Wall Street Journal, which stated that “tensions had increased” at Tesla when the board started looking for a successor to Elon Musk. Tesla officially and categorically denied the rumors about Musk stepping down as CEO. The company’s chairperson, Robyn Denholm, stated that there had been no contact with headhunters for a replacement, despite rumors that the board had considered this possibility due to concerns about the time Musk is dedicating to his governmental duties. Since mid-December 2024, the stock price has fallen by around -48% from the historic high of $488.54, and so far in 2025, it has recorded a decline of around -40%. Today, at $283, Tesla is worth about $908 billion, having quintupled its market value in the last 5 years. Musk denies that he will resign from the ambitious DOGE plan, while some analysts believe a “graceful exit” to the chairmanship of the Board of Directors could be a possibility. Mark Zuckerberg’s Promises to Facebook Shareholders – Microsoft and Meta Platforms announced great results for Q1 2025, but times on Wall Street have changed. Analysts no longer focus on the past but primarily on the future, particularly capital expenditures related to artificial intelligence projects. Microsoft reported capital expenditures of $16.7 billion in Q1. Meta, Mark Zuckerberg’s company, stated it would invest between $64 and $72 billion in capex annually. Interestingly, CEO Mark Zuckerberg began his presentation to analysts with a promise of future returns on all this capital investment in 5 key areas: “Improved advertising, more attractive experiences, business messaging, new Meta AI devices, and more Artificial Intelligence. These are long-term investments to create top-tier AI models and infrastructures. Even with our significant investments, we don’t need to succeed in all these areas to have a good return on investment (ROI).” “The pace of progress across the industry and the opportunities ahead of us are overwhelming.” A Crazy Year for the World’s Largest Stock Exchange – When markets don’t know where they’re heading, when data changes day by day, indexes even at the most “solid” stock exchanges rise and fall like a trampoline. In ¼ of this year’s stock exchange sessions, the S&P 500 in New York has experienced an intra-session change of more than +/- 2%. This phenomenon has occurred at least once a week so far. According to Bloomberg, April appears to be the third most volatile month on record, following October 2008 and March 2020 in the U.S. stock market. In this backdrop of constant volatility, gold appears as a safe harbor. That’s why it continues to make history. Gold prices have outperformed the S&P 500 by 32.6 percentage points since the beginning of the year. This is the largest deviation since 1975, even greater than during the pandemic crisis in 2020. Gold prices have risen by +26.5%, while the S&P 500 index has fallen by -6.1% so far this year. Since the lows of October 2022, gold prices have returned +102%, almost double the gain of +54% from the S&P 500. Explore related questions

Title: Customer First, Agentic AI Next. Amazon Lays Out Its 2025 Road Map

Most earnings announcements and ensuing analyst calls are spent discussing all the money — or lack of it — the host company made during the previous quarter. Not so at Amazon on Thursday (May 1). It spent most of its first-quarter earnings call talking less about the dollars it made and more about how it intends to keep winning the battle for the consumer’s trust. It sounded its traditional theme of the customer experience early and often. So far, anyway, that customer is proving to be fairly resilient. By the numbers, revenue rose 10% from a year earlier to $155.7 billion, with worldwide paid units up 8%, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told analysts. Still, executives struck a cautious note about spending patterns. Deal events such as the Big Spring Sale and Ramadan promotions “helped customers save over $500 million,” CEO Andy Jassy said, adding that price sensitivity is elevated “with this being an uncertain moment for consumers.” Everyday Essentials — groceries, household staples and the like — grew more than twice as fast as the rest of the mix and now make up 1 of every 3 U.S. units sold, a sign that shoppers remain value-focused even as they keep clicking “buy.” For the current quarter, Amazon forecasts net sales of $159 billion to $164 billion and operating income of $13 billion to $17.5 billion, a bounce of between 7% and 11%. The wide range, Olsavsky noted, “reflects the complex external environment,” including tariffs and a seasonal jump in stock-based compensation. Pressed repeatedly on the potential for higher tariffs, Jassy said demand had not yet softened. If anything, he said, Amazon has seen “heightened buying in certain categories that may indicate stocking up in advance of any potential tariff impact.” The company pulled forward inventory in the first quarter, while many marketplace merchants accelerated shipments to U.S. warehouses, a tactic aimed at insulating customers from price spikes. Amazon’s risk, he argued, is muted relative to rivals. Many traditional retailers buy from middlemen who themselves import from China, “so the total tariff will be higher for these retailers than for China-direct sellers” on Amazon’s platform, Jassy said. With more than 2 million global sellers and “hundreds of millions of unique SKUs,” Jassy expects that breadth to cushion any sudden shifts in sourcing or consumer tastes. “When there are uncertain environments, customers tend to choose the provider they trust most,” he said. Behind the scenes, Amazon is pushing through the next wave of efficiency projects that helped power its recent margin rebound. Rearchitecting the inbound freight network to align with the regional fulfillment model “drove productivity in our fulfillment and transportation network,” Olsavsky said, allowing record one-day and same-day delivery volumes while holding down per-package costs. Excluding one-time charges tied to returned merchandise and early tariff buys, first-quarter operating margins would have been 7.2% in North America and 3.7% internationally. Looking ahead, Amazon will “build out same-day delivery sites, expand our rural delivery network, and add robotics and automation,” Olsavsky said, noting that the investments designed to protect profitability even if consumer demand slows. Much of the call’s second half shifted from logistics to artificial intelligence. Jassy called the technology a once-in-a-generation platform shift and said Amazon Web Services already commands a “multibillion-dollar annual revenue run rate” in generative AI services, growing triple-digit percentages despite capacity constraints. To satisfy developers, AWS has layered its Bedrock service with models from Anthropic, Meta, Mistral and Amazon’s in-house Titan family, positioning the cloud division as what Jassy called the “infrastructure for agentic AI.” The most visible proof point is Alexa. A new version, free to Prime members or $19.99 a month for others, is rolling out to more than half a billion installed devices. Unlike earlier voice assistants that merely answered questions, the upgraded Alexa can orchestrate complex routines, Jassy said. “You can say, ‘Open the shades, raise the temperature five degrees and pick dinner music,’ and she just does it. … It really is like having a great personal assistant, which most people in the world don’t have.” Early user feedback, he added, has been “very positive.” Amazon’s playbook for 2025 looks familiar: lean harder into price, speed and selection while pouring capital into technologies — particularly AI — that can widen those same moats. Whether tariffs tighten or the consumer softens, executives argue that the company’s diversified supplier base, sprawling fulfillment network and fast-growing advertising and cloud franchises give it unusual flexibility. As Jassy summed up, “We have emerged from past periods of uncertainty with more relative market segment share than we started — and I’m optimistic this could happen again.” Customer First, Agentic AI Next.

The gross GST Collections for April 2025 have scaled a new high of Rs. 2.37 lakh crores, against the previous high of INR 2.10 lakh crores in April 2024. The growth in GST collections for April is expected since GST on transactions during March, which is the last month of the fiscal year, is payable in April. Due to significant number of year end transactions which take place in March, traditionally, GST collections for April are significantly higher. However, specifically for April 2025, another indicator, which led to anticipation of significantly high GST collections was the 20.2% growth in generation of e-way bills in March 2025, as per data in the monthly economic review for March 2025 released by the Department of Economic Affairs. This is since increase in e-way bills generation is typically correlated with higher economic activity and consequently, higher GST collections.

Regards Viral Shah, IIFL The Bank of Japan (BOJ) kept interest rates steady on Thursday and sharply lowered its growth forecasts, signaling prolonged caution due to the uncertain global trade environment. With concerns over U.S. tariffs and weak exports weighing on sentiment, the BOJ suggested that conditions for future rate hikes may take time to materialize. As a result, the yen weakened to a four-week low, with the dollar climbing 1.7% to 145.45 yen, buoyed by renewed optimism surrounding potential trade agreements between the U.S. and its partners. Meanwhile, in the U.S., manufacturing remained under pressure, contracting for the second consecutive month in April. The ISM Manufacturing PMI fell to 48.7—its lowest in five months—from 49.0 in March. Tariff-related disruptions to supply chains pushed up input costs, forcing some firms to cut jobs, even as overall layoffs announced by employers declined. On the diplomatic front, a Chinese state media outlet reported that the U.S. had reached out to Beijing through multiple channels to resume talks and defuse the ongoing tariff dispute. The outreach hints at a potential thaw in the standoff that has rattled global markets. In China’s property sector, the average resale home price across 100 cities dropped by 0.7% MoM in April, as more inventory entered the market, intensifying competition. YoY, resale home prices plunged 7.2%. In contrast, new home prices rose by 2.5% over the same period, underlining a divergence in market trends. South Korea offered a mixed picture, with exports showing surprising resilience despite external headwinds. Driven by robust semiconductor demand, exports rose 3.7% year-on-year in April to $58.21 billion—the fastest pace in four months. However, signs of strain emerged in the automotive sector, which has started to feel the heat of rising global trade tensions. On the domestic front, Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections hit an all-time high of Rs 2.37 lakh crore, rising 12.6% year-on-year Domestic GST collections grew 10.7% to Rs 1.9 lakh crore, while revenue from imports surged 20.8% to Rs 46,913 crore. Net GST revenue stood at over Rs 2.09 lakh crore, up 9.1% year-on-year, reflecting strong economic momentum and fiscal year-end reconciliations. India’s external sector also reached a milestone, with total exports of goods and services touching a historic high of $825 billion in FY25. This was largely fueled by a record $386.5 billion in services exports. In March alone, services exports jumped 18.6% to \$35.6 billion, defying global trade headwinds. On the inflation front, retail price pressures eased for rural India. Inflation for farm workers dropped to 3.73% in March 2025, down from 4.05% in February. Similarly, inflation for rural workers eased to 3.86%, compared to 4.10% a month earlier, as per official data—offering relief to households in the hinterlands.

Title: Apple’s $95 Billion Sales Quarter Tops Wall Street Estimates as Tech Giant Stays Quiet on Tariffs
URL: https://www.thewrap.com/apple-second-quarter-earnings-2025/
Time Published: 2025-05-01T20:45:49Z
Full Content:
Pro Available to WrapPRO members The world’s most valuable company reports record revenue of nearly $27 billion for its sector that includes Apple TV+ and Apple Music Apple surpassed what Wall Street analysts were looking for on Thursday when it shared its January to March earnings, with the world’s most valuable company reporting more than $95 billion in sales during the quarter. And notably, CEO Tim Cook shared an update on how President Trump’s tariff plan would affect the tech giant during the current quarter, saying it would add $900 million to costs. The strong start to 2025 was bolstered by a record $26.65 billion in revenue for Services, Apple’s wide-ranging sector that includes Apple TV+, Apple Music, and iCloud storage. That big Services quarter helped offset a slight decline in sales from China. Conspicuously, the tech giant did not mention anything about tariffs, China, or President Trump in its press release accompanying its report. Apple has been in the spotlight lately, as investors and analysts have looked to see how the president’s new tariffs will affect the company, which makes most of its products in China. But Cook did address the tariffs on Apple’s earnings call on Thursday afternoon, saying they had a “limited impact” on the company between Jan. and March. That has changed since the president announced his “Liberation Day” tariff plan on Apr. 2, with Cook saying that if nothing changes on the tariff front, “we estimate the impact to add $900 million to our costs.” Cook added it was difficult to “precisely estimate the impact of tariffs, as we are uncertain of potential future actions.” He also said most iPhones sold in the U.S. during the current quarter will come from India, while the “vast majority” of products sold outside the States will still come from China. Apple’s stock price was down 3% to $206.88 per share in after-hours trading. Here are the key results from Apple’s second quarter report: Revenues: $95.36 billion, up 5.10% year-over-year and more than the $94.26 billion that was projected by analysts, according to Zacks Investment Research. Net income: $24.78 billion, up nearly 5% from last year’s $23.63 billion. Earnings Per Share: Apple’s diluted earnings per share of $1.65 were better than analyst estimates of $1.61 EPS. iPhone Sales: Revenue from Apple’s linchpin device increased nearly 2% annually to $46.84 billion. The uptick stands out, considering Apple reported iPhone sales dipped during the final three months of 2024, even as the company reported its best quarterly revenue ever. Services: As noted above, Apple reported $26.65 billion in sales for its Services sector — up 11.64% from the same time last year. This was the second straight quarter Apple set a company sales record for Services, after Apple posted $26.34 billion in Services revenue during the final months of 2024. And as is usually the case, Apple did not mention how much its streaming service, Apple TV+, contributed to revenue; the company also does not share how much Apple Music brought in. Wearables: This was the only sector of Apple’s business that reported a decline in sales. Wearables, which includes Apple Watch and AirPods, reported a 4.94% decline in sales to $7.52 billion. Heading into Thursday, it has been a relatively challenging year for Apple. The company’s stock price is down 12% since the start of the year — a performance mirrored by the other Big Tech companies so far in 2025. Notably, Cook joined Elon Musk, Amazon Founder Jeff Bezos, Alphabet boss Sundar Pichai, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg at President Trump’s inauguration in January. The real action for Apple, though, started in April. Apple was rocked by the president’s tariff plan, with the company seeing its valuation drop by $1 trillion in a matter of days after the tariffs were announced. President Trump’s new tariffs — which now include a 145% tariff on most Chinese imports — has worried Apple analysts and investors since most of the company’s devices are made in China. Apple scrambled to get products into the U.S. before the tariffs went into effect, including flying in 1.5 million iPhones from India. Apple’s stock price has rebounded in recent weeks, recovering most of the $1 trillion that was shaved from its market cap; the company had a $3.20 trillion valuation when markets closed on Thursday. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company announced on Thursday it was increasing its cash dividend 4% to $0.26 per share, and mentioned its board of directors had authorized a $100 billion stock repurchase plan. Cook, in his statement accompanying earnings, took a moment to note the company had reduced its carbon footprint. “Today Apple is reporting strong quarterly results, including double-digit growth in Services,” Cook said. “We were happy to welcome iPhone 16e to our lineup, and to introduce powerful new Macs and iPads that take advantage of the extraordinary capabilities of Apple silicon. And we were proud to announce that we’ve cut our carbon emissions by 60 percent over the past decade.” Apple’s report did not mention anything about its artificial intelligence efforts, although Cook briefly touched on AI in his prepared remarks during the company’s earnings call on Thursday afternoon. Cook said Apple’s AI features, like its writing tools and notification summaries, “help users stay focused and get more done.” He also noted Apple Intelligence, as the company calls it, recently started translating more languages. And one aspect of Apple’s report that stood out: China was the only market where sales declined year-over-year; revenue from China dropped 2.25% to $16.00 billion for the quarter.

Title: Amazon Tops Q1 Earnings Estimates—But Stock Slides On Soft Guidance
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2025/05/01/amazon-tops-q1-earnings-estimates-but-stock-slides-on-soft-guidance/
Time Published: 2025-05-01T20:06:05Z
Full Content:
Amazon delivered results from 2025’s first three months Thursday afternoon—adding to a blockbuster week that included a short-lived standoff between the company and White House—as investors pay keen attention to how the e-commerce giant will comment on how President Trump’s tariffs will impact its business. The White House took significant issue with Amazon’s rumored plans to highlight tariff-related price ... More increases this week. Amazon brought in $155.7 billion in revenue and $1.59 earnings per share ($17.1 billion net income), beating consensus analyst estimates of $155.1 billion in revenue and $1.37 earnings per share ($14.6 billion net income), according to FactSet data. But the Seattle-based firm said it expects the second quarter won’t live up to what Wall Street expected. Amazon guided for $159 billion to $164 billion in Q2 sales ($161.5 billion midpoint) and between $13 billion and $17.5 billion in Q2 operating income ($15.3 billion midpoint), comparing unfavorably to estimates of $161.2 billion in sales and $17.6 billion operating profit for Amazon’s current quarter. Shares of Amazon declined more than 2% in after-hours trading on the weaker-than-expected outlook for the current quarter. Amazon’s artificial intelligence heavy AWS cloud segment booked annual sales growth of 17% to $29.3 billion, roughly in line with forecasts of $29.4 billion. Amazon said "tariff and trade policy" changes were among the complicating factors in issuing guidance, a reference that was not in the previous quarter's outlook. About half of Amazon’s third-party sellers are from China, according to Marketplace Pulse. Many major U.S. companies are warning investors in their earnings reports about the impact tariffs will have. Shares of Amazon climbed 3% on Thursday to $190, closing at their highest level in three weeks. The rally came as the Nasdaq spiked 1.5% following strong earnings reports from Facebook parent Meta and Microsoft. Amazon will hold its earnings call with investors at 5 p.m., livestreamed here. The “biggest focus” for the call will be how Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and management address tariffs, according to Bank of America analyst Justin Post. Amazon and Apple are among the U.S. companies with the heaviest exposure to China tariffs. Both of their stocks have underperformed many of their peers accordingly, as Amazon’s -14% year-to-date return and Apple’s -15% return is worse than the S&P 500’s -5%. Amazon briefly became the target of the Trump administration’s ire Tuesday when White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt deemed the retailer’s reported plans to directly display tariff price increases to consumers a “hostile and political act.” Amazon spokesperson Tim Doyle told Forbes the company only mulled adding those tariff items to its low-price Haul site, but it was “never approved and not going to happen.” Trump called Amazon chairman Jeff Bezos to voice his displeasure with highlighting any tariff price increases. Bezos is a “good guy” and “solved the problem very quickly,” Trump told reporters Tuesday. Bezos is the second-wealthiest person in the world thanks mostly to his 9% stake in Amazon, according to Forbes’ estimates. His $208 billion net worth trails only the $387 billion fortune of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Correction (5/1): Amazon’s Q1 revenue and AWS year-over-year growth were updated. One Community. Many Voices.

The original cryptocurrency was recently changing hands around $96,600, a 2.7% increase over the past 24 hours, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. Altcoins showed bigger gains, with Ethereum and Dogecoin rising 3.5% to $1,850 and 5% to $0.18, respectively. Microsoft and Meta posted quarterly profits on Wednesday surpassing analyst expectations and indicating U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war isn’t weighing on “Magnificent Seven” stocks or the artificial intelligence trade that temporarily turned chipmaker Nvidia into the world’s most valuable firm last year. Nvidia itself saw its stock price jump 2.6% to $112, according to Yahoo Finance. Ahead of Trump’s visit to the U.A.E. scheduled later this month, the U.S. is considering a bilateral chip deal that would ease restrictions on Nvidia sales to the region, per Bloomberg. According to Steven Lubka, head of private clients at Swan Bitcoin, Bitcoin is benefiting from a risk-on sentiment, despite recently rallying on tariff-fueled turmoil alongside gold. The precious metal was set to fall 2.5% on Thursday, according to Yahoo Finance. “The narrative that’s been going around Wall Street for the last few weeks is, ‘heads we win, tails we win,’” he said. “Either the [economic] situation keeps getting worse and Bitcoin rallies with gold [...], or we get out of this whole tariff situation [and] Bitcoin wins in that scenario too.” The U.S. economy contracted at an annualized rate of 0.3% in the first quarter, underscoring recession concerns, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis said on Wednesday. Some analysts think that Bitcoin would benefit if a slowdown forces the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates. For small businesses across America, an economy ailing from Trump’s tariffs would likely cause “irreparable” harm, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce warned in a letter on Thursday. “They need immediate relief from tariffs,” the business organization’s President and CEO, Suzanne P. Clar, wrote. “As each day goes by, small businesses are increasingly endangered by higher costs and interrupted supply chains.” Lubka said that markets were sensitive to Trump’s tariffs at first, but as the economic impact of them becomes increasingly clear, investors are starting to see through them. “The market is realizing that this is just not where we’re going to end up,” he said. “They think they’re not going to stick.” Edited by James Rubin Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

London markets held steady on Thursday, continuing its recovery from April’s turbulence continuing as stocks were climbing in the US. Many markets in Europe, including Euronext Dublin, were closed for the May Day holiday, so the pan-European Stoxx 600 index was flat. LONDON The export-heavy index was little changed by the close after advancing for 13 straight sessions. It clawed back losses from earlier in the day to gain 0.02 per cent, to close at 8,496.8. “We expect tariff talk to ramp up again even if a deal emerges from this 90-day pause,” said Panmure Liberum strategist Susana Cruz. “So the recovery and European growth might remain capped.” She added that the FTSE 100 should continue to outperform, given its focus on income and quality stocks. A mixture of shares in the index were making gains, including housebuilders and financial services firms, while Marks & Spencer was dragging on the index. The UK retailer is continuing to recover from a cyber security attack last week, which has forced it to pause online orders and stop hiring, as it works to resolve problems in its systems. The UK’s blue chip index has been on a winning streak with two straight weeks of gains – its longest run in eight years. It was teetering on the edge of ending this streak with a downturn during the day, but was given a late lift as stock markets opened higher in the US. Rolls-Royce told shareholders it has had a “strong start” to the year and expects to mitigate the impact of US tariffs, and shares rose 1.7 per cent. The engineering giant said it was on track to deliver between £2.7 billion and £2.9 billion of underlying operating profit for 2025. It also said it was closely monitoring the impact of inflation and a wider economic slowdown on demand for its products. Lloyds Banking Group reported a fall in profits for the first quarter of the year, compared with 2024, as it set aside more money for bad debts The banking group disclosed £309 million of impairment charges, up from £57 million a year ago, including £100 million for potential borrower defaults. Shares in the lender were 2.7 per cent lower at close. London-listed Haleon, which has a large plant in Waterford, was up 3.27 per cent in trading to 388.7 pence after adjusted its forecast profits higher than expected due to increased demand. The biggest risers on the index were St James’s Place, Whitbread, Polar Capital Technology Trust, Informa, and EasyJet. The losers of note were Lloyds, AB Foods, London Stock Exchange, Marks & Spencer, and Pearson. The pound was weakening against the US dollar, down 0.5 per cent against the currency at 1.3267. Sterling was up about 0.05 per cent against the euro, at 1.1772. The price of Brent crude oil was up about 0.4 per cent to 61 US dollars per barrel. NEW YORK Wall Street’s main indexes jumped to around one-month highs in early afternoon trading Thursday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq leading gains. Strong quarterly results from heavyweights Microsoft and Meta pointed to a resilient outlook for the technology sector. Microsoft surged to its highest level since late January, driven by an upbeat quarterly growth forecast for its cloud-computing business Azure. The jump helped the stock surpass Apple to became the world’s most valuable company. Meta Platforms made strong gains after posting higher-than-expected revenue on the back of a strong advertising performance. Results from megacaps Amazon and Apple, due after markets close, lead to buoyancy in the companies’ stocks. Other technology megacaps also rose, with Nvidia shares gained which lifted the information technology and communication services sectors to over one-month highs. Among other earnings, Eli Lilly fell following its quarterly results, pressuring the healthcare sector, while McDonald’s dipped slightly after posting a surprise drop in first-quarter global sales. Mobile chip designer Qualcomm fell after it forecast a hit to revenue from the trade war. General Motors gained after offering a new forecast for 2025 core profit. The day’s economic data releases were mixed. The dollar index, which measures it against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro, rose 0.55 per cent to 100.22, with the euro down 0.41 per cent at $1.128. – Additional reporting, Reuters, PA, Bloomberg.

Title: All Investor Eyes On Amazon: Earnings Out Today And Tariffs Are ‘Biggest Focus’

Amazon delivered results from 2025’s first three months Thursday afternoon—adding to a blockbuster week that included a short-lived standoff between the company and White House—as investors pay keen attention to how the e-commerce giant will comment on how President Trump’s tariffs will impact its business. The White House took significant issue with Amazon’s rumored plans to highlight tariff-related price ... More increases this week. Amazon brought in $155.7 billion in revenue and $1.59 earnings per share ($17.1 billion net income), beating consensus analyst estimates of $155.1 billion in revenue and $1.37 earnings per share ($14.6 billion net income), according to FactSet data. But the Seattle-based firm said it expects the second quarter won’t live up to what Wall Street expected. Amazon guided for $159 billion to $164 billion in Q2 sales ($161.5 billion midpoint) and between $13 billion and $17.5 billion in Q2 operating income ($15.3 billion midpoint), comparing unfavorably to estimates of $161.2 billion in sales and $17.6 billion operating profit for Amazon’s current quarter. Shares of Amazon declined more than 2% in after-hours trading on the weaker-than-expected outlook for the current quarter. Amazon’s artificial intelligence heavy AWS cloud segment booked annual sales growth of 17% to $29.3 billion, roughly in line with forecasts of $29.4 billion. Amazon said "tariff and trade policy" changes were among the complicating factors in issuing guidance, a reference that was not in the previous quarter's outlook. About half of Amazon’s third-party sellers are from China, according to Marketplace Pulse. Many major U.S. companies are warning investors in their earnings reports about the impact tariffs will have. Shares of Amazon climbed 3% on Thursday to $190, closing at their highest level in three weeks. The rally came as the Nasdaq spiked 1.5% following strong earnings reports from Facebook parent Meta and Microsoft. Amazon will hold its earnings call with investors at 5 p.m., livestreamed here. The “biggest focus” for the call will be how Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and management address tariffs, according to Bank of America analyst Justin Post. Amazon and Apple are among the U.S. companies with the heaviest exposure to China tariffs. Both of their stocks have underperformed many of their peers accordingly, as Amazon’s -14% year-to-date return and Apple’s -15% return is worse than the S&P 500’s -5%. Amazon briefly became the target of the Trump administration’s ire Tuesday when White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt deemed the retailer’s reported plans to directly display tariff price increases to consumers a “hostile and political act.” Amazon spokesperson Tim Doyle told Forbes the company only mulled adding those tariff items to its low-price Haul site, but it was “never approved and not going to happen.” Trump called Amazon chairman Jeff Bezos to voice his displeasure with highlighting any tariff price increases. Bezos is a “good guy” and “solved the problem very quickly,” Trump told reporters Tuesday. Bezos is the second-wealthiest person in the world thanks mostly to his 9% stake in Amazon, according to Forbes’ estimates. His $208 billion net worth trails only the $387 billion fortune of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Correction (5/1): Amazon’s Q1 revenue and AWS year-over-year growth were updated. One Community. Many Voices.

May 01, 2025 11:33 ET | Source: Berger Montague Berger Montague PHILADELPHIA, May 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Berger Montague PC advises investors that a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) on behalf of purchasers of AppLovin securities between May 10, 2023 through March 26, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investor Deadline: Investors who purchased or acquired AppLovin securities during the Class Period may, no later than MAY 5, 2025, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. To learn your rights, CLICK HERE. Headquartered in Palo Alto, Calif., AppLovin is a developer of a software-based platform for advertisers. According to the complaint, AppLovin and senior management misled investors regarding AppLovin’s financial growth and stability, raising expectations as to the launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and the use of “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games. The truth began to emerge on February 26, 2025, when analysts Fuzzy Panda and Culper Research each published reports accusing AppLovin of, among other things, reverse-engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged that AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, thus presenting false installation numbers and profits. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025 – a decline of $46.06 per share, or 12%. Then, on March 26, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a report alleging numerous issues with the Company, including that AppLovin used proprietary third-party data in a manner that violated the terms of service of Facebook, Google, Snap, Reddit, as well as other platforms, potentially leading to backlash and service blocking and threatening the sustainability of AppLovin’s revenue growth. On this news, the Company’s stock fell $65.92 per share, or 20%, from a close of $327.62 per share on March 26, 2025 to a close of $261.70 per share on March 27, 2025.

Title: McDonald's has a warning about the economy

McDonald’s stock price declined more than 1% on Thursday on disappointing first-quarter results, as broad economic pressures weighed on customers and kept them away. The iconic chain’s U.S. same-store sales dropped 3.6% — a rare miss uncomfortably recalling a similar drop during the 2020 pandemic. Global comparable sales slipped 1%. Total revenue declined 3% to $5.96 billion, while earnings dipped 2% to $2.60 per share. “Consumers today are grappling with uncertainty,” said CEO Chris Kempczinski in the earnings release, calling out macro pressures as guest counts underwhelmed – i.e., as customers skipped their Big Macs and fries. Management was careful to note that the absence of Leap Day distorted year-over-year comparisons, because when you’re the size of McDonald’s, even one fewer sales day per year makes a difference. But the broader story was one of anxious consumers. International results were uneven. Japan and the Middle East helped McDonald’s licensed markets grow 3.5%, but U.K. consumers seemed particularly cautious, dragging down company-operated regions. It wasn’t all bad news, however. One bright spot was McDonald’s digital loyalty program, which drove $8 billion in systemwide sales this quarter and more than $31 billion over the past year — proof that customer engagement remains strong, even as wallets tighten. Those app-based deals for $1.29 any-size fries and 20% off orders over $12 are simply hard to ignore, and become all the more compelling as wallets tighten. McDonald’s joins a growing list of consumer-facing brands flashing warning signs. Harley-Davidson (HOG-4.26%) yanked its full-year guidance Thursday, citing tariff fears. Starbucks (SBUX-6.61%) saw shrinking margins and slowing traffic. Sysco (SYY+0.97%), the largest restaurant supplier in the U.S. and UK, also missed, suggesting a burgeoning restaurant recession cutting across both the higher and lower ends of the markets. Consumer confidence just saw its sharpest drop in years. Meanwhile on Thursday, Wall Street – a part of it, anyway — is roaring. Big Tech earnings from Microsoft (MSFT-0.92%) and Meta (META-2.36%) have powered the Nasdaq higher, with Microsoft up 9% and Meta gaining over 6%. As investors chase AI growth and bet on hyper-scaling, the disconnect between Wall Street and Main Street looks to be growing starker. And for companies relying on middle- and lower-income, discretionary spending, the squeeze is here — and it’s showing up in the numbers. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Microsoft and Meta just revived the stock market's AI trade

The Nasdaq has recovered all of the losses sparked by President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcement on April 2. The Nasdaq 100 plunged as much as 15% since the sky-high tariff announcement, but has since surged as much as 20% as the Trump administration rescinded some of the tariffs and instituted a 90-day pause. Solid earnings results from Microsoft and Meta Platforms helped boost tech stocks even higher on Thursday. During their earnings calls, both companies hyped up AI tech and committed to making massive investments in AI infrastructure. Shares of AI-related stocks boomed Thursday morning, with Nvidia up as much as 5%, and other names including Arista Networks, Vistra, CoreWeave, and Vertiv also surging. The jump in tech shares helped indexes rally after a mixed day on Wednesday, following a slate of weak economic data. Here's where major US indexes stood at about 11:10 a.m. ET: Meta raised capex guidance for 2025 to $64 billion to $72 billion from $60 billion to $65 billion, though higher costs due to tariffs could be playing a role in the increased guidance. The jump in capex plans suggests that the AI infrastructure buildout isn't slowing down as had been feared in recent months following the release of the highly efficient DeepSeek model from a startup in China. "We expect this significant infrastructure footprint we are building will not only help us meet the demands of our business in the near term, but also provide us an advantage in the quality and scale of AI services we can deliver," Meta Platforms CFO Susan Li said on the company's earnings call. Wall Street analysts cheered the results. Bank of America reiterated its "Buy" rating for the stock on Thursday and raised its price target to $690 per share, a potential jump of 16% from Thursday's intraday high. Meanwhile, Microsoft spent the bulk of its earnings call talking about the importance of AI and how it's helping grow its business across the cloud and enterprise software. "Cloud and AI are the essential inputs for every business to expand output, reduce costs, and accelerate growth," Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said. Microsoft's Azure cloud business posted year-over-year revenue growth of 33%, of which about 16% was attributed to AI. "The company is still doubling down on the AI monetization strategy within cloud," Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note after Microsoft's earnings. Microsoft reiterated its guidance to spend $80 billion in capital expenditures this year. Jump to

Good morning. President Donald Trump held a rally this week in Macomb County, Michigan, to mark his first 100 days in office. BI had a reporter in attendance. The key issue for rallygoers they spoke with was, surprisingly, not the economy. Read the full story. In today's newsletter, it's a crucial week for Big Tech. We're breaking down the key details from Meta's and Microsoft's earnings reports — and looking ahead to what Wall Street will be watching for when Apple and Amazon report today. Exciting news: Tech Memo, a weekly BI newsletter from Alistair Barr, is launching soon. Get the scoop on what's happening inside the world's most powerful tech companies — sign up here! What's on deck Markets: Despite the S&P 500's recent rally, Wall Street forecasters see more pain ahead. Tech: Meta, Microsoft, and Google are leading a performance management vibe shift. Business: Why you can expect to see more professionally produced videos on your LinkedIn feed. But first, a moment of truth. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. It's a big week for Big Tech. On Wednesday, Meta and Microsoft reported earnings. Today, it's Apple's and Amazon's turn. The backdrop is grim: a global trade war, the looming threat of stagflation, and falling consumer sentiment. Despite these mounting challenges, this earnings season may hold the keys to a potential stock rally. As of writing, US futures are up following Microsoft's and Meta's reports. Let's kick things off there. The Ms Meta. Another win. Its $42.3 billion in revenue and $6.43 EPS smashed forecasts. Meta shares are up around 6% premarket. CEO Mark Zuckerberg was as bullish as ever on the company's AI plans, with Meta raising its spending estimates for the year. Meanwhile, the company's Reality Labs division lost around $4 billion, again. As BI's Pranav Dixit writes, recent layoffs could signal the beginning of the end for Reality Labs. Up next, Apple and Amazon report earnings after the bell. The As 1. Meet BI's Investor of the Month. David Miller, manager of the Strategy Shares Gold Enhanced Yield ETF, has had a good few months, as investors turn to the safe-haven asset during volatility. His fund has stood out, up 23% this year and 37% over the past 12 months. 2. Investors aren't out of the woods yet. Stocks may have recovered from a historic sell-off in April, but Wall Street pros warn the market could be headed for more pain. They shared three warning signs they see on the horizon. 3. Inside a top stock-picker's investing process. Steve Schurr was central to the equities rebuild at Balyasny, and he was recently poached by Millennium with a $100 million pay package. Here's a look at how he picks investments, according to a presentation recording viewed by BI. 1. Carrots and sticks. No more cushy perks and low accountability: Companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Google are adopting high rewards (carrots) and steep consequences (sticks) for performance management. It reflects an industry shift toward leaner and more intense workplaces. 2. Elon Musk's staying put at Tesla. That's according to the company's chair Robyn Denholm, who denied that the Tesla's board had considered replacing Musk as CEO, in a post on Tesla's X account on Wednesday. 3. Shopify sunsets its revenue share exemption. App developers aren't happy about the policy change and said it would force them to re-evaluate their budgets for 2026. It's bad timing as merchants are already looking to cut costs amid tariffs. 1. CEOs are being grilled on tariff impacts. Here's what CEOs of major companies have said about the trade war's effects on their businesses — and consumers' wallets. Trump's recent rebuke of Amazon means some retailers are likely proceeding with caution, retail experts told BI. 2. Bank of New York Mellon Corp. calls for four days in the office. The memo sent to staff, a copy of which was obtained by BI, said there were "no plans" for employees to return the full five days. It's the latest bank to rein in remote work. 3. LinkedIn wants a bigger slice of the creator economy. The professional networking site said it's planning to launch five new shows from business-oriented creators, including podcast host Steven Bartlett and fashion designer Rebecca Minkoff. Apple, Amazon, McDonald's, Reddit, and Airbnb report earnings. The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York (on parental leave).

Tech stocks roared on Thursday, lifting the Nasdaq 1.2%, with the S&P 500 rising 0.6% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 83 points by market close. Amazon’s after-the-bell earnings release showed a handy beat of analyst estimates as the e-commerce giant posted earnings of $1.59 per share, smashing Street estimates of $1.37. Net sales grew 9% to $155.7 billion and AWS segment sales grew 17% to $29.3 billion. Whether Wall Street loves the results is still up in the air, however, with Amazon stock slipping 2% after hours. Perhaps Microsoft’s cloud and AI-related growth set the bar too high. Earlier on Thursday, Mastercard (MA+0.14%) reported a solid first quarter, with net revenue climbing 14% year-over-year to $7.3 billion, or 17% on a currency-neutral basis, and adjusted earnings per share rising 13% to $3.73. Growth was driven by strong cross-border volume, which climbed 15%, and gross dollar volume and switched transactions, both up 9%. CEO Michael Miebach highlighted strategic partnerships with Microsoft and OpenAI, calling the company’s business model “diversified and resilient” despite macro uncertainty. In addition to Amazon results after the bell, investor were also waiting for results from Apple and Airbnb (ABNB-4.46%). U.S. markets rose Thursday morning, lifted by blockbuster earnings from Microsoft (MSFT-0.92%) and Meta (META-2.36%) that seemed strong enough to overshadow Wednesday’s unexpected GDP contraction. With Big Tech’s collective market cap nearing $10 trillion, investor sentiment looked ready to ride the rally — if Amazon (AMZN-2.87%) and Apple (AAPL-0.39%) can stick the landing after Thursday’s close. Unsurprisingly, the Nasdaq was leading the charge, up 1.8%. The S&P was up under 0.8%, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 0.3%. Delivering their latest quarterlies after Wednesday’s bell, Microsoft and Meta both crushed expectations. Microsoft’s Azure cloud revenue surged 33% year-over-year, driving an 18% jump in earnings per share. Meta posted a staggering 89% profit increase on 27% revenue growth. Microsoft stock was up 9% before the bell Thursday. Shares of Meta added more than 6%. The underlying strength of both reports has markets betting that Amazon, as another “hyperscaler” helping bigwig enterprise customers get in on the AI revolution, will keep the momentum going. Apple, with its different mix of exposure to consumer spending, tariffs, and trade winds, was down about 1.5%. Microsoft’s quarter drew gushing praise from analysts both on and off the earnings call, with Wedbush calling it “an Aaron Judge-like performance” (referring to the New York Yankees slugger). Azure beat both the Street and internal targets, with AI workloads accounting for nearly half the cloud platform’s growth. The company reaffirmed its $80 billion FY25 capital expenditures forecast and said infrastructure investments will continue to rise in FY26 — putting to rest speculation about data center cutbacks. Wedbush raised its price target from $475 to $515. Meta stock jumped after hours as the company reported EPS of $6.43 on revenue of $42.3 billion, beating estimates on both the top and bottom lines. “While many companies have held back guidance amid tariff uncertainty, META did — a bullish sign,” Zacks strategist Andrew Rocco said. The company’s Q2 revenue forecast of $42.5 to $45.5 billion topped Street estimates, and planned 2025 capital expenditures of $64-$72 billion suggest Meta is betting big on sustained AI demand. Even after the Senate narrowly rejected a bipartisan push to block Trump’s new tariffs, trade tensions remain unresolved. U.S. Trade Representative Sarah Bianchi Greer said there are “no official talks yet” with China — though smaller deals with other nations may materialize in the coming weeks. The continuing ambiguity continues to haunt earnings calls and cloud forward guidance, and both Amazon and Apple will likely have to mention the elephant as they report later today. McDonald’s missed earnings expectations as global sales fell, revenue declined, and U.S. same-store sales lagged, with the company pointing to wary consumers and geopolitical headwinds. Harley-Davidson (HOG-4.26%), meanwhile, pulled its full-year guidance altogether after international sales tumbled — citing the growing weight of global trade uncertainty. These warnings reinforce that tariff fears aren’t just weighing on Wall Street — they’re reshaping strategy in C-suites across America. And it’s not just large caps like McDonald’s feeling the strain. The Russell 2000, a barometer of small-cap performance, is down 13.5% so far this year — by far the hardest hit of the four major indexes. It’s a reminder that smaller companies, lacking the pricing power and global leverage of Big Tech, may be the sheer most vulnerable. A Wall Street Journal report suggesting Tesla’s (TSLA-3.33%) board began looking to replace Elon Musk “about a month ago” was later denied by the board. Musk recently announced he’d been spending more time on Tesla, however. Tesla stock closed down slightly. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Forbes Daily: Trump Plays The Blame Game As U.S. GDP Slips

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. Despite reporting a negative first quarter, Etsy is crafting a message that it can stand out amid President Donald Trump’s trade war. The $4.4 billion marketplace for handmade and vintage goods fell far short of Wall Street’s expectations, losing 49 cents per share. But the company is leaning into the fact that over half of the products on its site are sourced from the U.S., and promoting tools that help buyers filter for locally made goods. Meanwhile, rivals like Temu and Shein have already raised prices due to tariffs. “Etsy’s relative value may get better particularly against sites who have a lot of their products sold made in China,” CEO Josh Silverman said on the company’s earnings call. A U.S. flag flies near containers stacked high on a cargo ship at the Port of Los Angeles. U.S. GDP contracted 0.3% in the first quarter, government estimates show, revealing the most comprehensive picture yet of the health of the country’s economy. It’s the weakest economic growth for the U.S. in three years, as the Bureau of Economic Analysis said the negative GDP reading “primarily reflected” an increase in imports, which surged as businesses aimed to get ahead of tariffs, and a decrease in government spending. MORE: President Donald Trump blamed the dip on former President Joe Biden, suggesting any decline in the second quarter could also be the former president’s fault. Trump has also blamed Biden for stock market losses, despite previously taking credit for gains during the last administration. Elon Musk and the chair of Tesla’s board strongly denied a report from the Wall Street Journal that said the carmaker’s board began a search for a new CEO to take over from Musk amid concerns about the company’s plunging stock price. The report claimed that Tesla’s board members had been in touch with recruitment firms to find a successor in an effort to appease “irritated” investors, but board chair Robyn Denholm dismissed the report as “absolutely false.” A crucial measure of inflation slowed in March to its lowest level in years, though it remains above the Fed’s 2% goal. Most economists view tariffs as inflationary, which is expected to complicate the central bank’s efforts to bring price increases down to historically palatable levels. In the midst of a pivotal week for big tech earnings, Microsoft reported its best-ever quarterly revenue and profit totals, while fellow big tech firm Meta also exceeded expectations. Amazon and Apple will report their quarterly results later today, and tariffs remain a looming question mark. “This is a key few days ahead for the markets and tech world,” remarked Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. Who is the richest person in each state? Who is the richest person in your state? Forbes’ latest ranking includes 54 entrepreneurs, investors and heirs worth a record $2 trillion combined, with billionaires in every state but three. Five states have a new wealthiest resident, for instance in Washington, where former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer beats out his old boss Bill Gates after Forbes upped its estimate of the 2021 divorce settlement secured by Gates’ ex-wife Melinda French Gates. Bots are flooding the internet, already making up 50% of all web traffic—a number that’s expected to surge with the adoption of AI. To combat the problem, San Francisco-based Persona is helping companies like OpenAI, LinkedIn and Reddit verify users’ identities, and on Wednesday, the company announced it had raised $200 million, bringing its valuation to $2 billion. As emerging defense companies get a major boost, Accel and New Enterprise Associates are co-leading a $275 million funding round into Chaos Industries, which sells a suite of communications and radar products. The funding, which Forbes reporting revealed values the company at $2 billion, follows a slew of funding rounds announced by Silicon Valley-backed defense tech companies this year. A resolution to reject President Donald Trump’s global tariffs failed in a 49-49 vote in the Senate on Wednesday, after two senators in support of the measure did not attend the vote. A spokesperson for Senator Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who was absent due to illness, reiterated the senator’s stance against the tariffs to Punchbowl News, saying McConnell “believes that tariffs are a tax increase on everybody.” Trump’s trade war with China threatens to make his immigration agenda costlier: Some of the biggest tech suppliers to border and immigration cops are warning about the possibility of increased prices nationwide. An increase in tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada “could have a significant impact on our business,” Axon Enterprise, which provides body cameras, Tasers and cloud-based evidence storage, wrote in an April SEC filing. After months of negotiations, the U.S. and Ukraine have signed an agreement creating the United States–Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund, which will reportedly allow the U.S. some access to Ukraine’s natural resources. The Treasury Department said in a statement the fund is in “recognition of the significant financial and material support that the people of the United States have provided to the defense of Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion” and will help “accelerate Ukraine’s economic recovery.” Pat Neal Florida homebuilder Pat Neal has become a billionaire by catering to the “marvelous middle”: middle- and upper-middle-class families spending between $400,000 and just over $1 million for a new home. “Our strategy is to float above the public homebuilders, to build a home of higher quality,” he says. That means marble surfaces, more landscaping, brick entryways, painted garage floors and cabinets made of solid wood. His company, Neal Communities, has a “perfection committee” that works on issues like making sure oven, microwave and refrigerator doors can open simultaneously without bumping into each other. All this attention to detail and focus on middle- and upper-middle income customers has been a winning strategy: The privately held business is now one of Southwest Florida’s biggest builders, and Forbes estimates that 76-year-old Neal, who owns 100% along with his two sons, has a net worth of $1.2 billion. But this year could test him like no other since the Great Recession. The western part of the Sunshine State, where Neal operates, has its highest housing supply in 15 years at the same time that Covid-era inward migration is dropping off. Home values there could decrease as much as 9% over the coming year, according to the real estate data platform Reventure. Macro trends don’t look favorable either, with high interest rates reducing demand for houses nationwide and the tariff war threatening to add thousands of dollars to the cost of building materials. To prepare, Neal is pivoting to a “barbell-shaped strategy,” going after folks at both the higher and lower ends. “Middle-class people in the last few years have not prospered as they previously did,” Neal says. “I’m moving to the edges for the present, hoping that the marvelous middle recovers over the course of time.” WHY IT MATTERS “Many experts think the housing market is set for one of its worst years in recent memory,” says Forbes reporter Monica Hunter-Hart. “The axe is already coming down hard in Florida, where builder Pat Neal says he’s slashing the prices of his houses by about 10% and simultaneously preparing to face rising costs due to tariffs. He’s implementing a risky plan to survive the economic turmoil; if it works, he’ll emerge stronger than ever.” MORE The Homebuilders Getting Rich Off America’s Housing Shortage A House Committee advanced an educational reform package this week that would overhaul student loans and make Pell Grants less accessible.

Title: Is META Stock Undervalued After A Solid Q1?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CHONGQING, CHINA - APRIL 26: In this photo illustration, the logo of Meta Platforms, Inc. is ... More displayed on a smartphone screen, with the company's infinity loop-style branding visible in the background, on April 26, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) Meta stock (NASDAQ: META) recently announced its Q1 performance, with revenues and earnings significantly surpassing street predictions. It registered sales of $42.3 billion and earnings of $6.43 per share, compared to the consensus forecasts of $41.3 billion and $5.22, respectively. The firm continued to enjoy advantages from a growing user base. Additionally, its outlook for Q2 was more promising than anticipated. META stock, which has seen a 5% decline since the start of the year, has exhibited performance in line with the larger NASDAQ index, which has decreased by 8%. The company’s investments in AI have begun to yield benefits in terms of increased user engagement, suggesting favorable prospects for its stock. However, if you are seeking positive returns with a smoother experience than that of a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P and recorded >91% returns since its inception. Meta Platforms’ revenues of $42.3 billion in Q1 represented a 16% year-over-year increase, driven by a 5% uptick in ad impressions and a 10% rise in average price per ad. Meta also noted a 6% increase in its family daily active people (DAP) to 3.43 billion. The company's primary revenue stream originates from advertising across its family of apps (Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp). The company is utilizing AI to enhance its ad targeting capabilities and is investing in AI-driven content generation. To support its AI strategies, Meta is undertaking considerable infrastructure investments, with anticipated capital expenditures ranging from $64-72 billion for 2025. Not only did the corporation report higher revenues, but its operating margin also expanded to 41%, rising by approximately 300 basis points year-over-year. Increased revenues and margin growth resulted in earnings of $6.43 per share, representing a 37% year-over-year increase. Looking ahead, Meta anticipates its Q2 revenue will be between $42.5 billion and $45.5 billion. At the midpoint of this range, the sales are aligned with the street expectation of $44 billion. Following the company’s impressive Q1 performance, META stock trended higher rising to $572. When examining the stock’s performance over a slightly extended timeframe, the appreciation in META stock over the past four years has been anything but steady, with annual returns being significantly more volatile than those of the S&P 500. The stock returned 23% in 2021, -64% in 2022, 194% in 2023, and 66% in 2024. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, is significantly less volatile. It has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 throughout the last four-year period. What accounts for this?Collectively, the HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; they represent a less erratic investment journey, as illustrated in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the prevailing uncertain macroeconomic climate involving tariffs and trade disputes, can META stock see substantial growth? We estimate Meta Platforms’ valuation at approximately $702 per share, which indicates a 23% upside potential from its current level of around $572. Our projections are based on a 27x price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which surpasses META’s four-year average P/E of 22x. This elevated valuation multiple seems warranted considering the firm’s recent robust advertising growth and enhanced profitability. Nevertheless, there are near-term risks to consider. Ongoing tariff challenges may lead to a reduction in ad spending from China, while Meta’s heavy investment in AI introduces uncertainty regarding whether these costs will ultimately yield substantial returns and significantly enhance the company's future earnings potential. While META stock appears to have significant growth potential, it’s beneficial to examine how Meta’s Peers perform on important metrics.

Title: Economic Digest: Nepal’s Business News in a Snap

01 May 2025 Time taken to read : 12 Minute KATHMANDU: Economic Digest offers a concise yet comprehensive overview of significant business happenings in Nepal, presented in easily digestible summaries. Despite an increase in trading activity, Nepal’s stock market posted a third consecutive decline, with the NEPSE index dropping by 8.14 points to close at 2,623, indicating persistent investor caution. While the trading volume surged to NPR 9.37 billion, gains were limited to a few sectors such as hydropower, microfinance, and trade, while major sectors like banking, finance, and tourism experienced notable losses. This subdued market performance occurs against a backdrop of mixed economic indicators: Nepal’s projected GDP growth of 4.61% and a rise in per capita income to USD 1,517 suggest signs of recovery, especially from non-agricultural sectors. However, persistent structural issues remain—revenue collection has failed to meet targets for three consecutive years, over 29% of industries do not comply with minimum wage laws, and high-profile infrastructure projects like the Gautam Buddha International Airport suffer from weak oversight. Furthermore, policy interventions such as Nepal Rastra Bank’s plan to absorb excess liquidity and regulatory changes to procurement laws reveal ongoing efforts to stabilize the financial system. Altogether, these developments reflect an economy striving for growth amid deep-rooted fiscal and institutional inefficiencies that continue to dampen investor confidence and economic resilience. Nepal stock market drops by 8.14 points despite rise in trading volume The Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) index declined for the third consecutive session on Wednesday, falling by 8.14 points to close at 2,623. The day’s highest point was 2,642. Despite the drop in the index, trading activity saw a notable uptick, with the total transaction volume reaching NPR 9.37 billion—up from NPR 7.57 billion the previous day. Among 314 traded companies, 136 saw declines in share prices, one remained unchanged, and a few posted gains. Most sector indices closed in the red. The banking sector dipped by 0.70%, development banks by 1.06%, finance by 1.24%, and hotel and tourism by 0.50%. Losses were also recorded in life insurance, investment, manufacturing, non-life insurance, and miscellaneous sectors, with declines ranging from 0.07% to 1.16%. In contrast, modest gains were seen in hydropower (0.61%), microfinance (0.04%), and trade (0.40%). Gold and silver prices drop slightly in Nepal The price of hallmark gold in Nepal dropped to NPR 188,100 per tola on Wednesday, down from NPR 188,800 the previous day. Silver prices also declined slightly to NPR 1,965 per tola, compared to NPR 1,970 the previous day, according to the Federation of Nepal Gold and Silver Dealers’ Association. Nepal’s economy projected to grow by 4.61% this fiscal year The National Statistics Office has projected Nepal’s economic growth at 4.61% for the current fiscal year, based on its preliminary national accounts estimates. This follows a revised growth rate of 3.67% for the previous fiscal year, which had initially been recorded at 3.87%. The estimate, calculated at consumer prices, points to a gradual economic rebound. The total size of the economy is expected to hit NPR 6.107 trillion by the end of FY 2081/82, up from NPR 5.704 trillion in the prior fiscal year. NRB to pull NPR 50 billion from financial system to absorb excess liquidity Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) plans to withdraw NPR 50 billion from the banking system on Wednesday as part of its ongoing effort to manage surplus liquidity. The central bank will use its deposit collection tool for a 21-day term to absorb the funds. Banks and financial institutions were invited to submit online bids by 3 PM. NRB has been conducting similar liquidity absorption operations twice weekly—on Sundays and Wednesdays—for the past 18 months due to persistent oversupply of funds in the financial sector. Per capita income in Nepal to reach USD 1,517 this year Nepal’s per capita gross national income (GNI) is projected to rise to USD 1,517 by the end of the current fiscal year, according to new figures from the National Statistics Office. This represents a USD 50 increase from last year’s per capita GNI of USD 1,467, which itself had gone up by USD 57 from the previous year. While the income trend continues upward, the rate of increase has slightly slowed. The GNI figure represents the average income per person, reflecting overall national earnings relative to the population. Revenue collection falls short of targets for three straight years Despite setting ambitious revenue targets, the government has consistently failed to meet them over the past three years. In fiscal year 2078/79, only 77.19% of the target was achieved, and just 74.43% the year before. So far this year, only 61% of the expected revenue has been collected by mid-Baisakh. However, the government continues to raise its targets, with this year’s budget set at NPR 1.86 trillion and next year’s target expected to climb even higher to NPR 1.9 trillion, as per the National Planning Commission. Subcommittee submits weak report on GBIA construction issues A parliamentary subcommittee formed to investigate irregularities in the construction of Gautam Buddha International Airport (GBIA) in Bhairahawa has submitted a report that has been criticized as weak. Led by former tourism minister and CPN-UML lawmaker Yogesh Bhattarai, the subcommittee failed to adequately address financial discipline, spending transparency, or provide a proper breakdown of the NPR 31.82 billion used in the project. Members of the committee included MPs such as Achyut Prasad Mainali, Dr. Amaresh Kumar Singh, and others. Critics, including members of the Audit Committee, expressed concern that the report ignored major issues observed during field inspections. Investment board approves structure and strategy The Investment Board of Nepal has approved its new organizational structure and business strategy during its 61st meeting, chaired by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. The board has also approved the post of a secretary and directed the office to complete a management survey based on the new structure. According to spokesperson Pradyumna Prasad Upadhyaya, the board plans to sign deals for 42 major projects worth USD 17.92 billion (NPR 2.45 trillion) by fiscal year 2085/86. No progress on social media registration despite repeated orders Despite multiple government orders, platforms like Facebook have not registered in Nepal. The government has extended the registration deadline several times, but no progress has been made. Minister for Communications and Information Technology Pradeep Subba Gurung recently gave a one-week deadline, but platforms, including Facebook’s parent company Meta, have not complied. Previously, TikTok had registered after facing a ban, but other platforms remain unregistered. Non-agricultural sector expected to fuel Nepal’s 4.61% GDP growth According to the latest projections by the Central Statistics Office, Nepal’s economy is set to expand by 4.61% this fiscal year, largely driven by gains in non-agricultural sectors. These sectors are forecast to grow by 4.28%. Meanwhile, the agricultural sector is expected to record a 3.28% increase. Rishiram Sigdel, Director of the National Accounts Division, said the projections reflect continued recovery momentum, with industry and services playing a leading role. Over 29% of industries fail to pay minimum wage A new report from GEFONT reveals that more than 29% of industries in Nepal have not implemented the minimum monthly wage of NPR 17,300. The labor audit covered 327 businesses across sectors such as manufacturing, textiles, tourism, education, and healthcare, and found widespread noncompliance with labor laws. SEBON approves IPO for Bikash Hydropower The Securities Board of Nepal (SEBON) has approved Bikash Hydropower Company’s request to issue an IPO. The company will now issue 4.45 million shares worth NPR 445.46 million at a face value of NPR 100 per share. Prabhu Capital will manage the IPO process. Procurement rules amended again to ease deadline extensions for contractors Nepal’s procurement regulations have been amended for the 14th time to allow easier extension of project deadlines. Contractors must now submit valid reasons for project delays, and applications for deadline extensions must be filed within 30 days of the amendment’s publication in the official gazette. Yarsagumba harvesting begins in Manang The collection of Yarsagumba (Cordyceps sinensis), a valuable medicinal herb, has started in Manang district. The harvesting season lasts from mid-Baisakh to the end of Asar. Locals collect the herb with permits issued by the Annapurna Conservation Area Project, following regulations and guidelines for conservation areas, national parks, and buffer zones. Nepal to import 119,000 metric tons of fertilizer for paddy farming To prevent a fertilizer shortage, Nepal is importing an additional 119,000 metric tons of fertilizer, including 94,000 metric tons of urea and 25,000 metric tons of DAP. The fertilizer is expected to arrive by the second week of Jestha, with shipments being handled by Agricultural Inputs Company Limited and Salt Trading Corporation. Gold traders can no longer charge recommendation fees Nepal Rastra Bank has barred gold traders’ associations from charging fees for issuing purchase recommendations. The new rule came after complaints about unfair charges. According to the NRB, all associations must now offer recommendations to traders for free. Hilsa border reopens but Mansarovar pilgrimage still banned Though the Hilsa border point with China reopened last year, the pilgrimage route to Kailash-Mansarovar remains closed. China shut down the route during the COVID-19 pandemic and has not reopened it since. The route had been used by around 15,000 Indian pilgrims annually before the closure. Temporary aerial tours had been launched but were later discontinued due to high costs and limited interest. Wheat output expected to fall in Kailali Wheat production in Kailali district is expected to decline slightly this year. According to the Agricultural Knowledge Center, average yield per hectare is estimated at 3.35 metric tons, down from 3.42 metric tons last year. The estimate is based on surveys in 11 local units, excluding hill areas like Chure and Mohanyal. Helicopter flights banned in Sagarmatha region during peak season Commercial helicopter flights have been banned in the Sagarmatha region during the busy mountaineering season. Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality issued a public notice warning against such operations and package sales, holding the responsible authorities accountable for any violations. Rule removed requiring manpower companies to send 100 workers abroad The mandatory rule requiring manpower companies to send at least 100 workers abroad annually has been scrapped. This provision, part of the Foreign Employment Act, was repealed through a recent bill passed by the House of Representatives. The rule had been in place since 2019 and was heavily opposed by manpower agencies.

Title: Meta Platforms crushes Wall Street’s earnings and revenue targets

UPDATED 20:51 EDT / APRIL 30 2025 by Mike Wheatley Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta Platforms Inc. delighted investors today as it crushed analysts’ targets on earnings and revenue, sending its stock higher in extended trading. The company reported first-quarter earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of $6.43 per share, well ahead of the $5.28 per share consensus estimate. Revenue for the period came to $42.31 billion, up 16% from a year earlier and easily beating the Street’s target of $41.4 billion. All told, Meta delivered a net profit of $16.64 billion in the quarter, rising from $12.37 billion one year ago. On a conference call, Meta Chief Financial Officer Susan Li told analysts that the company is looking for second-quarter revenue of between $42.5 billion and $44.5 billion, the midpoint of that range matching the Street’s target of $44.03 billion. She delivered the optimistic guidance while admitting the company has been hit by reduced ad spending from e-commerce exporters based in Asia. Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg (pictured) said on the call that the business is performing well. “I think we’re positioned to navigate the macroeconomic uncertainty,” he said, referring to the trade disruption that’s anticipated to arise from U.S. President Donald Trump’s recently imposed tariffs. The company said it’s reducing its forecast for total expenses to a range of between $113 billion and $118 billion, down from $114 billion to $119 billion. However, it also raised its forecast for capital expenditures to a range of $64 billion to $72 billion, up from its previous guidance of $60 billion to $65 billion. The increased capital expenditure will be directed at “additional data center investments” that aim to support the company’s ongoing efforts in artificial intelligence, it said. It also takes into account the expected increase in hardware costs, with data center servers and storage arrays likely to be impacted by the tariffs. “There’s just a lot of uncertainty around this, given the ongoing trade discussions,” Li said. She added that the company is working to mitigate some of this uncertainty by “optimizing” its supply chain as much as possible. Li also talked about a recent ruling by the European Commission, which decided that Meta’s no-ads subscription service is not compliant with its regulations. She said the ruling could lead to a “marginally worse user experience” for users based in Europe. More importantly, it could have a “significant impact” on its European revenue, which will likely be felt as soon as the third quarter. But she reassured investors that the company is trying to resolve this issue. “We are continuing to engage actively with the European Commission further on this, so we hope to have more clarity by next quarter’s call,” she promised. Meta said it delivered $41.39 billion in advertising revenue during the past quarter, beating the Street’s forecast of $40.44 billion. Moreover, it saw its number of daily active users rise to 3.43 billion across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, rising from 3.35 billion one year earlier and surpassing the analyst target of 3.39 billion. CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino told SiliconANGLE he was impressed by the resilience of Meta’s advertising business, which benefited from ad impression growth of 5% and an average price-per-ad increase of 10% during the quarter. “Meta’s execution on operating margin was also a notable positive, expanding to 41% from 38%, but we expect greater investments in AI to compress these margins later this year,” he added. “But daily active user growth remains healthy at more than 6%.” Zuckerberg said the company’s new Threads microblogging service, which is a rival to Elon Musk’s X platform, now has more than 350 million monthly active users, up from 320 million in January. He added that the company is now looking to push more ads on Threads, but Li tempered expectations by saying it’s unlikely to drive meaningful revenue growth this year. Elsewhere, the Meta AI digital assistant has grown to almost 1 billion monthly active users, up from 700 million in January. The vast majority of those users access the service through WhatsApp, Zuckerberg said. It’s also accessible through the Messenger app and Instagram, and this week the company announced it’s getting a standalone application of its own. According to Zuckerberg, the company is trying to work out how to best integrate ads with Meta AI, and also considering charging for a premium version of the digital assistant. However, it remains focused primarily on building out the product before it starts to monetize it, he said. Meta’s Reality Labs division, which is focused on building metaverse-related technologies, continues to be a money pit. The unit posted an operating loss of $4.2 billion in the quarter, lower than the $4.6 billion forecast from analysts. Its total sales came to $412 million, down 6% from a year earlier and lower than the analyst target of $492.7 million. Last week, Meta revealed it was cutting more than 100 jobs from the Reality Labs unit. Constellation Research Inc. analyst Holger Mueller said Meta is on a roll, growing nicely and investing in its future with one in four of its revenue dollars going towards its capital expenditures. “The big prize for Meta is AI, as the combination of reality and advertising represents the ultimate connection of consumers to its business,” he said. “In the meantime, investors will be watching to see how Meta handles the inevitable headwinds coming its way.” Li also talked about the company’s ad revenues stemming from the Asia-Pacific region, which came in at $8.22 billion, below the $8.42 billion analyst forecast. She explained that the company had seen reduced spend in the U.S. from Asian e-commerce retailers, saying that this is likely thanks to the imminent end of the “de minimis” loophole, which allows for tax-free imports of goods worth less than $1,000 to the U.S. Although a portion of that spend has been redirected to other markets, those advertisers have reduced their spending “below the levels prior to April,” Li said. Meta isn’t the only ad giant bracing itself for possible headwinds relating to the tariffs and other economic uncertainties. On Tuesday, Snap Inc. withheld its outlook as a result of the uncertain conditions, while Google parent Alphabet Inc. warned last week that it expects its advertising business to take a hit. Another major advertiser, Amazon.com Inc., will report its earnings on Thursday. Despite the ad uncertainty, investors were pleased enough with Meta’s results, and its stock gained more than 5% in extended trading. However, Meta’s shares are still down just over 6% in the year to date.
