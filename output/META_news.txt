Dave Smith is a writer and editor who previously has been published in Business Insider, Newsweek, ABC News, and USA TODAY. Major technology stocks tied to artificial intelligence took a sharp downward turn Tuesday, rattling markets and raising concerns the sector’s billion-dollar promises may not be bearing fruit as quickly as hoped. Shares of Palantir Technologies, the data-analytics firm widely viewed as an AI bellwether, plunged more than 9%, its worst tumble since March, after prominent short-seller Andrew Left of Citron Research renewed his bearish stance. Other major names felt similar shocks, highlighting underlying investor doubts: Oracle, in the midst of aggressive AI investments and a strategic pivot that included mass layoffs in its cloud division, saw its shares drop nearly 6%. Chipmakers integral to the AI boom struggled as well: Advanced Micro Devices fell 5.4%, Arm Holdings lost 5%, and Nvidia, the sector’s dominant force, slid 3.5%. SoftBank, whose outsize bets on AI have defined its recent strategy, dropped more than 7%—amplifying concerns about a broader tech correction and underscoring Wall Street’s uneasy relationship with the so-called next big thing. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman even admitted AI is in a bubble. The abrupt selloff echoes broader skepticism about the sustainability of sky-high valuations seen in AI-focused companies. But experts say that while investors are right to be cautious, the underlying technology isn’t going away—and this is a short-term drop during a long-term transformation. Behind the market jitters, a recent report from MIT said approximately 95% of company generative AI pilot programs resulted in “little to no measurable impact” on revenue or profits. While a handful of startups have thrived, the vast majority of corporate efforts have stalled, caught in flawed enterprise integrations and learning gaps. The research, encompassing 150 executive interviews, 350 employee surveys, and an analysis of 300 public AI deployments, paints a sobering picture: Outside exceptional cases, generative AI projects have yet to justify the vast spending across the sector. MIT’s lead author, Aditya Challapally, told Fortune failure may lie less in the underlying tools than in enterprise execution, citing issues around workflow adaptation and resource allocation. In contrast, nimble startups have rapidly scaled revenues—validating the potential of the technology when well integrated, but also highlighting a gulf between hype and reality for larger companies. “There’s no doubt that when MIT reports a 95% failure rate in AI pilot programs, it’s alarming,” Mike Sinoway, CEO of AI-powered search software company Lucidworks, told Fortune. “But the problem has less to do with the underlying technology and more with how companies are approaching it. “In our own research, polling over 1,600 AI practitioners and leaders and validating this with bot analysis, we found 65% of teams are rolling out AI without the fundamental tech infrastructure in place,” he said. “Trying to build cutting-edge applications atop weak foundations is like building an F1 car on a go-kart engine—you simply won’t get results. So while a 95% failure rate might seem like a sign of a bubble, once organizations focus more on what AI actually needs to succeed, we’ll begin to see the traction everyone is expecting.” Chase Feiger, CEO of Ostro, an AI-powered platform for life sciences brands, agreed current volatility is part of a typical tech cycle. “Talk of an AI bubble isn’t new,” Feiger told Fortune. “Every major tech shift goes through a stage where hype runs ahead of business fundamentals,” he said. “Some companies are burning money on inference costs, offering ‘all-you-can-eat’ models that cost thousands to run but bring in only hundreds in revenue—a pattern reminiscent of Uber’s early years. That overinflation explains market caution, but the underlying technology isn’t overhyped. In health care, for example, AI is transforming drug development, patient care, and physician decision-making. “The correction will come. But over the long haul, the winners will be those who prove AI delivers durable value in complex, high-stakes environments,” Feiger added. Harvard professor Christina Inge told Fortune the duality at work is nothing new. “Investors are right to be cautious,” she said. “Not every company claiming to be ‘AI-driven’ is creating real value; a lot of it is smoke and mirrors, with some tools amounting to incremental improvements on non-AI tech. Correction is inevitable, as history shows. “But the technology isn’t going away. AI is already making a difference in health care, marketing, logistics, and finance. And we’re only scratching the surface. In the long run, I expect the impact of AI to rival the Industrial Revolution. There’s a lot of froth in the market right now, but the bigger story is just beginning. In other words: short-term bubble, long-term transformation.” That view is echoed by Shay Boloor, chief market strategist at Futurum Equities. “What we’re seeing isn’t a bubble, but the foundation of a new economy,” Boloor told Fortune. “There will be volatility—inevitable with a sector this hot—but the fundamental reality is every industry will be transformed by AI. Just look at Microsoft and Meta this quarter: Azure hit its biggest revenue numbers ever, Microsoft Cloud crossed $46 billion, and Meta monetized not just attention but intelligence, with 22% revenue growth and 38% profit growth, while spending $70 billion in capex. The demand is not hypothetical—it’s scaling now. “We’re not at the peak of AI. We’re at an inflection point.” Siamak Freydoonnejad, cofounder of Sprites AI, which makes an AI-powered marketing agent, says, however, deciding whether or not we’re in an AI bubble “misses the point” entirely. “Stock prices may have outpaced fundamentals, but inside enterprises, AI is already infrastructure,” Freydoonnejad told Fortune. “No one who’s seen campaign launch speed improve by 70% is going back to the old way,” he said. “Some vendors did slap ‘AI’ on legacy products to cash in, but those valuations will be corrected—and deservedly so. What matters is which firms are using AI not as a shallow trend but as the basis for their entire product. Real efficiency gains are showing up for companies embedding AI deeply in their workflows. The market is about to sort out those with substantive results from those selling only promises.” Omar Kouhlani, CEO of Runmic, which uses AI to design revenue strategies for sales teams, told Fortune infrastructure spending reveals the true momentum. “Big Tech just raised AI spending guidance to $360 billion–plus for 2025, up sharply from previous estimates. I watch those numbers more closely than day-to-day share price changes,” he said. “This isn’t a rejection of AI, it’s a market becoming more selective,” Kouhlani continued. “The crash is separating real AI revenues from companies that only have AI PowerPoints. We’re not in another dotcom bust. The infrastructure is being built now, and expectations are adjusting faster than the technology itself.” Usha Haley, the W. Frank Barton Distinguished Chair in International Business and professor of management at the Barton School of Business at Wichita State University, argues that cycles of bubbles and corrections are intrinsic to tech revolutions. “Historically, every breakthrough technology comes with bubbles,” Haley told Fortune. “AI is already delivering productivity gains, even as it erodes some jobs. We’ll see some correction and consolidation, but not a collapse. The strongest players will emerge into a changed landscape. Regulation and stochastic shocks could alter outcomes, but competitive environments—not monopolies—will point to future leaders.” Fabian Stephany, a lecturer at the University of Oxford, sees evidence for both sides: “To some extent, yes, there is an AI bubble. But long-term fundamentals are exceptionally strong,” he told Fortune. “Many firms use AI for marketing more than substance, which has inflated valuations. Yet stock-market gains this year are overwhelmingly linked to real advances in AI at companies like Nvidia, Meta, Microsoft, and Broadcom. Nvidia alone accounts for 26% of the S&P’s advance, underscoring real market transformation.” David Brudenell, executive director at Decidr, which builds an AI-powered operating system for businesses to automate workflows, told Fortune that “correction is necessary” as it “separates speculation from structural value.” And David Russell, global head of market strategy at TradeStation, agreed: “Pullbacks are normal after rallies stall. “Major players like Palantir and Microsoft failed to hold breakouts after strong earnings. That’s a sign the good news may be priced in,” Russell told Fortune. “Markets move ahead of fundamentals, but excessive prices punish those chasing the froth. In the weeks ahead, sentiment could shift to other macro factors.” The expert consensus is clear: While stocks have pulled back, the fundamentals behind AI remain strong. Most believe the recent rout is an overdue market sorting—separating hype from reality, speculation from enduring value. Even MIT’s cautious findings are seen as a spur rather than a death knell. Now, all eyes will turn to Nvidia, which reports quarterly earnings next week. But broadly speaking, what the market is experiencing isn’t a sign of crisis, but a marker of growing pains.

Title: The big buydown bet
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/bitoday-newsletters-housing-trick-low-rate-high-value-lender-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-20T15:11:57Z

Good morning. If you bought the Great Value raw frozen shrimp at Walmart, throw it away. The FDA says a possible contamination from Cesium-137, a radioactive isotope, has been detected. Don't sell it, don't serve it, and definitely don't eat it — no matter how much BI's Katie Notopoulos may want to. In today's big story, homebuyers made a big bet on lower mortgage rates. They're paying a high price. What's on deck: Markets: Bank of America thinks these 10 cheap stocks are poised for big gains. Tech: This party is the surest sign yet that the tech dating scene is a mess. Business: In its latest hardcore turn, AT&T is hitting some managers with an ultimatum. But first, betting the house. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. For homebuilders, it represented a silver bullet. For buyers, it can be a mousetrap. Rick Palacios Jr., the director of research at John Burns Research and Consulting, has been sounding the alarm since last summer about a dangerous gamble tempting Americans: "mortgage rate buydowns." They seemed to offer an elegant solution. With mortgage rates sky-high, your dream home might feel out of reach. That's not good for you, nor for the homebuilders stuck with inventory. But what if a homebuilder shaved a percentage point off your monthly payments, even just for the first couple of years? Surely, rates must drop soon. When the deal runs out, you could refinance. Easy. The cost to builders is the upfront cash to lower the rate via their in-house lenders. Matt Hutton, a millennial homebuyer, told BI his builder threw in $30,000 in incentives — including the buydown — to close the deal. You buy your house. They sell theirs. Crucially, the official listing price doesn't change, so home values remain inflated. That was the wager a few years ago. Today, rates are typically still above 6.5% — right where buyers had hoped not to end up. Their gamble has failed spectacularly, BI's James Rodriguez writes. There's an even more dire scenario, Palacios warns. What if you need to sell? Life happens — a new job, a marriage, a divorce — and you may have to move. But today's sellers face a weak market. In many parts of the US, more homes are sitting unsold than at any point since the pandemic. Buyers a few years ago may have accepted inflated prices in exchange for monthly savings — but they can't usually pass those savings along to the next buyer. To close a deal, they may have to take a loss. Just ask Hutton. After five years, he and his wife sold their first home for a $150,000 profit and upgraded to a bigger, brand-new home for nearly $800,000. A few months later, they wanted out. They ended up selling it for roughly what they paid for it, after dropping their asking price by $50,000. In addition, the buyer asked them to cover a $40,000 buydown to match the builder's ongoing incentives for nearby homes. They agreed. Today, Hutton and his wife are back in an apartment, waiting for another shot at the dream. 1. Wage growth isn't keeping up with prices. However, some industries have enjoyed more growth than others. Business services and financial activities have less purchasing power than they did in 2021, while hospitality and healthcare workers have more. 2. Bank of America shares 10 ultra-cheap stocks primed to rebound. The bank thinks the days of large-cap stock dominance are numbered. If the US enters a recovery phase alongside rate cuts, beaten-down stocks could surge. 3. A short-seller explains why he thinks Palantir is overvalued. In a new note, Andrew Left's firm Citron Research used OpenAI's $500 billion valuation as a benchmark to measure the defense tech giant against. Even if Palantir fell to $40 a share, it'd still be expensive, the firm said. 1. Inside San Francisco's "enforced ratio" party in a Tesla showroom. Fed up with male-dominated spaces in SF, two women who work in the tech industry threw a bash centered around "feminine energy." It offered a rare chance to dress up and a strictly enforced 50/50 gender ratio — which, of course, left hundreds of men on the waitlist. 2. Another W for Tim Cook. The Apple CEO notched a win in his fight with the UK government, which had ordered the company to make encrypted user data accessible to it. Apple enjoyed the backing of the US government, which said that the UK had agreed to drop the order. 3. Do you miss the old internet? There's an app for that. Perfectly Imperfect is a newsletter and social network that's designed to feel like the old version of the internet, reminiscent of Tumblr and MySpace. Its founder told BI it's betting on events and community-focused tools to grow. 1. AT&T tells some managers: Relocate or get laid off. The telecom company is consolidating 22 internal help-desk centers into six US locations. Affected managers get two weeks to decide whether to move or lose their jobs and get severance, BI's Tim Paradis and Dominick Reuter exclusively report. 2. Spike Lee's Colin Kaepernick doc is officially game over. The acclaimed director has no plans to shop around his scrapped ESPN docuseries about the retired football player to other platforms. "That thing fell apart a year ago," Lee said in an interview with BI's Jason Guerrasio. "I've moved on." 3. We still don't know if Trump is getting free ads from Paramount. Trump says Larry and David Ellison promised him millions in free ads, but Paramount CEO David Ellison doesn't want to comment on it. We shouldn't be left guessing about what's true, writes BI's Peter Kafka. Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London. Meghan Morris, bureau chief, in Singapore.

Title: AI Industry Trembles as Nvidia's Stock Nosedives
URL: https://futurism.com/ai-industry-nvidia-stock
Time Published: 2025-08-20T14:39:27Z
Full Content:
Shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia plunged on Wednesday, dropping by more than three percent in early trading — for a total slide of over five percent in the past week. Other major AI players fell as well, including Google, Meta, and Tesla. AI software company Palantir's stock fell by nearly nine percent this morning. Nvidia is particularly interesting, though, because while those other companies mainly produce software, Nvidia has been making bank by selling the hardware powering the AI industry's explosive ascent. If the AI industry is a gold rush, then Nvidia is selling shovels — and when the shovel seller starts to struggle, everybody gets nervous. Analysts were left perplexed by the selloff, casting around for specific causes. Could muted enthusiasm and AI data center Coreweave's 38 percent collapse post Q2 earnings be coming after the AI industry's top performers? Nvidia's shares fell after Reuters reported that the firm was working on a new generation AI chip for the Chinese market, which could potentially outperform its H20 workhorse. There are also certain signs of internal shakiness, with CEO Jensen Huang recently 150,000 shares for tens of millions of dollars last week. However, the sale was planned in March, and was triggered by hitting predetermined parameters, such as price and volume. In other words, it's not entirely clear what's causing the selloff. Nvidia and its ilk are still up considerably if you zoom out; both Nvidia and Palantir hit all-time highs earlier this month. Palantir alone rose more than 150 percent since April. Could the latest selloff be a market correction, a reality check in light of some sky-high valuations? There has been considerable talk of the AI industry showing signs of a dot com era-style bubble. Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman himself acknowledged last week that we're in a "phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI." How long Nvidia's drop in share price will last remains to be seen. The company's meteoric rise has repeatedly been met by bullish investors buying the dip, sending it to all-time highs. Nvidia will be reporting its second-quarter earnings a week from now. Investors expect strong Q2 results, and given enormous sales and continued optimism surrounding AI, it's not a stretch to assume they'll be satisfied. If anything, investors are as optimistic as ever, suggesting that the AI industry's gravy train isn't likely to stop any time soon. "NVDA is now the most under-owned large-cap tech stock," Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in a note this week, as quoted by Yahoo Finance.

August 20, 2025 07:13 ET | Source: YieldMax YieldMax CHICAGO, MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, Aug. 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax® today announced distributions for the YieldMax® Weekly Payers and Group C ETFs listed in the table below. Standardized Performance and Fund details can be obtained by clicking the ETF Ticker in the table above or by visiting us at www.yieldmaxetfs.com Performance data quoted represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost and current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted above. Performance current to the most recent month-end can be obtained by calling (866) 864 3968. Note: DIPS, FIAT, CRSH, YQQQ and WNTR are hereinafter referred to as the “Short ETFs.” Distributions are not guaranteed. The Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield are not indicative of future distributions, if any, on the ETFs. In particular, future distributions on any ETF may differ significantly from its Distribution Rate or 30-Day SEC Yield. You are not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from period to period and may be zero. Accordingly, the Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield will change over time, and such change may be significant. Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s). Each Fund has a limited operating history and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Important Information This material must be preceded or accompanied by the prospectus. For all prospectuses, click here. Tidal Financial Group is the adviser for all YieldMax® ETFs. THE FUND, TRUST, AND ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERENCE ASSET. Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs) YMAX, YMAG, FEAT and FIVY generally invest in other YieldMax® ETFs. As such, these Funds are subject to the risks listed in this section, which apply to all the YieldMax® ETFs they may hold from time to time. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Referenced Index Risk. The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Index (or the Index ETFs). This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of companies that comprised the Index or an ETF that tracks the Index, even though it does not. Indirect Investment Risk. The Index is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, the Adviser, or their respective affiliates and is not involved with this offering in any way. Investors in the Fund will not have the right to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights with respect to the companies that comprise the Index but will be subject to declines in the performance of the Index. Russell 2000 Index Risks. The Index, which consists of small-cap U.S. companies, is particularly susceptible to economic changes, as these firms often have less financial resilience than larger companies. Market volatility can disproportionately affect these smaller businesses, leading to significant price swings. Additionally, these companies are often more exposed to specific industry risks and have less diverse revenue streams. They can also be more vulnerable to changes in domestic regulatory or policy environments. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political events, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may increase the Fund’s expenses. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTR, MARA, CVNA, HOOD, BRK.B, DKNG, RBLX), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Indirect Investment Risk. The Index is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, the Adviser, or their respective affiliates and is not involved with this offering in any way. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GPTY) Artificial Intelligence Risk. Issuers engaged in artificial intelligence typically have high research and capital expenditures and, as a result, their profitability can vary widely, if they are profitable at all. The space in which they are engaged is highly competitive and issuers’ products and services may become obsolete very quickly. These companies are heavily dependent on intellectual property rights and may be adversely affected by loss or impairment of those rights. The issuers are also subject to legal, regulatory, and political changes that may have a large impact on their profitability. A failure in an issuer’s product or even questions about the safety of the product could be devastating to the issuer, especially if it is the marquee product of the issuer. It can be difficult to accurately capture what qualifies as an artificial intelligence company. Technology Sector Risk. The Fund will invest substantially in companies in the information technology sector, and therefore the performance of the Fund could be negatively impacted by events affecting this sector. Market or economic factors impacting technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technological advances could have a significant effect on the value of the Fund’s investments. The value of stocks of information technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technology is particularly vulnerable to rapid changes in technology product cycles, rapid product obsolescence, government regulation and competition, both domestically and internationally, including competition from foreign competitors with lower production costs. Stocks of information technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technology, especially those of smaller, less-seasoned companies, tend to be more volatile than the overall market. Information technology companies are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights, the loss or impairment of which may adversely affect profitability. Risk Disclosure (applicable only to MARO) Digital Assets Risk: The Fund does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than the Fund. Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: The securities underlying BABO and TSMY are American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”). Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting, and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared ("cleared derivatives"). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house ("clearing members") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political events, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA, MSTR), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to CHPY) Semiconductor Industry Risk. Semiconductor companies may face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, and such competition may have an adverse effect on their profit margins. Semiconductor companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. Semiconductor companies' supply chain and operations are dependent on the availability of materials that meet exacting standards and the use of third parties to provide components and services. The products of semiconductor companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Capital equipment expenditures could be substantial, and equipment generally suffers from rapid obsolescence. Companies in the semiconductor industry are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights would adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

Title: Global shares are mixed, while Labubu maker Pop Mart soars 12.5% in Hong Kong

Nvidia, Palantir and other superstar AI stocks are dragging Wall Street lower again NEW YORK -- Nvidia, Palantir and other superstar stocks that surged in the mania surrounding artificial-intelligence technology are dragging Wall Street lower again on Wednesday. The S&P 500 fell 0.9% and was on track for a fourth straight loss after setting an all-time high last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 132 points, or 0.3%, as of 10:30 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.6% lower. Nvidia, whose chips are powering much of the world's move into AI, dropped 3% and was on track to be the heaviest weight on Wall Street for a second straight day following its 3.5% fall on Tuesday. Palantir Technologies, another AI darling, sank 8.1% to add to its 9.4% loss from the day before. One possible contributor to the swoon was a study from MIT's Nanda Initiative that warned most corporations are not yet seeing any measurable return from their generative AI investments, according to Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, global head of equities at UBS Global Wealth Management. But such stocks have also been facing criticism for a while that their stock prices simply shot too high, too fast amid the furor around AI and became too expensive. Nvidia, whose profit report scheduled for next week is one of Wall Street's next major events, had soared 35.5% for the year so far before Tuesday. Palantir had surged even more, more than doubling. The tech stocks still have supporters, though, who say AI will bring the next generational revolution in business. Mixed profit reports from big U.S. retailers helped keep the rest of the market in check, and nearly as many stocks rose in the S&P 500 index as fell. TJX, the company behind the TJ Maxx and Marshalls stores, climbed 4.6% after beating analysts’ forecasts for profit and revenue. It also raised its forecast for profit over its full fiscal year, while CEO Ernie Herrman said TJX is seeing “strong demand at each of our U.S. and international businesses” and that its current quarter is off to a strong start. Lowe’s added 0.2% after the home-improvement retailer delivered a profit for the latest quarter that topped analysts’ expectations. It also said it agreed to buy Foundation Building Materials, a distributor of drywall, ceiling systems and other interior building products, for about $8.8 billion. Target, meanwhile, tumbled 8.1% even though it edged past analysts’ expectations for profit in the spring. The struggling retailer said that CEO Brian Cornell plans to step down Feb. 1 and that an insider, 20-year veteran Michael Fiddelke, will replace him. He helped reenergize the company, but it has struggled to turn around weak sales in a more competitive post-COVID retail landscape. Estee Lauder dropped 4.9% after offering a forecast for profit this upcoming fiscal year that fell short of Wall Street’s estimates. The beauty company said it expects tariffs to shave roughly $100 million off its upcoming earnings. La-Z-Boy sank 11.5% after the furniture maker’s profit and revenue for the spring came up shy of analysts’ expectations. CEO Melinda Whittington said it’s contending with “soft industry demand” and that it’s looking at potential alternatives “to address financial pressure from non-core’ parts” of its business. The week’s biggest news for Wall Street is likely arriving on Friday, when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will give a highly anticipated speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. The setting has been home to big policy announcements from the Fed in the past, and the hope on Wall Street is that Powell will hint that an interest rate cut is coming soon. The Fed has kept its main interest rate steady this year, primarily because of the fear of the possibility that President Donald Trump’s tariffs could push inflation higher. But a surprisingly weak report on job growth across the country may be superseding that. Treasury yields have come down sharply on expectations for coming cuts to interest rates, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 4.29% from 4.30% late Tuesday. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed across Europe and Asia. London’s FTSE 100 rose 1.1% despite a report that said inflation in the U.K. rose more than expected through July, in part due to soaring airfares and food prices. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 dropped 1.5% after Japan reported that its exports fell slightly more than expected in July, pressured by higher tariffs on goods shipped to the U.S. Imports also fell from a year ago. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 0.2%. Shares that trade there of Chinese toy company Pop Mart International Group soared 12.5% after its CEO said its annual revenue could top $4 billion this year and announced the release of a mini version of its popular Labubu dolls. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Kirby Air Riders Is Cheaper Than Forgotten Land's Nintendo Switch 2 Edition

Kirby's new Switch 2-exclusive racing game is available to preorder for $70 ahead of its November 20 release. By Steven Petite on August 19, 2025 at 1:59PM PDT Kirby Air Riders for Nintendo Switch 2 $70 | Releases November 20 Nintendo has revealed the release date and price for the upcoming Switch 2 exclusive Kirby Air Riders. The sequel to the 2003 GameCube hit Kirby Air Ride warps onto Nintendo's new console November 20. Kirby Air Riders is available to preorder for $70 in physical and digital formats. No bonuses have been announced for Kirby Air Riders, but if any become available, they will likely be retailer-exclusive collectibles similar to the goodies being offered for preordering Pokemon Legends: Z-A. Kirby Air Riders costs $10 less than the soon-to-be-released Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of Kirby and the Forgotten Land. The physical edition of Kirby Air Riders is available to preorder at Best Buy and GameStop. Preorders should open soon at Amazon, Walmart, and Target. Like all Nintendo-published games for Switch 2 (so far), Kirby Air Riders is a true physical edition with the full game file on the card. If you opt for the digital edition, just be aware that the download size is currently estimated at 25GB, which is over 10% of the Switch 2's usable storage space. Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World $79 | Releases August 28 If you're worried about storage space for the digital version of Air Riders, you can double your Switch 2 storage for $35.77 with the Walmart-exclusive Onn 256GB microSD Express Card. The officially licensed Samsung 256GB microSD Express is in stock for $59 at Walmart. Kirby Air Riders is developed by Bandai Namco and Sora Ltd, the independent studio helmed by Masahiro Sakurai. These days, Sakurai is best known as the director of the Super Smash Bros. series, but he's also the creator of the Kirby franchise. Kirby Air Riders is the first game in the series directed by Sakurai since Kirby Air Ride. Since Kirby is in every Smash Bros. game, Sakurai has never truly left the character behind, but he hasn't worked on a dedicated Kirby game since supervising the 2004 Game Boy Advance metroidvania Kirby & the Amazing Mirror. The Mario Kart-esque racing game expands marquee modes from Kirby Air Ride and adds new ones. The controversial single-button control scheme from the original has been replaced by a two-button layout where B is for boosting and Y activates special moves, perform tricks, and switch machines. New abilities and characters have been added to the roster. Along with Kirby, you'll be able to play as King Dedede, Bandana Waddle Dee, Meta Knight, Cappy, Starman, Chef Kawasaki, Magolor, Gooey, Susie, and Knuckle Joe. The main game mode from the original, City Trial, is back with a bevy of new features. This time around, you'll be tasked with finding machine upgrades scattered across a large floating island. You only have five minutes to secure your upgrades before heading to the Stadium to compete against computer players or friends in races and battles. Kirby Air Riders supports local multiplayer for up to four players on one console and eight players wirelessly. Switch Online members can compete in online events for up to 16 players. Need extra Joy-Con Controllers for multiplayer? Amazon has Switch 2 Joy-Con 2-Packs for $95 (was $100). Nintendo Switch 2 - Joy-Con 2 (2-Pack) $95 (was $100) at Amazon Kirby Air Riders' $70 price point matches other recent and upcoming Switch 2 titles, including Donkey Kong Bananza and Pokemon Legends: Z-A, which is scheduled to launch in October. Outside of Mario Kart World, the only $80 Switch 2 games so far are updated versions of original Switch exclusives with new content. Notably, this includes Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World, the Switch 2-exclusive version of the superb 3D platformer. Along with overhauled graphics, the Switch 2 Edition has the new Star-Crossed World story campaign. You're essentially paying for the $60 base game and the new $20 DLC as a bundle, so the comparison to Kirby Air Riders isn't exactly 1:1. If you're looking forward to Kirby Air Riders and want to spend some time with the series before its November release, there are plenty of options on Nintendo Switch. In addition to Forgotten Land--the first 3D platformer for the franchise--there are two traditional side-scrolling-platformers with physical editions: Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe and Kirby Star Allies. Kirby has also starred in multiple digital-only Switch games and numerous classic titles are on Nintendo Switch Online. One of the best Kirby spin-offs in recent years is Kirby's Dream Buffet ($15), which also happened to inspire a couple of the cutest Club Mocchi-Mocchi Kirby plushies around. If you're interested in the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of Forgotten Land, existing owners can buy the DLC and upgrade for $20. Newcomers can also save $15 by picking up the Switch edition and Star-Crossed World separately. Multiple of the best Kirby game deals right now are for UK editions at Amazon-owned retailer Woot. Switch consoles can play games from any region, so the only difference with these Kirby games is the ratings board logo on the cover is PEGI instead of ESRB.

Wall Street faded on Tuesday following drops for Nvidia and other stars that have been riding the mania surrounding artificial intelligence technology. The Dow rose 10.45 points, or less than 0.1%, to 44,922.27. The S&P 500 fell 37.78 points, or 0.6%, to 6,411.37. The Nasdaq fell 314.82 points, or 1.5%, to 21,314.95. The heaviest weight on the market was Nvidia, whose chips are powering much of the move into AI, the AP reports. It sank 3.5%. Another AI darling, Palantir Technologies, dropped 9.4% for the largest loss in the S&P 500. It's seen bets build up sharply that its stock price will drop, according to S3 Partners. Only Meta Platforms has seen a bigger increase this year in what's called short interest, in which traders essentially bet a stock's price will fall. Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, sank 2.1%. Criticism has been rising that stock prices across Wall Street have shot too high, too fast since hitting a bottom in April and have become too expensive.

Palo Alto Networks rose 3.1% after reporting earnings and revenue for the latest quarter that topped analysts' expectations. Home Depot's gain of 3.2% was the biggest reason the Dow did better than other indexes. The retailer reported quarterly results that were a bit short of what analysts expected, but it delivered growth in revenue. Viking Therapeutics tumbled 42.1% after the biopharmaceutical company released results from a clinical trial of an oral tablet that could treat obesity and other metabolic disorders. Tegna rose 4.3% after Nexstar Media Group said it will buy the owner of 64 television stations across the country for $22 per share in cash. Copyright 2025 Newser, LLC. All rights reserved.

Wall Street faded on Tuesday following drops for Nvidia and other stars that have been riding the mania surrounding artificial-intelligence technology. The S&P 500 fell 0.6% for a third straight loss, though it remains near its all-time high set last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 10 points, or less than 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite slumped 1.5%. The heaviest weight on the market was Nvidia, whose chips are powering much of the move into AI. It sank 3.5%. Another AI darling, Palantir Technologies, dropped 9.4% for the largest loss in the S&P 500. It’s seen bets build up sharply that its stock price will drop, according to S3 Partners. Only Meta Platforms has seen a bigger increase this year in what’s called “short interest,” where traders essentially bet a stock’s price will fall. Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, sank 2.1%. Air Canada said it has gradually restarted operations after reaching an agreement early on Tuesday with the union for 10,000 flight attendants to end a strike that disrupted the travel plans of hundreds of thousands of travelers. The agreement came after Canada’s biggest airline and the union resumed talks late Monday for the first time since the strike began over the weekend, affecting about 130,000 travelers a day at the peak of the summer travel season. Air Canada said flights started Tuesday afternoon.

ByAntonio Pequeño IV ByAntonio Pequeño IV, Forbes Staff. Software analytics firm Palantir is plummeting on the stock market Tuesday, with shares falling 9% as other AI darlings like NVIDIA and Meta cool down from gains made earlier this month. Palantir shares were down 9% on Tuesday afternoon at $157.91, erasing strong gains made by the company after it topped Wall Street estimates and hiked its full-year guidance in its latest earnings report this month. Tuesday’s slump marked the company’s fifth consecutive day of losses as it trades down 15.5% since Aug. 13. Multiple outlets have linked Palantir’s tumble to a short report from Citron Research that says the company’s stock is overvalued, citing OpenAI’s $500 billion valuation and noting if OpenAI’s price-to-sales was applied to Palantir, the company’s stock would trade at $40—a massive drop from its $159.15 per share. NVIDIA shares slipped as low as 3% hours before close, also erasing gains that began near the start of the month. Meta’s stock fell nearly 2% to $753.43 per share Tuesday afternoon, adding on to its 3% drop in share price on Monday. The Nasdaq fell 1.4% in midday trading.

Cryptocurrency stocks also tumbled Tuesday, with Coinbase shares falling nearly 5%, Robinhood falling more than 5% and Bitcoin sliding 2.4% amid a two-day crypto pullback. $1 billion. That is how much Palantir reported in quarterly revenue this month, marking the first time the firm has surpassed the milestone earnings number. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman commented on the state of the AI bubble to The Verge last week, telling the outlet, “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes,” adding, “Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes.” Zooming out, Palantir’s recent stock struggles are part of a wildly successful year for the company’s shares, which are up 110% since the start of the year, when they were priced at $75.19. Investors have been wowed by the company’s AI tools, which likely played a large role in Palantir securing a $10 billion deal with the Army that consolidates 75 contracts into one arrangement, according to Axios. Palantir expects more growth this year, boosting its guidance and anticipating revenues between $4.14 billion and $4.15 billion for the full year, up from its previous expectations of $3.89 billion to $3.90 billion. Palantir’s success comes as the Trump administration has pushed for greater AI and chip infrastructure in the U.S., roping in financial commitments companies like Apple, NVIDIA, OpenAI and even considering a 10% stake in Intel, shares of which rocketed 7% Tuesday.

Title: Will Opendoor Stock’s Rally Continue?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Opendoor Technologies stock (NASDAQ:OPEN), which operates a digital platform for buying and selling residential real estate along with title insurance and escrow services in the United States, has fared exceedingly well over the past week. The stock rose 19% in Monday’s trading and remains up almost 60% over the past five trading sessions. So what’s fueling the rally? Opendoor has drawn renewed attention as a meme stock - a term used for stocks that surge largely due to hype on online forums and retail trading momentum, rather than on fundamentals. Moreover, the short interest stands at roughly 23% of outstanding shares, which results in sharp price spikes when trading activity intensifies. That said, shares are still down almost 90% from their SPAC-era peaks, although they have more than doubled year-to-date, underscoring how much of the surge is driven by sentiment and momentum. The rally has also been supported by a few company-specific developments. Opendoor recently announced its CEO would step down, a move investors greeted with enthusiasm, even through the rationale remains unclear. The company’s second-quarter results also modestly topped expectations, with both revenue of $63 million and EBITDA of $6 million coming in ahead of projections. related: META Stock: Path To 2x Growth Momentum, Yes. Fundamentals, Not So Much Opendoor stock may have momentum, but the fundamentals tell a slightly tougher story. At first glance, its Price-to-Sales multiple of 0.5x looks cheap compared to the S&P 500’s 3.2x. But this multiple may be a bit misleading, considering that Opendoor books the entire home sale price as revenue rather than the spread it actually earns. It’s also notable that its margins are razor-thin (or negative) and the business is highly sensitive to cyclical market conditions. The company’s top line has declined at an average of 24% annually over the past three years, although revenue did rebound 14% in the last 12 months to $5.2 billion and rose 3.7% year-over-year in the latest quarter. Losses also persist, with operating income standing at negative $204 million (a -3.9% margin) for the last 12 months. Opendoor carries $2.2 billion in debt, largely tied to financing its housing inventory. While this is common in the instant buying model, it is risky given the thin margins and exposure to housing market swings. The company's current market cap is $2.8 billion and this implies Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 79.2%. That said, the cash of $789 million does provide some cushion for the stock. While OPEN stock appears risky, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 - S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Orezone Intercepts Further High-Grade Mineralization Below Life of Mine Pits Including 1.59 g/t Gold Over 48.00m and 1.09 g/t Gold Over 45.00m

August 19, 2025 07:30 ET | Source: Orezone Gold Corporation Orezone Gold Corporation VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Aug. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Orezone Gold Corporation (TSX: ORE | ASX: ORE | OTCQX: ORZCF) (the “Company” or “Orezone”) is pleased to provide additional drill results from its ongoing multi-year exploration campaign at its flagship Bomboré Gold Mine. The latest results are from the North and P8P9 zones, targeting the down plunge continuity of higher-grade sub-zones beneath the current life of mine pits. Selected Drill Highlights1: Patrick Downey, President and CEO stated, “These latest drill results confirm the down plunge continuity of multiple higher-grade sub-zones, with mineralized traces extending beneath the current resource pits, and remaining open at depth. The targeted drilling at the North and P8P9 zones further underscores the near-term potential at Bomboré to selectively pull higher-grade reserve pits to depth across the greater 14km long reserve defined trend. Of particular significance is the very broad sub-zone of mineralization at depth in P8P9. This zone does not appear at surface and is the broadest zone of continuous mineralization that has been intercepted at Bomboré, demonstrating significant exploration potential. The results of this concentrated drilling serve to complement the ongoing wider spaced step-out drill program, which is focused on identifying new higher-grade centers of mineralization both at depth and near-surface along strike. In H1-2025, approximately 30,000m of exploration drilling was completed at Bomboré. We are extremely pleased with the results and success of the program to date, which includes 1) extending North Zone footwall mineralization up to 200m below the current reserve pits along an 800m strike length (including 2.55g/t Au over 23.00m and 1.14g/t Au over 29.50m), 2) extending mineralization of the P17S high-grade sub-zone a further 300m down plunge (7.40g/t Au over 6.70m) and 3) identifying multiple broad near surface strike extensions (including 2.22g/t Au over 14.00m, 1.12g/t Au over 10.00m and 0.92g/t Au over 14.35m).3 Drilling will continue in H2-2025 on multiple fronts in support of the Company’s long-term goal of increasing Bomboré’s current stated global resource from 5 million ounces4 to a targeted 7 to 10 million ounces longer term.5 This is truly an exciting prospect with the ongoing hard rock expansions positioned to increase Bomboré’s overall production to 220,000-250,000 ounces per annum.6” North & North Hill Zone The ongoing drilling program continues to define and expand mineralized trends along the 3km strike length of the North Zone. Mineralization in the shear-hosted “Footwall Zone” is associated with rheological and chemical differences between siltstones and shales and the volcaniclastic footwall sediments. Gold grades are correlated with quartz veinlets with disseminated pyrite and arsenopyrite as accessory minerals. Ore shoots are developed where north-northeast trending steep-dipping shears intersect the northeast trending and easterly dipping footwall shear. Fold hinge and stretching lineation measurements confirm the moderate north to north-northeast plunging mineralization. The North Hill Zone, which sits east of the Footwall Zone, continues to deliver promising grades and widths with higher grades corresponding to increased extensional quartz veining. These veins occur between two steep-dipping north-northeast trending mineralized deformation zones suggesting on-going deformation has resulted in sites of dilation orthogonal to the steeper shears. The recent drilling was successful in confirming 1) the down plunge continuity of the higher-grade North Hill sub-zone beneath the life of mine reserve pit (including intercepts of 1.59g/t Au over 48.00m and 1.97g/t Au over 16.10m), and 2) further delineating higher-grade mineralization within the west dipping footwall shear (2.01g/t Au over 14.00m). Both of these higher-grade trends remain open to depth, and will be the focus of future follow-up drilling. North Hill Zone: selected high-grade sub-zone intercepts (previously reported7): P8P9 Zone The north-northeast trending P8P9 Zone is separated from the North Zone by an ephemeral drainage channel. Mineralization is defined over a 1.6km strike length with a width of 1.4km at its widest point. Discrete north-northeast higher-grade lenses occur within wide low-grade pyrite rich zones dipping steeply to the east. Similar to North Hill, zones of flatter lying extensional quartz veining are also present. Mineralization intersected in holes BBD1368, BBD1369 and BBD1370 demonstrate the potential for wide zones of mineralization with no significant expression near surface. Mineralization is hosted within a granodiorite unit with abundant disseminated pyrite with above background gold levels throughout. Of note is hole BBD1370 which returned 1.09g/t Au over 45.00m, within one of the widest mineralized intercepts on the property to date of 0.64g/t Au over 157.00m8. Overall, this step-out drilling at P8P9 was successful in extending this zone of higher-grade mineralization by a further 100m down plunge.

QA/QC The mineralized intervals are based on a lower cut-off grade of 0.28g/t in the Oxide+Upper Transition zone, and 0.45g/t Au in the Lower Transition+Hard Rock zone. The half-core drilling samples were cut using a diamond saw by Orezone employees. The samples were prepared by BIGS Global Burkina s.a.r.l. (“BIGS Global”) and then split by Orezone to 1 kg using Rotary Sample Dividers (“RSDs”). A 1kg aliquot was analyzed for leachable gold at BIGS Global in Ouagadougou, by bottle-roll cyanidation using a LeachWellTM catalyst. The leach residues from all samples with a leach grade greater than or equal to 0.25g/t Au were prepared by BIGS Global and then split by Orezone to 50g using RSDs. A 50g aliquot was analyzed by fire assay at BIGS Global. Orezone employs a rigorous Quality Control Program including a minimum of 10% standards, blanks and duplicates. The composite width and grade include the final leach residue assay results for most of the drill intercepts reported.

Strategy Inc. has bought more Bitcoin while markets wobble, adding another small slice to its vast crypto treasury. According to the company, it purchased 430 BTC for about $51.4 million, at an average price near $119,666 per coin. The move keeps Strategy in its familiar role as one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin. Based on the firm’s disclosure and SEC filings, the company now holds 629,376 BTC, which represents almost 3% of the total Bitcoin supply. Strategy has acquired 430 BTC for ~$51.4 million at ~$119,666 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 25.1% YTD 2025. As of 8/17/2025, we hodl 629,376 $BTC acquired for ~$46.15 billion at ~$73,320 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRC $STRK $STRF $STRD https://t.co/FLRjCKDMQO — Michael Saylor (@saylor) August 18, 2025 Reports place the aggregate cost of that stash at about $46.15 billion. The latest 430 BTC came after the company raised money by selling stock; proceeds from STRK, STRF, and STRD share sales — roughly $19.3 million, $19 million, and $12.1 million respectively — were used to fund the purchase. Michael Saylor also hinted at new buying in a Sunday post on X, captioned “Insufficient Orange.” The fresh purchase is the third consecutive weekly buy. That pattern shows the company is sticking to a steady accumulation habit. But in the scale of its holdings, 430 BTC is tiny — a routine top-up rather than a large strategic shift. Insufficient Orange pic.twitter.com/QcRT0RTzEg — Michael Saylor (@saylor) August 17, 2025 Reports have disclosed an update to the company’s Equity at-the-Market guidance tied to mNAV levels. The firm will actively issue MSTR shares when the market NAV multiple (mNAV) is above 4.0x. When mNAV sits between 2.5x and 4.0x, it will issue shares to buy more BTC. If mNAV falls below 2.5x, the company says it will prioritize paying interest on debt and funding preferred equity dividends. There is also a note that the company may consider using credit to repurchase MSTR shares when mNAV is below 1.0x. That guidance matters because issuing shares affects equity holders. Reports present this as a tool the company intends to use depending on market conditions. Bitcoin pulled back in the last week and the company’s stock fell alongside it. Bitcoin is down almost 5% in the past seven days and slid below the psychological $115,000 mark at one point. MSTR stock dropped more than 8% over the last five days, slipping from a prior close of $365 to roughly $357 in recent trading.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: Google readies its last stand in latest antitrust trial

12 passes left to attend the Digiday Publishing Summit This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → In the last week, the pending seismic shifts in the digital advertising landscape were underscored by Perplexity briefing the press on its intentions to capitalize on Google’s battles with the Justice Department. However, doesn’t everyone whose head office isn’t located in Mountain View, CA? The latest round of quarterly earnings calls demonstrated how companies are lining up to profit from Google’s woes. Truly, the fate of the industry will be decided in the coming days and weeks. Below is a roundup of the latest on what you need to know. Most immediately, Judge Amit Mehta’s expected remedies ruling in the Google search antitrust trial are due by the close of August, with potential Chrome bidders including Search.com and Perplexity — both of which publicized respective bids of up to $35 billion in recent days. Interest from OpenAI and Yahoo has also been noted. Elsewhere among Google’s various antitrust travails, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Google and the DOJ are entering the final stage of their ad tech antitrust battle, after Judge Brinkema earlier ruled that Google had illegally monopolized the publisher ad server and ad exchange markets, but dismissed claims related to the advertiser network. To recap, the DOJ seeks a three-phase remedy: opening data access for its ad exchange, AdX, open-sourcing the auction logic of its ad server, also known as DoubleClick for Publishers, and divesting both businesses. For its part, Google argues divestiture is not workable on several fronts, maintaining it is illegal, technically unworkable, and stifles innovation, especially as AI reshapes the sector. In recent days, both sides have submitted their witness lists for the upcoming remedies hearing in this trial, which contain dozens of names, including a slew of familiar ones, such as Andrew Casale, Arnaud Créput, Jay Friedman, Jason Kint, Stephanie Layser, and Michael Racic. Another notable (pending) name on said lists is PubMatic CEO Rajeev Goel, with either side reserving the right to call further witnesses to the stand, plus call witnesses from the opposing side’s roster of experts. The remedies exhibit list of both sides also involves dozens of entries, and perhaps most tellingly (in terms of the strategic underpinning of its argument), the DOJ’s includes a blog post entitled “A new chapter for the open internet — Change is in the air,” attributed to Prebid president Mike Racic. Here, Racic issues a “call to arms”, underlining the critical role of open-source technology in fostering a more equitable ad tech ecosystem, especially following the recent ruling from presiding Judge Leonie Brinkema. According to Racic, amid regulatory shifts and rapid technological evolution, the article also rejects consolidation in favor of broad industry-wide collaboration. In it, Prebid’s Racic invites all market participants — including Google — to join a united front built on open standards and transparent practices, advocating for solutions that can be implemented swiftly, “in months, not years.” Racic also argues that an open web cannot thrive under the dominance of a single player — it requires a community. Prebid positions itself as ready to lead but calls for a collective effort among publishers, advertisers, platforms, and technologists to reshape the digital advertising landscape around transparency, interoperability, and innovation. Google counters government arguments with behavioral remedies, including AdX integration with rivals, publisher data portability, and adjustments to auction logic. Subsequently, Google’s arguments are significantly more extensive — literally, hundreds of items have been prepared and entered into the courtroom documentation — with its witnesses including James Avery, Shane Goodwin, Jason Nieh, and Scott Sheffer. The remedies-phase exhibit list also includes several items of Digiday reporting, with those submitted offering an insight into the damage-limitation tactics it intends to employ in the coming weeks. Indeed, the submissions also seem to raise the point that some of Google’s efforts in recent years were magnanimous. In particular, arguments suggest that initiatives to deprecate third-party cookies would simultaneously improve publishers’ yield while also benefiting user privacy — presumably by nudging the online ad industry to rely more on first-party data. Elsewhere, the articles for submission highlight how other behemoths of the industry have deemed the behavioral advertising sector worth a gamble during the era in debate. Take, for example, Oracle Advertising — a 10-year run that cost the company $4 billion in acquisitions, before it recently shuttered its efforts. Meta and Microsoft, although a call in the plaintiff’s favor, are notable in that neither was able to make a success of the ad-serving business, Atlas. However, such players later performed a U-turn after they deemed the juice of publisher monetization as ultimately not worth the squeeze. Nevertheless, this does not mean that Google’s policies are precluding all competition. Ironically, Amazon’s continued rise is likely to be a key weapon in Google’s defense team’s arsenal. Elsewhere, defense lawyers are likely to highlight how Google’s policies and technologies far from hamstring the sector, with investors’ eagerness to continually challenge its number one spot in the market as vindication of the sector’s robust health, not one that is hobbled by the dominance of a single entity. Of course, the outcome, regardless of how the decision turns out, is likely to set the template for the industry for the remainder of the year, with mergers and acquisitions likely on the horizon. Trial proceedings are scheduled to formally recommence on Sept. 22, 2025, after a pre-trial conference on Sept. 15. “It’s Q3. Do you know where your discounts & rebates are? This is one of the first questions I would ask my agency if I led media investments for a brand.” — Dial-up Media’s Jared Lake underlines the need for transparency in the market, emphasizing how hiding margin leads to misaligned goals, which leads to less effective outcomes. Why Reddit is pivoting from social platform to ‘go-to search engine’ with COO Jennifer Wong Reddit is positioning itself as a “go-to search engine,” integrating AI-powered Reddit Answers with core search for rollout soon. COO Jennifer Wong says the push aligns with driving measurable marketing outcomes, particularly at the mid- and lower-funnel stages.

Title: My Mack Weldon underwear is still holding up after years of wearing and washing — here's why they're my absolute favorite boxer briefs
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/style/mack-weldon-underwear-review
Time Published: 2025-08-18T20:57:31Z
Full Content:
When it comes to underwear, men have three basic options: briefs, boxer briefs, or boxers. When it comes to which brand a man chooses for his underwear, the list gets a bit longer. Actually, it gets dizzyingly long. So when I find a company making boxer briefs I love, I stock up, and I've loved every pair of boxer briefs I've gotten to try for my Mack Weldon review. So far, that's three pairs. Not a huge stock, you might say. But here's the thing — each pair is still in superb condition. Whereas other boxers from other brands have come and gone from my rotation in that time, with waistbands stretched out, fabric worn bare, and other such issues, these garments are going strong, maintaining their support, comfort, and color, too, and that despite lots of use and washes. While all of my Mack Weldon boxers are excellent overall, they each have their own qualities, so let's break things down pair by pair. These are probably the best boxer briefs I've ever tried. They have just the right fit, offering comfort and support without compression. They're not snug like, say, a pair of bike shorts, but they're a far cry from the baggy cotton boxers you wore in seventh grade. I wear them during shorter jogs, during travel, and pretty much any time I want to keep things in place, as it were, when on the go (intense workouts or multi-mile runs aside). The fabric blend (50% polyamide, 33% polyester, and 17% elastane) offers plenty of stretch and wicks sweat well. The legs never bunch up with these boxers, which is much appreciated when I'm stepping into a meeting, in a shop, walking down a city street, or anywhere else where adjustments might be awkward. The 18 hours here doesn't refer to how long you can wear these boxers. You can do that for as long as you want. Instead, it refers to the period for which the fabric is allowed to rest after production prior to its use in constructing the garment. The result is a pair of boxer shorts that have a consistent, comfortable fit that won't change over time. These boxers are largely made of cotton and have a more relaxed fit, so I never use them for exercise, but for lounging at home or sleeping and taking it easy. They do ride up a bit under tighter pants, so just avoid that pairing. As with the Jersey boxers, because these boxer briefs are largely cotton, I don't recommend them for use during any intense exercise, as they just don't breathe as well as synthetic (or wool) fibers. On the other hand, these have a closer fit than the Jersey boxers, and they won't ride up your leg. Because these boxers feature antimicrobial Silver XT2 fiber, they prevent bacteria and odor build up, making them a great choice for extra-long wear, especially during travel. While hardly a bank-breaking price point, Mack Weldon's underwear is more expensive than options you'll find from myriad other brands. If you want to find decent boxer briefs for cheaper, I might recommend a three-pack from Calvin Klein for $32. On the other hand, if you don't mind paying a good deal for your boxer briefs and you want a pair with some unique support and anti-chafe features, you may want to consider the pairs we tested in our SAXX review, which offered a unique "BallPark Pouch." Also, watch out for a bit of ride up with the Jersey boxers, but you can avoid that by wearing them with looser pants and not wearing them for workouts. Mack Weldon boxer briefs have just the right fit. Each pair I have offers enough support to keep things in place but without making me feel constricted and without causing excess heat buildup. As I noted earlier, I've been weaning my three pairs in regular rotation for years now, and that means dozens and dozens of wash and dry cycles. Their colors have held, they're still stretchy and supportive, and they still grip my body evenly and don't bunch up or create lines visible through pants. Long story short, these boxer briefs are a good buy. While the price point of Mack Weldon underwear might be a bit higher than some men are used to, their value is beyond question. They are comfortable from the first wear and they hold up well over time, remaining supportive and without going threadbare, even after years of being tossed around in the laundry.

Title: META Stock: Path To 2x Growth
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/08/18/meta-stock-path-to-2x-growth/
Time Published: 2025-08-18T14:10:21Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. META stock (NASDAQ: META) has delivered 2x returns, rising from $370 in early 2024 to roughly $785 today. The company’s evolution into an AI-driven advertising leader, together with Instagram’s revenue strength and substantial infrastructure spending, creates several avenues for the stock to potentially double again. At just 28x trailing earnings versus Amazon’s 35x and Microsoft’s 38x, Meta screens as compelling value with meaningful upside. We’ll examine these drivers below. While META has rallied, if you prefer upside with a smoother ride than a single stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and delivered >91% returns since inception. Also, see – What's Happening With UNH Stock? Meta’s recent results show accelerating growth across key lines. Q2 2025 revenue reached $47.5 billion, up 22% year over year, and net income climbed 36% to $18.3 billion. Operating leverage is especially visible in advertising, where revenue hit $46.6 billion, a 21.5% increase. The 9% rise in average price per ad underscores Meta’s ability to command premium pricing through AI-enhanced targeting. Also, see – Meta’s Revenue Comparison. Meta’s core shift centers on AI embedded throughout its advertising stack. Llama models now drive ad ranking and content recommendations, marking a move from conventional social media ads to precision marketing. This is not merely a technical upgrade—it is producing tangible business results, with pricing power expanding quarter after quarter. The scale goes well beyond automation. Meta’s generative AI tools are gaining traction with users and advertisers, opening new revenue opportunities while optimizing existing placements. This positions Meta at the forefront of the industry’s transition to AI-powered marketing solutions. Instagram is Meta’s most valuable asset and fastest-growing revenue engine. The platform is on track to generate over half of Meta’s U.S. advertising revenue in 2025, up from just 7% a decade ago. This mix shift toward a higher-margin platform creates substantial room for profitability gains. Given that Meta’s global advertising revenue exceeded $160 billion in 2024, with nearly 40% from North America, international monetization remains a significant opportunity. As Instagram expands globally and rolls out new features, it provides a clear path for sustained revenue growth. Meta’s 2025 capital plans include state-of-the-art AI infrastructure, highlighted by a 5-gigawatt data center and over one million graphics processors. While the upfront spend is sizable, these investments help cement leadership in AI-driven ad optimization. The in-house Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) program signals a push toward cost efficiency. By replacing older GPU-based servers with custom silicon, Meta can lower long-term infrastructure costs while boosting AI performance—building a durable edge in the AI arms race. Despite cumulative losses exceeding $60 billion since 2020, Reality Labs remains Meta’s largest untapped growth option. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called 2025 a “pivotal year for the metaverse,” suggesting a potential turn from pure investment to revenue generation. Although the division posted $4.5 billion in Q2 losses, a successful transition could unlock meaningful value. Hardware sales, virtual experiences, and “personal superintelligence” applications could create entirely new revenue streams over time. For Meta to double from here, the company needs consistent revenue growth of 15–20% annually alongside margin expansion. Key levers include using AI to further lift ad performance, scaling generative AI across platforms, monetizing new surfaces like Threads, and enhancing WhatsApp’s business features. Financial scenarios suggest revenue could surpass $265 billion within three years, with earnings nearly doubling from under $24 per share in 2024 to over $45 per share in 2028. Even holding current valuation multiples steady, the stock could exceed $1,300 in three to four years. If investors assign higher multiples on stronger AI execution and profitability, shares could reach $1,500 or more—constituting a true doubling from today’s levels. The biggest challenge is intensifying AI competition. Cost-efficient offerings like DeepSeek raise the question of whether Meta’s large-scale infrastructure will preserve its technological moat. Regulatory scrutiny of social platforms could also restrict data monetization, particularly in Europe and Asia. Macroeconomic risks matter as well. A downturn could weigh on ad budgets across Facebook and Instagram, and higher interest rates may make growth stocks like META less appealing than fixed income. Related – Buy or Fear META Stock? Meta’s path to a potential doubling hinges on successful monetization of its AI investments. Its dominance in social advertising, paired with aggressive AI infrastructure scaling, provides multiple routes to sustained growth. The opportunity is real, but execution risk is elevated as competition intensifies across core markets. For growth-oriented investors comfortable with single-stock volatility, META offers compelling upside. Those seeking steadier exposure to similar themes might prefer diversified options like the High Quality Portfolio, which participates in Meta’s growth story while managing concentration risk through broader exposure.

Title: How to Optimize Your Ecommerce Store for AI Search (7 Steps)

A 14-day trial for premium features. 55+ tools.Free access for core features. Backlinko readers get unlimitedaccess for 14 days. 55+ tools. Boost SEO results with powerful keyword research Written by Leigh McKenzie More of your customers are using AI to research products before they buy. Are you prepared? To put this into perspective: Last year, you might’ve searched “best bed sheets” on Google and scrolled through a few links or a Shopping ad. This year, you’re asking ChatGPT: “I sleep hot and have sensitive skin. Can you recommend some breathable bed sheets that won’t irritate me?” Totally different input. Totally different rules for showing up. AI Search still cares about the fundamentals — content, crawlability, internal links, and high-quality backlinks. But now, your visibility is influenced by more than just your website. AI models reflect the full picture: It’s not just keyword targeting — it’s relevance engineering. Shoutout to Mike King @ iPullRank for coining this term. That’s where AI Search Optimization comes in. In this guide, you’ll learn how to: The future of ecommerce search isn’t about rankings. It’s about being part of the answer. This guide will show you how. Before you do anything, start here: can bots actually see your product content? When people started taking AI tools and chatbots seriously in 2022/23, some site owners turned to blocking their crawlers from accessing their site. But if you block the crawler, it won’t be able to serve your pages in its responses. Unless you actively took the step to block them, you shouldn’t need to do anything here. But it’s still worth verifying there are no lines in your robots.txt file like: The other aspect of crawlability to consider is how you’re serving your content. Because right now, bots from the likes of ChatGPT and Perplexity do not appear to process JavaScript (although Google’s Gemini can). If your content is being loaded dynamically, they’re likely missing it completely. That includes: If it’s not in the raw HTML, LLMs like these can’t see it. And if they can’t see it, you won’t show up in AI-generated product recommendations. To make sure you’re not causing crawling issues here, you first need to understand how your ecommerce platform handles JavaScript. Every platform is different: Next, check your PDPs manually. You can do this by right-clicking and selecting “Inspect” in your browser. Then press Command+Shift+P on Mac, or Control+Shift+P on Windows/Linux. In the Command Menu, start typing “javascript” and then select “Disable JavaScript”: Reload the page, and you’ll see how it looks without JavaScript enabled — in other words, how LLMs like ChatGPT see the page: In the Nike example above, the LLM would still see key info like the product title, description, and price. But in the example below… …it would see nothing. You can see on the right that there’s still page code loading. But nothing is actually displayed to the user with JavaScript disabled. Meaning AI tools wouldn’t be able to pull any info from this page. If you are using apps or components that rely on JavaScript to display key content, talk to your dev team about server-side rendering (SSR) or prerendering. The goal is to ensure all critical product info is delivered in the first HTML response. Further reading: What Is JavaScript SEO? 6 Best Practices to Boost Rankings Once your product pages are crawlable, the next step is making them understandable. Structured data — specifically Schema.org markup in JSON-LD format — helps systems like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google understand what your product is, how much it costs, whether it’s in stock, and more. In the world of SEO, we’ve long used schema markup to improve how our pages appear in traditional search results. Here’s an example of a traditional Google results enhanced with schema markup, appearing as a rich snippets: But for LLM visibility, schema helps the AI tools understand key details about your products. Which makes it easier for them to pull in your products when they’re making recommendations for users. How do we know this? Because Microsoft has told us. The tech giant, a major investor in OpenAI (behind ChatGPT), said: “[Structured data] makes it easier for search engines not only to index your content, but to surface it accurately and richly in search results, shopping experiences, and AI-driven assistants.” (Interestingly, Microsoft/Bing recommends combining this with IndexNow — a service that automatically pings search engines when you update your content.) Plus, using structured data just makes sense — it helps make it easier for complex machines to understand our content. Whether that’s a search engine or an LLM, providing more context is generally always going to be a good idea. Here’s how to use structured data to improve your ecommerce store’s LLM visibility: While there’s value in marking up other templates (like category pages, blog posts, or FAQs), your product pages are where it counts most. This is the data that LLMs and search engines will use to: Here are the fields to include: Use your schema to reflect reality, not just fill fields. But also add as much context as you can. If your product is eco-friendly, US-made, sweatproof — encode it. The better your markup, the more context LLMs have to surface your product in nuanced prompts. Check your schema is valid with tools like: Make sure the schema is present in the raw HTML — not loaded with JavaScript. Once your product markup is solid, consider adding: These all help build context around your product and can influence how LLMs present or recommend it. Once you’ve marked up your product pages, the next step is scaling an effective structure across your entire catalog. That’s where a high-quality product feed comes in. Structured feeds have been essential for Google Shopping, Meta Advantage+, and TikTok Shop for a while. And now, they’re becoming equally important for AI-powered discovery. Especially as platforms like Perplexity and OpenAI build out product recommendation systems. Think of your feed as the dataset LLMs will eventually pull from when answering questions like this: Perplexity has launched a Merchant Program accepting feed uploads, called the Perplexity Merchant Program. This lets ecommerce sellers have even more control over how their products can appear in AI responses. Plus, OpenAI is quietly testing ways to let store owners upload feeds to improve their AI responses for product recommendations. These feeds will likely drive future AI shopping experiences across chat, search, and even voice interfaces. So how do you set your product feeds up in an LLM-friendly way? To optimize your product feeds for AI, start with the essentials: Note: Tools like ChatGPT may still generate their own versions of some of these (like titles). But it’ll still typically use information from places like your product feeds to inform its responses. After you’ve added the basics, layer in high-value fields like: Use the same language your customers use. This means writing product information the way your customers actually talk and search, not how your internal teams or suppliers describe things. For example: Instead of: “Athletic footwear with moisture-wicking synthetic upper” Write: “Running shoes that keep your feet dry” How do you find out how they talk? Look at your customer reviews, support tickets, and search queries that already drive traffic to your store. For example, they might search for “cozy sweater” not “knitted pullover.” This can inform your title and description choices. Here’s how to submit your product feeds for three of the biggest AI interfaces. In 2024, Perplexity launched their Merchant Program. This fuels the platform’s shopping experience for Pro users. Your products may appear in carousel-style answers and shopping-focused prompts, and shoppers can buy without leaving Perplexity. You can find out more about the program and sign up here. OpenAI is piloting product discovery via ChatGPT’s “Search + Product Discovery” initiative. They’re exploring using uploaded feeds to power future buying experiences inside ChatGP. Fill out this interest form to apply. Google’s Merchant Center feeds power Shopping Ads, organic Shopping listings, and likely influence how Google’s AI systems interpret and surface your products in AI Mode and AI Overviews. Once you’ve put all the steps in place to make your ecommerce store crawlable by LLMs, the next step is to make sure they’re actually accessing your content and product pages. Here’s how to do that: Use server logs or your CDN (like Cloudflare, Fastly, or Akamai) to track requests from: For each of these bots, track: This helps confirm they’re discovering your content and gives you a baseline to measure progress. Keyword research is still important. But you also need to think about how your customers are likely to prompt AI tools when looking for products like yours. LLMs answer questions, interpret context, and make recommendations based on how people naturally speak. That means you need to rethink how you optimize for product discovery. Not by keywords alone, but by personas, use cases, and prompt formats. Your best-performing SEO and paid search keywords are still the foundation. They tell you: Use these to anchor your prompt strategy — but expand outward. As people become more savvy with how AI tools work, more and more shoppers are going beyond just typing in “best bed sheets.” They’re asking: Medium-length prompts: Longer, context-rich prompts: Your goal is to build context around your products that lines up with this kind of language and framing. Note: You can’t predict exactly what your customers will ask, and there are infinite ways they can do it. But thinking about prompts — not just keywords — will put you in a good place to be able to optimize your ecommerce pages for LLMs. Think in layers: This is how you start to think of your items like answers and solutions, not just products. Let this prompt structure inform your: LLMs can pull from all of it — so make sure you’re using the kind of language your real customers use everywhere. Even if your site is crawlable, your schema is perfect, and your feed is super optimized — LLMs still learn about your brand based on what people are saying about you elsewhere. They’re trained on massive web-scale datasets, so third-party content — like reviews, Reddit mentions, YouTube transcripts, forums, blog posts — can carry as much (or more) weight than your owned channels. If you want to show up in AI answers, your brand needs to already exist in the wider conversation. AI tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude all lean on third-party review sites and forums in their answers to brand and product-related queries. These are the places you’ll want to show up in order to be included in those answers: Showing up in these places is half the battle. The other component is how you show up. Ideally, you’ll want to be mentioned alongside competitors (“like Brooklinen but…”). And in the right, relevant context (“these are some of the best cooling sheets for eczema”). A lot of this is going to be completely out of your control (especially on platforms like Reddit). But good marketing practices can make it more likely that people will naturally talk about your brand in the way you want them to. Gaining LLM visibility is a byproduct of an effective multichannel marketing strategy. If you’re running a strong content program, building brand awareness, and actively participating in your category — you’re already seeding relevance. What’s new is the urgency: LLMs are already using these signals to decide which brands deserve to be recommended. Related: See our LLM Seeding Playbook for tactics, templates, and outreach strategies. In traditional SEO, visibility was deterministic: rank #1 for a keyword, get X% of clicks. That model is breaking. AI-powered discovery works differently. Your brand might appear in one version of a response, but not the next. Whether your ecommerce store is included depends on how the user phrases their prompt, how much brand recognition you have, and how often you’re referenced across the web. So, your measurement strategy needs to adapt. Start by building a prompt library — real questions your customers might ask: Here’s how it looks in Semrush’s AI SEO Toolkit: For each prompt, ask: Over time, this gives you a clearer picture of how visible your brand is across different use cases. AI-driven search is already reshaping how people discover products. The shift is subtle now, but it won’t stay that way for long. What used to be a clear SEO vs. paid search strategy is now blending into a broader question: When someone asks a smart machine what to buy… will it know you exist? This guide gave you a playbook to start answering that question: It’s a lot. But the good news? If you’ve already invested in great products, strong messaging, and a multi-channel strategy, you’re not starting from scratch. Still need help nailing the fundamentals?

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA Enterprise and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply. Listing the best movies of a given decade has become something of an IndieWire tradition over the last few years, starting with the countdown we put together for our ’90s Week extravaganza in 2022, continuing with the ’80s the following year, and… then abruptly jumping forward in time to the ’00s the year after that. The problem wasn’t that we don’t love ’70s cinema — the problem was that we love ’70s cinema way too much. And way too much of it. The prospect of putting together a top 100 list that still didn’t have room for the likes of “M*A*S*H,” “Brewster McCloud,” The Long Goodbye,” or “California Split” seemed deeply perverse, and that’s just accounting for the work of a single filmmaker. No “Close Encounters of the Third Kind”? No “That Obscure Object of Desire”? No “House,” “Holy Mountain,” or “Half a Loaf of Kung Fu”!? It’s hard to even see the point of trying, and some of you might find it that much harder after parsing the movies that ultimately made the cut now that we’ve finally decided to wrap our hands around one of the most vital — and turbulent — decades the movies have known thus far. Born from the chaos of the 1960s and screaming headlong into a future that still seemed to be up for grabs (even as fears, optimistically dubbed “paranoid,” began to deepen about the powers that really hold this planet in their grip), the films of the ’70s reflect a world that was trying to make sense of its own violent potential. It was a time of ecstatic creativity that saw the emergence of New Hollywood, blaxploitation, and a blockbuster culture that was more compelled by greatness than opening weekend grosses; that saw American cinema look up to the stars with one eye and back down towards its own past with the other. It was also a time of profound reckoning, as established giants like Med Hondo, Nagisa Ōshima, and Pier Paolo Pasolini confronted the rot of history with a clarity and fearlessness that has seldom been seen since. And perhaps more than anything else, it was a time of cocaine. Just incredible amounts of cocaine. In a decade whose movies were so vast and varied, cocaine might be the only thing that many of the ones on this list ultimately have in common. Cocaine and Al Pacino. So after much consternation we present to you, at last, IndieWire’s list of the 100 Best Movies of the 1970s. This article includes contributions from: Carlos Aguilar, Christian Blauvelt, Sam Bodrojan, Wilson Chapman, Jake Cole, Rance Collins, David Ehrlich, Kate Erbland, Alison Foreman, Proma Khosla, Ryan Lattanzio, Vikram Murthi, Tambay Obenson, Katie Rife, and Christian Zilko. IndieWire’s ‘70s Week is presented by Bleecker Street’s “RELAY.” Riz Ahmed plays a world class “fixer” who specializes in brokering lucrative payoffs between corrupt corporations and the individuals who threaten their ruin. IndieWire calls “RELAY” “sharp, fun, and smartly entertaining from its first scene to its final twist, ‘RELAY’ is a modern paranoid thriller that harkens back to the genre’s ’70s heyday.” From director David Mackenzie (“Hell or High Water”) and also starring Lily James, in theaters August 22. A film like “The Sugarland Express” is proof that some legends are just built different. Directing his first theatrically released film at 28 years old, Steven Spielberg practically emerged from the womb with all of the characteristics that would make him the biggest Hollywood director of the next half century: the effortless command of spectacle that always knows when to take a backseat to storytelling, the buttery smooth camera movements that seamlessly shift focus without ever letting viewers know it’s happening, and his unapologetic sincerity and deep belief in the dreams of brighter days that Hollywood has always sold us. Many a modern viewer has watched “The Sugarland Express” expecting a trail of breadcrumbs that point to the development of a more mature Spielberg who directed his best films, but its pleasures are more immediate than that — “The Sugarland Express” is one of his best films, full stop. In Goldie Hawn’s Lou Jean, a young mom who will stop at nothing to get her baby out of the foster system, Spielberg found one of his most endearing protagonists. Her endless love, refusal to accept defeat, and good humor about the ridiculousness of riding in a cop convoy while holding an officer at gunpoint makes the character impossible to root against, and Spielberg is often happy to sit back and let Hawn’s charisma do all the hard work for him. “The Sugarland Express” is Spielberg at his funniest and most sincere, complete with stellar car chase sequences that foreshadow his blockbuster dominance, and beautiful shots of characters watching “Looney Tunes” that may well have laid the foundation for Sammy Fabelman’s eventual trips to the movies. Its legacy has been overshadowed by the colossal movies its director has made in the subsequent decades, but the film would be just as deserving of a spot on this list if Spielberg had never stepped behind the camera again. —CZ Agnès Varda’s “One Sings, the Other Doesn’t” is a musical about women’s rights, at once both polemical in its borderline-Brechtian lyrics championing birth control and body autonomy, and also eternally playful and inquisitive in the naturalistic study of its central duo’s friendship over many years. Classmates Pauline and Suzanne drift together and apart through the vagaries of life, each following a wildly different path but always retaining a connection to the other. Among other things, it is one of the most gently observed movies ever made about female friendship. One of Varda’s boldest experiments, the film blends various genres and styles. Inspired by a real abortion case, the film incorporates neorealist traits to the extent it casts one of the actual lawyers to recreate the court proceedings, but Varda also sidesteps into gorgeous tableaux vivants and adopts immersive editing patterns to convey the characters’ sense of time passing. And the occasional bursts of song add a dash of whimsy to topics the director takes seriously, using humor and warmth to bring into the open subjects that were still largely taboo in French society. —JC In a way, Edward Anhalt and John Milius’s script for “Jeremiah Johnson” crystallizes what Westerns have been chasing ever since: It’s spare, unfussy, and full of poetic character. But for all the ways in which “Jeremiah Johnson” has proven enduring and influential, this under-appreciated classic is a truly singular film at heart — a portrait of a true ‘70s loner who just happens to be living in the Rocky Mountains in the 1840s. Drawing inspiration from period vernacular and the poetry of Carl Sandburg, Anhalt and Milius’s script is laser-focused on the search for what really matters in life, and the search that happens within oneself. Director Sydney Pollack, proving his extraordinary range and gifts, opened himself up as well to find this movie in the edit, a seven-and-a-half month assembly process following a shoot all over the snowy wilds of Redford’s adopted state of Utah. Far more than “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,” “Jeremiah Johnson” is the real birth of Sundance — many of the landscapes here seem just a stone’s throw from Main Street in Park City. The result is both purposeful in the writing and loose enough to let in a real feeling of life, the kind of experiential rhythm that you can’t find in a studio. This is as quiet and most introspective as Westerns get. It also has one of the ultimate ‘70s cinematic moments, an instant that sums up the spirit of the decade onscreen better than maybe any other bit of dialogue. While those opposed to the Vietnam War burned their draft cards, Jeremiah Johnson deserts the army altogether, who were then fighting the Mexican War. Sometime after his abandonment of the fight he encounters a patrol of soldiers and asks if the war is still going. So much time has passed that the patrol’s officer isn’t sure which war he means. “The war against the president of Mexico,” Jeremiah clarifies. “It’s over!” comes the response. So then Jeremiah asks, his tone of voice perfectly calibrated to convey a mix of mild curiosity and ultimate indifference: “Who won?” —CB One of the great Upper East Side movies, Paul Mazursky’s feminist romantic dramedy “An Unmarried Woman” is also one of the most emotionally intelligent American movies of the 1970s: The story of Erica Benton (Jill Clayburgh), who must come to terms with her husband (Michael Murphy) leaving her for another, what-else-but much younger woman, and set out on the healing and hopeful path to reclaiming herself later in life. (While Clayburgh was in her mid-30s when Mazursky shot the movie, something about her feels older, wiser.) But “An Unmarried Woman” is also a sharp feminist text and richly lived-in-feeling portrait of New York City life. Clayburgh’s superb performance, which was Best Actress-nominated at the 1979 Academy Awards after winning that prize at the 1978 Cannes Film Festival, has a deft and deceptive lightness that gives Erica a sort of floating-through-life, almost gossamer quality that makes her at times tricky to read (and so therefore more fascinating to watch). It’s also extremely cathartic for the audience. Though Erica, an art dealer, eventually gets acquainted with Alan Bates as an abstract painter, “An Unmarried Woman” isn’t a romantic comedy in search of a match for its leading character. It’s a more naturalistic, minor-key character study that feels closer in spirit to an indie, landing on a great punchline of an ending as Erica trudges with a giant oversized painting in her arms down the streets of SoHo, a painting given to her by Bates’ artist. That Erica refuses to settle for an alternate relationship is what makes the empowering “An Unmarried Woman” so remarkable and even groundbreaking today. But just imagine that take in the 1970s, barely a few years into Women’s Liberation. —RL In the cinema of Jean-Marie Straub and Danièle Huillet, “The body keeps the score” is as true of the Earth itself as any human who trods upon it. Wielding a style of punishing austerity achieved through meticulous composition, movement, and editing, the filmmakers arrived at a singular meeting point between the classicism of John Ford and Charlie Chaplin and the avant-garde modernism of Robert Bresson and Bertolt Brecht. “From the Clouds to the Resistance” is one of the finest displays of their oeuvre, a testament to human struggle against oppressors ranging from ancient Greco-Roman myths of defying the gods all the way up to the antifascist resistances of the 1940s. Beneath its deliberately anti-dramatic surface of long takes and unemotional delivery of declamatory dialogue, the film communicates with lyrical beauty. Tree branches are used as proscenia to theatrically encase actors, and eyeline matches subtly establish power dynamics between their characters. Small fluctuations in natural light hint at shifts in those dynamics as one person or another asserts will against the other, and multi-planar compositions of landscape evoke painters like Cézanne while also silently testifying to the incalculable gallons of blood spilled on hills and dales over the course of human history and its endless wars. And for all the filmmakers’ Brechtian distance, they ultimately present a deeply human thesis of the capacity to endure and oppose even the harshest regimes of control. —JC Politically incisive director Lindsay Anderson found in Malcolm McDowell a wide-eyed and peculiar vessel to examine the economic inequities and ideologically corrosive nature of post-war British capitalism. Here, in the picaresque second film of their Mick Travis trilogy, McDowell embodies the perpetually cheerful lad as a coffee seller whose ambition and disposition earns him a rare upward mobility. As Mick travels across the U.K.’s northeast selling his unethically sourced product, his quick ascent and eventual downfall is interspersed with Alan Price’s musical performances. With lyrics like “Sell everything you stand for” or “Someone’s got to win in the human race/ If it isn’t you, then it has to be me,” the tracks are far from conspicuous, but their inclusion lends a cheeky undertone to a film that’s brimming with latent darkness. Anderson and screenwriter David Sherwin insert Travis’ evolution from idealism to disillusionment into the larger context of the Britain’s blood-soaked imperial past and its enduring consequences. As Travis becomes aware he’s just a disposable pawn, susceptible and perhaps even powerless to the whims of a system designed to chew him up and spit him out, McDowell’s expression turns from curious to utterly defeated. The character’s “luck” has ultimately run out. —CA Chris Marker’s three-hour ciné-essay takes a look over the preceding decade of global leftist movements and their various failures, from the student protests across the west to pushes in Soviet states for greater autonomy from Moscow. It is the latter that often proves the most compelling material for how little it has been covered in the west; in one of the film’s most transfixing sequences, Marker plays footage of Fidel Castro publicly declaring support for the Soviet Union’s invasion of Czechoslovakia to repress protests, lingering on the Cuban leader’s ambiguous expression for hints of self-awareness at betraying the higher ideals of revolution for self-determination. Marker’s pioneering form of half-studious, half-associative history has arguably become more relevant in recent years than it ever was during his lifetime, a clear forerunner to an entire genre of video content devoted to obsessive exegeses of politics and pop culture. Adam Curtis in particular is inconceivable without this film, but Marker’s overriding sense of play avoids the pitfalls of conspiratorial frenzy that besets so many of his successors. —JC Lino Brocka’s 1975 genre-bending fable is so dexterous an affair that you’d be forgiven for accidentally underselling it. It is a queer melodrama, a sociological survey of Marcos-era Filipino life, and a rollicking mystery. Without ever dulling the film’s gritty, anti-colonialist messaging, “Manila in the Claws of Light” remains prime entertainment. It feels miraculous that the film even exists in the first place — that Brocka did this, in front of a camera, with this many people, that it looks this good, and that it released to international success. Yet none of the aforementioned qualities are what lingers most vividly between individual viewings. The most striking aspect of the film is the infrastructure: The dirt piles next to a construction site, the market stalls built from sheet metal, the hand-painted menus at a restaurant. Brocka’s camera focuses so intently on these spaces because of he cares so passionately for the people whose spirit threaten to be crushed by merely inhabiting them. When I think about “Manila in the Claws of Light,” this is what first comes to mind. —SB In 1973, the Japanese equivalent of Walt Disney decided to adapt a 19th century book about the feminist history of witchcraft into an animated prog-rock musical about a medieval peasant girl who gets gang-raped on her wedding night and then turns to Satan for help with her revenge. This is really a thing that happened. See it even once and you’ll never forget that it did. Strange even by the psychedelic standards of its time, Eiichi Yamamoto’s wild and exhausting “Belladonna of Sadness” is a sinister anime fairytale inspired by the same fetish for medievalism that gripped Jacques Demy and Pier Paolo Pasolini, layered in recursive prog-rock jams, and filled with enough vaginal imagery to make Georgia O’Keeffe blush. From that imagery erupts the film’s vivid approach to sexual violence, as the heroine’s assault is symbolized by the sight of her naked body being cleaved in two down the middle like a butchered animal carcass, blood flying out of wound in the form of bats that flap off into oblivion. Few movies have ever so viscerally depicted the psychic toll of such trauma — the crime’s power to tear a person apart from themselves. Smarter than it is salacious, the film’s narrative complements its Eurocentric art style, further distancing “Belladonna of Sadness” from the world of hentai and locating it instead in a Western history where women are positioned as angels of liberty, and witchcraft their way of rebelling against institutional misogyny. History has a habit of prizing women for their sexuality one minute and punishing them for it the next, and Yamamoto’s film reflects that dynamic down to its core. This is a story about men who are in the thrall of a woman’s beauty, and then enraged by their inability to control it. It continues to prove moving, even in its (budget-enforced) stillness. —DE A tumbleweed-like tour across a broken country that’s trying to get back on its feet as the horrors of the Vietnam War come to a close, Jerry Schatzberg’s painfully unforgiving “Scarecrow” is a story about two drifters who give each other a sense of direction even though neither of them has anywhere left to go. Max Millan (Gene Hackman) is a short-tempered ex-con who looks askance at everyone he meets. Frances Lionel “Lion” Delbuchi (Al Pacino) is a stunted and guileless former sailor who dreams of reconnecting with his ex in Pittsburgh — and of becoming a father to the child he’s never met. These odd vagabonds make for a strained and unlikely pair of friends, but Lion’s puppy dog naivete turns out to be the perfect counterweight to Max’s cynicism, and it isn’t long before these two men are supporting each other in a way that no one else ever has. Shadowed by a deep and implacable darkness from the moment it starts, “Scarecrow” endures — and even offers its own strange kind of comfort — because of the lightning-in-a-bottle frisson it captures between its lead characters, whose tetchy dynamic was reflected in the conflicting styles of the actors who played them. Hackman’s introspective reserve clashed with Pacino’s method immersion, and though both actors were at the height of their powers, it took all of their combined talent to make it through a scene without snapping. That barely contained explosiveness lends an extra poignancy to the strength that Max and Lion give to and take from each other; it builds and builds until the point where their friendship starts to seem like it could point towards true north in a world that’s lost its moral compass. Alas, it leads them somewhere else in the end, as “Scarecrow” resolves as an indelibly American reminder that moving forward isn’t as simple as finding a way to get there. —DE Robert Bresson shook up his image as an imposing, aesthetically spartan moralist “Four Nights of a Dreamer,” which unmoors his usually materialist cinema into the realm of fantasia. Inspired by Dostoevsky’s short story, “White Nights,” the film follows the relationship that forms between a suicidal young woman and the stranger who attempts to convince her to live. Bresson retains his economy of storytelling to capture the caution with which both people open up to each other, but elsewhere he indulges in the most delicate and effervescent camera work of his career. At times, the film verges on comedy, if not outright self-parody. In a brief film-within-the-film moment, Bresson renders the bare plot as a quasi-thriller as if to show he could make more traditionally crowd-pleasing fare if he wished, and he reworks the ending of the source story as a bleakly funny punchline on the smitten protagonist’s presumption of possible romance with his rescued damsel. And yet, the underlying interest of Bresson’s filmography — the elusive search for truth in any of its forms — is as present here as his more feted works. For Bresson, the “meet-cute” becomes a means of unpacking the entire spiritual possibilities of love. —JC When talking about ‘70s culture, words like “paranoid” and “anti-establishment” loom so heavily in the air that it’s easy to lose sight of their meaning and use them exclusively as aesthetic descriptors. But even after 50 years, a film like “Dog Day Afternoon” makes it impossible to reduce the social unrest it depicts to grooming choices and editing styles. No amount of philosophizing disgrace and criticizing fears could convince a viewer that the society Sydney Lumet depicts isn’t on the brink of collapse — or, at the very least, isn’t convinced of its own imminent downfall. Even by the comparably low standards of the antihero-loving ‘70s, Sonny Worzik is not the kind of hero that a healthy civilization turns its eyes to in times of need. A chaos agent with all the poise of a chainsaw juggler in their first day on the job, his impulsive bank robbery devolves into a hostage situation in the blink of an eye. Fueled by little more than a deep belief that nobody’s promises are worth the paper they’re printed on, his make-things-up-as-he-goes approach to negotiation is the work of a man who feels so utterly invisible that he’ll settle for making enough noise to be noticed. On a technical narrative level, “Dog Day Afternoon” is as gripping a thriller as they come. As a social artifact, it’s one of the definitive examples of the chaos that was seeping into every crack of the American consciousness. Sonny only gains momentum from his admirers as he invokes the Attica prison riots, cultivating the crowd’s anger into a collective demand to see someone, anyone, do something to upset the powers that be. It’s all futile, as there’s only one way that a movie like this can end, but few films have ever reflected that futility with so much fire. —CZ Nicolas Roeg’s “Walkabout” was only the British director’s second feature after 1970’s “Performance” heralded him as an independent moviemaker to watch — and one with a special predilection for unique cross-cutting that felt like a fascinating new riff on the French New Wave. With one of the decade’s most indelible prologues, his film thrusts us into the arid wilds of the Australian Outback, where two English schoolchildren (played by Jenny Agutter and Luc Roeg, the director’s son) are unceremoniously dumped by their depressed father after he tries to kill them, and only ends up killing himself. At the same time, their paths as they try to survive in the desert collide with a Black Aboriginal boy (David Gulpilil, who went on to have a huge film career of his own after this breakout debut) who is on the rite-of-passage journey of which the title gets its name. Still streaked by Roeg’s nihilistic worldview despite the potentially heartwarming center, the unsentimental and briskly told “Walkabout” is also a brutal and unsparing portrait of survival in the wilderness. And speaking of cross-cutting, it’s perhaps most famous for a scene in which Agutter is seen swimming naked, juxtaposed against Gulpilil mercilessly hunting down Outback wildlife. “Walkabout” is a movie all about juxtapositions — man vs. nature, the modern vs. the ancient, the landscape vs. the colonial human forces cutting into and against it. But the tenuous bond that forms between the siblings and the boy, who doesn’t speak a lick of the English language, suggests in cinematic terms how those opposing forces ultimately could (and should) coexist. —RL Akio Jissoji careened from the populist Japanese TV of “Ultraman” to the heights of the nation’s avant-garde with this, the first of a trio of films inspired by Buddhist philosophy. Setting up a morality play in which a monastery attempts to intervene in a local case of youthful sexual indiscretion prove disastrous, the film pivots almost instantly into an abstract self-examination of human contradictions that mingles Middle Path precepts with Marxist dialectics. Not unlike the films of John Cassavetes, “This Transient Life” uses manic theatricality as a means of unpacking subtle emotional complexity, finding grounded and relatable foibles in garish extremes. Throughout, Jissoji puts his camera everywhere except where you’d expect it to be, capturing the drama in de-centered, wide-angled frames that only exacerbate the feeling of the characters being distorted and magnified for study. Rarely has the notion of characters being put under a microscope felt more literally true. —JC Barbet Schroeder’s remarkable documentary was billed as a “self-portrait” for good reason. Uganda’s brutally despotic then-president, Idi Amin, agreed to be filmed on his own terms, confident in how he wanted to be seen. Schroeder let him perform for the camera with minimal intervention, which represented a seismic directorial choice unto itself. “General Idi Amin Dada: A Self-Portrait” doesn’t analyze Amin’s power — it lets us see how power presents itself. What results is both document and spectacle: a record of one man’s delusion, and a warning about how easily image can replace truth. Nearly 50 years later, it still disturbs by showing what happens when control of the camera becomes part of the performance. —TO Akira Kurosawa was so disheartened by the failure of 1970’s Gorky-esque “Dodes’ka-den” that he tried taking his own life. Despite surviving the attempt, Kurosawa was still resigned to the fact that he was unlikely to receive funding ever again. So when the 63-year-old auteur was approached by the Soviet film studio Mosfilm to spend almost two years in the taiga adapting Vladimir Arsenyev’s epic novel “Dersu Uzala” (a book that he had supposedly been fascinated by since the earliest days of his career), Kurosawa wasn’t exactly in a position to say no. The resulting film turned a profit, won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and allowed the “Seven Samurai” director to keep working for another 18 years — a period that saw the creation of the late-career masterpieces “Kagemusha” and “Ran.” But here’s the thing: “Dersu Uzala” is as great as those films — as raw and ravishing as anything Kurosawa ever made. Nature had always played an ambient role in his films, but here, in the story of a czarist expedition to the extremes of Russia’s Far East in the early 20th century, it would become the director’s primary subject. The heart of the story is the growing friendship between the leader of the expedition and a Goldi (or Nanai) hunter named Dersu Uzala who serves as their guide. A number of set pieces stand out, most of all the wildfire that consumes a wheat field, which is given extra dimension by the faded otherworldliness of SovColor — Kurosawa would later pay more explicit tribute to Van Gogh in “Dreams,” but this is the movie of his that most resembles one of the Dutch master’s paintings. A committed leftist his whole life, Kurosawa also found in this story one of cinema’s most profound explorations of colonialism and the impossibility of indigenous people continuing their way of life untrammeled by imperial forces. The animist Goldi believe that nothing can truly be owned, that everything living has a spirit, whereas the Russian forces maintain that everything can quantified and acquired. The tragedy sparked from those two conflicting perspectives is every bit as haunting today as it was 50 years ago. —CB The ‘70s were the decade when cinema was formally established as a field worthy of academic study, and one of the things that was regularly discussed in university film classes was the attempt at finding “a new language for film.” Traditionalist Luchino Visconti was in pursuit of the same with his adaptation of Thomas Mann’s “Death in Venice,” which sees newly widowed Mahler stand-in Gustav von Aschenbach journey to the Lido for “absolute rest.” As Dirk Bogarde’s ailing composer silently takes in the sights on his Italian vacation, Visconti delivers a portrait of subjectivity as potent as “Rear Window,” and with similarly radical sound design. Dialogue seamlessly overlaps with ambient noise as Gustav quietly observes the world against his ever-diminishing place in it, but that languid sense of despair is soon interrupted by the sight of Tadzio (Bjorn Andresen), a beautiful Polish teenager who becomes Gustav’s all-consuming obsession. Is Gustav’s fixation predatory, or is it simply that the boy personifies the lost possibilities of the older man’s life? Something to puzzle over. Until that central relationship is established (for his part, Tadzio barely notices the existence of Gustav at all), “Death in Venice” is comfortable to exist in the liminal space between the gorgeousness of its setting and the dread of its protagonist’s anxiety. It’s filmmaking to get lost in, and the ultimate apotheosis of Italian cinema’s inward shift away from Fellini-esque expressionism. Taken in the context of Visconti’s filmography, “Death in Venice” feels like a radical departure from the operatic eruptions of “Rocco and His Brothers.” It’s a film where slight glances, whispered introductions, and the silent offer of an outstretched hand are rich enough to signify the world entire. —CB Made fearlessly just a few years after the 1968 student protests in Mexico City, which resulted in numerous deaths at the hands of the government, Felipe Cazals’ searing indictment of how propaganda can incite a herd mentality — and result in deadly violence — remains as potent as it was when first released. The pioneering filmmaker structured his defiant narrative partially as a fake documentary featuring interviews with actors playing residents of the small rural town of San Miguel Canoa. Their accounts often clash with what we learn happened one night after the malevolent local priest, played with chilling nonchalance by Enrique Lucero, convinces the impoverished residents that a group of young men forced to stay the night in town due to torrential rain are students who’ve arrived to threaten their faith. Without proof of these claims other than the word from the man of the cloth (who operates with ulterior motives), the virulent mob unleash brutality on the visitors — who are in fact university workers, and not pupils. A cautionary tale about the perils of pervasive repression, “Canoa” endures as one of the darkest and most knowing films of its kind. —CA The complaint that they don’t make movies like they used to is as cliched as it is eternal, but watching “The Heartbreak Kid” in 2025 is a quick way to remind yourself how true it really is. The existence of a major studio release centered around a reprehensible man who starts an affair on his honeymoon — and then proceeds to meander through a slow-paced journey in which he learns nothing before the movie fizzles out with a whimper — would be unthinkable in any era except the New Hollywood of the 1970s. And yet, anyone lucky enough to track down a copy of this semi-lost classic can attest that it still holds up as one of the driest, funniest movies of the 20th century. Charles Grodin’s Lenny Cantrow is a man without a single redeeming quality, a smarmy sporting goods salesman who radiates so much selfishness that every institution holding polite society together seemingly dissolves in his presence. To be fair, nobody around him is that great either. His first wife Lila (Jeannie Berlin) is hopelessly naive and needy, falling for Lenny’s tricks for far longer than she should, even if their relationship barely lasts a week. And his second target, Cybill Shepherd’s Kelly Corcoran (because of course, a girl like that would have a name like Kelly Corcoran), is all too happy to let a newlywed man pursue her, seemingly only for the fleeting pleasure of the attention he provides. The only character with any redeeming qualities is her overbearing father who forbids her from dating Lenny. He’s the kind of cheap stock character who normally serves as an antagonist to be defeated in most romances, but the only person thinking clearly in this sick sad world, which should tell you everything you need to know about the morality we’re dealing with here.The all-star pairing of writer Neil Simon and director Elaine May renders the story with an appropriately unsympathetic gaze. Lenny barrels through the world spewing self-serving bullshit as he chases shiny object after shiny object, hurting everyone in his path who falls for it and leaving the few outsiders who see through him to shake their heads in disgust. “The Heartbreak Kid” is often labeled a satire of marriage, but that’s only a half-truth. May and Simon take a neutral stance on the practice itself, but make it clear that some of us are far too narcissistic to deserve it. And the film’s brilliantly abrupt ending illustrates that there’s no other institution that could successfully take its place, because the real problems lie within us, not the cauliflower. —CZ It’s hard to argue that Lau Kar Leung’s “Heroes of the East” is the best of the Shaw Brothers classics that came out of Hong Kong during the 1970s, as the decade’s — and the century’s — quintessential martial-arts studio simply produced too many immortal beat-em-ups for there to be a definitive standout. Nevertheless, this ultra-kinetic relationship comedy about the arranged marriage between a rich Chinese kung fu student (the great Gordon Liu as Ho Tao) and a deceptively meek Japanese woman (Yuka Mizuno as Yumiko) serves as the perfect stand-in for an entire golden age on a list like this one. Not only does “Heroes of the East” highlight a wide, wide variety of the fighting styles that were showcased across the Shaw Brothers’ filmography, and not only does it provide the most dynamic showcase for one of the studio’s greatest stars, but it also epitomizes how fluently these movies bent combat into a hyper-eloquent form of communication unto itself. In this case, that communication expresses a fierce cross-cultural rivalry between Chinese and Japanese styles — comedically at first, and then with growing intensity as a legion of masters from the land of the rising sun travel to Shanghai to prove that Ho Tao is unworthy of Yumiko’s hand. Scored by a symphony of chop! pow! sound effects, each duel is a discrete masterpiece of old school kung-fu choreography, and they build on one another in a way that turns the entire second half of the movie into an extended crescendo of balletic ass-kicking, the grand finale of which is made all the more satisfying by the respect Lau pays to both of the countries involved. —DE Ousmane Sembène’s “Ceddo” offers a vivid and exceptionally complex look at the nascent days of Senegal’s European colonization, but the actual time period covered by the events of the film is never firmly established. “I can’t give a date,” Sembène said when presented the question. “These events occurred in the 18th and 19th century, and are still occurring.” A Wolof-speaking people face a crossroads: Their king wants to ally with the Islamic forces that have been exerting a growing influence on their country, which would later become the modern-day nation of Senegal. The “Ceddo,” outsiders who refuse to be colonized by either Muslims or Christians, kidnap the king’s daughter as ransom to ensure that he turns away from Islam. Violence ensues. Western cinema is prone to stories of privileged male characters being marooned with their enemies, only to find shared values and common cause along the way. With history on its side, “Ceddo” inverts that hero’s journey, as it’s the king’s daughter Dior (Tabata Ndiaye) who finds a new perspective among the outsiders and ultimately fights against her father — a painful but rousing struggle that highlights the eternal war against cultural usurpation, and the crucial role that women must be allowed to play in that fight. —CB A soft but sexually charged drama against the stunning alpine backdrop of Lake Annecy over the course of a summer month, Éric Rohmer’s “Claire’s Knee” initially resembles what a hater of French arthouse cinema probably thinks all of the nation’s films are about. Its story tells of a middle-aged man named Jérôme (Jean-Claude Brialy) whose recent engagement has done nothing to slow his lust for other women. He develops a romantic interest in two underage girls as part of what can only be described an esoteric wager he makes while discussing sex and monogamy with a novelist friend (Aurora Cornu). When he learns that the younger of the two girls is in love with him, he makes a move on her out of recreation as much as anything else, only to be shot down because she doesn’t believe he truly loves her. He then turns his attention to her step-sister, forming an obsession with her knee that consumes his thoughts. But no plot summaries could ever hope to do the film justice, as “Claire’s Knee” has less to do with any individual human relationship than our remarkable ability to rationalize our desires and misdeeds. Jérôme never gets a chance to consummate his lust for Claire — nor, it could be argued, does he really want to. Instead, Rohmer masterfully illustrates the way possession and attainability (or the lack thereof) are inextricably tied to our desires. Every interaction is so profoundly overanalyzed and overcomplicated that it’s a miracle anyone has any fun at all on this miserable trip. The real lesson might be that when there’s a void of activity on a summer vacation, humans will naturally move to fill it. The lewd premise builds to the most chaste of climaxes, with Jérôme talking himself into being content with an utterly mundane (if sinisterly motivated) interaction. Because, despite all of its stunning scenery, “Claire’s Knee” is a film that takes place entirely inside its characters’ minds, with the mental gymnastics they perform to assign meaning to all of their endeavors taking precedence over the endeavors themselves. It’s one of the finest examples of Rohmer’s brand of cinema about destructively intellectual characters, and stands alongside “My Night at Maud’s” as one of his finest “Moral Tales.” —CZ Rainer Werner Fassbinder left behind a body of work that struck a precarious yet remarkably sturdy balance of experimental theater, postwar radicalism, and classical Hollywood melodrama, and “Ali: Fear Eats the Soul” is one of the great showcases of his malleability. Reworking the age-gap romantic yearning of Douglas Sirk’s “All That Heaven Allows” around the additional complication of race, Fassbinder brings together lonely, widowed empty-nester Emmi (Brigitte Mira) and hale young Moroccan immigrant Ali (El Hedi ben Salem) as an unlikely couple who rapidly developing affection faces constant tests from disapproving friends, relatives, and sneering passers-by. Fassbinder filters Sirk’s florid, intimate approach to melodrama through his own eerily pristine, at times ironically detached style. He frequently lenses in long shots that convey not the emotions between the couple but the icy, judgmental stares of others who watch them with revulsion. The film also highlights the way in which even the most obviously disapproving people will still put on a facade of cordiality that only makes their disdain sharper. There are also reminders of Germany’s grim recent history, as when Emmi takes Ali to an upscale restaurant to celebrate their elopement and reflexively boasts “Hitler used to eat here!” As both she and Ali feel the pressure from their loved ones to end their relationship, the emotions held at arm’s length eventually explode, leading to perhaps the most visceral ending of Fassbinder’s vast canon. —JC An obstinate seeker who hadn’t been able to finish any of the films he’d started, Errol Morris was on the verge of turning 30 when he stumbled upon a San Francisco Chronicle headline that read: “450 DEAD PETS GOING TO NAPA VALLEY.” Armed with new resolve, he gathered money from friends and family to closely investigate the story in the spring and summer of 1977. His friend, Werner Herzog, famously pledged to eat a shoe if the film was ever finished and exhibited. Though it technically explores pet cemeteries, “Gates of Heaven” isn’t much considered with its ostensible raison d’être. Morris uses pets, death, and small businesses as a lens to consider people’s voices: the manner in which they speak, the narratives they construct about themselves, the yarns they spin. The young director bent cinema vérité to his will by eschewing the de rigueur handheld style of the era in favor of a static camera and direct address. Morris’s locked-off medium shots not only called attention to his highly composed framing, but they also had the hypnotic effect of drawing audiences closer to his subjects as they wax (or drawl) poetic (or comical) about everything under the sun. When Morris screened “Gates of Heaven” for his idol Douglas Sirk at the Berlin Film Festival, he walked out halfway through, calling the film a slideshow. It’s easy to see how he arrived at such a conclusion, and, possibly heeding the filmmaker’s criticism, Morris would never deploy such stillness again in his career. But only the most stubbornly dogmatic viewer could ignore the cinematic spirit animating the director’s photographic compositions. Sirk also cautioned Morris about his film’s supposedly ironic pose, a humorous note considering how frequently the master of melodrama utilized irony in his own work. While Morris certainly mines comedy from his subjects’s eccentricities or quirks of speech, anyone who believes that he made “Gates of Heaven” as an exercise in mockery simply isn’t paying attention. Morris’s permissive interviewing strategy, which entails getting his subjects to speak for as long as possible without much intervention, doesn’t merely facilitate open communication. It’s also a sign of unencumbered respect for their worldviews. Take, for example, Florence Rasmussen, an elderly woman who lives across the street from one of the two pet cemeteries the film examines. She delivers an uninterrupted five-minute monologue about her life while sitting in her front doorway. Circuitous and contradictory, and gloriously “off topic,” her speech exemplifies Morris’s attentive approach: if you just let people talk, they’ll reveal the world. —VM A father has raised his children without contact with the outside world, and their lifelong isolation has warped their understanding of social norms. Yet the older they get, the more they question what’s beyond the walls that ostensibly cage them for their protection. The description may call to mind Yorgos Lanthimos’ Oscar-nominated “Dogtooth,” but it refers instead to “The Castle of Purity,” the breakthrough film by unsung Mexican master Arturo Ripstein. Inspired by a shocking case that came to light in 1950s Mexico City, the unflinching drama chronicles how Gabriel (Claudio Brook), a disturbed patriarch, walks the streets finding buyers for the rat poison that his wife and kids produce in their large home. He rules with the firm hand of an authoritarian at home, and though he forbids his family from eating meat or indulging in worldly vices, he doesn’t preach by example. Ripstein, who immediately recognized the inspiration that “Dogtooth” took from his film, is an artist recurrently interested in religious hypocrisy and the most sordid alcoves of the human mind; here, he depicts the abuse Gabriel inflicts on his household with sobering rigor, resolving in an unforgettable study of how evil has always found domesticity to be among its most convincing disguises. —CA A 15-year-old moppet named Mike (John Moulder-Brown) drops out of school and lands a gig at an East London public bath at the tail end of the swingin’ ’60s, where he’s preyed upon by the sexually underserved female clientele at the same time as he begins obsessing over his seasoned and inscrutable co-worker Susan (Jane Asher, fresh off a relationship with Paul McCartney). It’s Mike’s first job, and he doesn’t know that they’re not all like this. Plunged into a seedy but spectacular world that’s brimming with desire and steeped in confusion, Mike is soon at the mercy of his own lust for life — a lust that fixates upon Susan, and rages at all the reasons why she can’t belong to him. One of the only color movies that David Lynch ever loved, Jerzy Skolomowski’s darkly fun “Deep End” is as hyper-vivid in its production design as it is in its hormonal distress. Here is a film that sees coming of age as a delirium thick enough to drown in, as its naive protagonist — a virginal need monster who sees older men take what they want from the young women around them, and is too horny to recognize that they’re stealing — tries his best to stay afloat in the turbulent waters between free love and possessive ownership. Skolomowski’s almost psychedelic approach to psychosexual mania creates an unbroken dreamstate where nothing feels real but everything is. Where the world begs to be touched even as it remains just out of reach. Where Susan is both an inanimate crush object and a richly humanized character who’s already had to pay too high a price for her sexual currency (a dynamic that’s indelibly realized in the sequence where Mike steals a life-sized nude cut-out of a woman who looks just like Susan, and proceeds to project all of his desire onto it over the course of a long dark night). All the more true to life for its expressionistic flourishes, and for an ending that feels like it was ripped from the pages of a fable, “Deep End” announced the full possibilities of ’70s cinema with a fatal bang. —DE Widely acknowledged as the first home-grown Jamaican film to be shot with an entirely Jamaican cast and crew, Perry Henzell’s “The Harder They Come” is a shaggy-dog thriller that also happens to be a form-breaking smash (as radical as “Breathless” in its own right), and “the film that brought reggae to the world.” That’s the thing: Maybe you’ve never watched “The Harder They Come,” but you’ve absolutely heard multiple songs from its smash-hit soundtrack album. Many of them are by the film’s star Jimmy Cliff, but the tunes also include all-time bangers like “Draw Your Brakes” by Scotty and “Sweet and Dandy” and “Pressure Drop” by Toots & the Maytals. Take a look at the movie, though: Cliff stars as a wayward youth, Ivanhoe “Ivan” Martin, who grew up in the countryside but tries to make it big in the Kingston recording industry. Crossing paths with gangsters and a shady record mogul who only wants to pay him a one-and-done $20 for recording the title track, Ivan becomes a trigger-happy outlaw unwilling to play by society’s rules. It starts naturalistically enough, so much so that if you just flipped to it on TV you might think it’s a documentary at first. By the end, however, Henzell’s film actually plays more like late ‘60s Godard than “Breathless,” with scenes of militarized police pursuing Ivan on gorgeous beaches while meta touches — including the interspersed use of Sergio Corbucci’s “Django” — break down why we’re all so besotted by outlaw mystique in the first place. Even if the music gets more of the attention, the film itself is every bit as intoxicating. If there’s the cinematic equivalent of an ear-worm, this is it. —CB Long before indie cinema as we know it found its footing in the ’90s, Claudia Weill’s “Girlfriends” delivered a groundbreaking look at female friendship, ambition, and loneliness — all through the lens of one woman’s coming-of-age in New York City. Shot on a shoestring budget (and one that almost didn’t cut it), but with razor-sharp emotional clarity, “Girlfriends” is a landmark of American independent filmmaking and one of the most criminally overlooked gems of the 1970s. Well, overlooked no more. At a time when studio films rarely centered the interior lives of women, “Girlfriends” dared to tell a story about the complexities of female independence. Melanie Mayron stars as Susan, a struggling photographer navigating career uncertainty and emotional isolation after her best friend (played by Anita Skinner) abruptly gets married and moves out. What follows is a radical exploration of solitude, creative frustration, and the shifting dynamics of female friendship. Think of it this way, can you name another film that both Stanley Kubrick and Greta Gerwig have praised? Weill’s direction captures small moments with a documentary-like intimacy that feels years ahead of its time. There’s no melodrama here — just the authentic messiness of life in your twenties, portrayed with empathy and humor. It’s a film that doesn’t just pass the Bechdel Test — it practically wrote it. In an era dominated by antiheroes and epics, “Girlfriends” carved out something smaller, more personal — and in doing so, became one of the most enduring and influential films of the decade. —KE Hayao Miyazaki is most famous for making personal, original, idiosyncratic films about his favored themes: nature, environmentalism, pacifism, feminism, youth, and aging. But for his feature debut, when Ghibli was just a glimmer in his eye, he made pure franchise popcorn entertainment. And the result is a complete blast. “The Castle of Cagliostro” is a stand-alone entry in the “Lupin III” series, an iconic manga and anime franchise about the descendant of legendary gentleman thief Arsene Lupin, as he travels the world with his criminal gang taking on heists and outfoxing the determined Interpol agent Zenigata. In “Castle of Cagliostro,” his heist isn’t to steal money or gold, but a person: Princess Clarisse, who is being forced to marry the titular Cagliostro, a monstrous greedy count. It’s a perfect setup for some fun, and “Castle of Cagliostro” is fun above all else, a total action-adventure blast with setpieces like the car chase and the often-imitated clock-tower fight that rank among the most thrilling moments in the anime film canon. Miyazaki’s confidence and skill as director from the jump is a sight to behold. —WC “The Devils” is a blasphemous film, although the hysterical profanity and nuns lasciviously tonguing Christ’s side wound aren’t what’s truly heretical about it. Instead, director Ken Russell’s most vicious critiques of the Catholic Church appear in the small moments of spiritual repose playboy priest Father Grandier (Oliver Reed) finds with a woman he meets through the church. The Holy See’s perverse lust for power means that it would rather torture and kill innocent people than allow them to find God through each other. That’s what Russell’s condemning here. The rest is all set dressing — set dressing provocative enough that Warner Bros. has done its best to suppress the film for the past 50 years, but still. —KR What is left to say about a film like “Klute?” Alan J. Pakula’s call girl noir has had, at one point or another, every element of its craft rightly celebrated by critics in the 54 years since its initial release. The textures of the film — the score, the outfits, the light fixtures and how Gordon Willis painted with them — prove the aesthetic zenith of a bygone era in American cinema. In a genre where individuals are often merely synecdoche for institutional machinations, the romance between Jane Fonda and Donald Sutherland is disarmingly grounded. Fonda’s Bree Daniel is an idol of feminist cinema, and the film’s radically non-judgmental view of sex work remains admirable. In a world so obsessed with the contradiction of cinematic voyeurism and the symbolic martyrdom of rough women, Pakula pursues different questions with better answers. “Klute” examines the sensuality of autonomy, the messiness of adult intimacy, and whether acting in direct defiance of harms suffered can ever offer real solace, or instead further trap someone within their trauma. All of this is well-worn territory, but none of that matters when you sit down to watch the movie — even now, more than 50 years since “Klute” was first released, its allure proves totally singular. —SB Meiko Kaji was already bored with playing stoic badasses by the time she was approached for the title role in Toshiya Fujita’s adaptation of Kazuo Koike’s manga series. But she liked the director and the script, so she took the job. And thank goodness she did, because Kaji’s Yuki, an assassin trained from birth to avenge her family’s deaths, is one of the most iconic action heroines in all of cinema. Her graceful movements and intense stare are practically supernatural, an effect that’s enhanced by the striking production design and stylized carnage. You might think you’ve seen the color red, but you really haven’t — not until you’ve seen “Lady Snowblood.” —KR “Why would you choose someone who loves you too little over someone who loves you too much?” Charles (John Heard) asks his lover Laura (Mary Beth Hurt) as they’re tearfully breaking up. “Because it makes me feel less of a fraud,” she curtly responds. A toxically-romantic comedy adapted from Ann Beattie’s 1976 novel, Joan Micklin Silver’s “Chilly Scenes of Winter” chronicles a doomed affair between two aimless thirtysomethings in snowy Salt Lake City. Charles pines for Laura in between wasting away at his bullshit government job and dealing with his mentally unstable mother (Gloria Grahame), but he does so to such an narcissistic, self-destructive degree that his behavior would raise significant red flags in our current social climate. Part of the greatness of “Chilly Scenes of Winter” lies in Silver’s abject refusal to condemn Charles’s obsession with Laura; instead, she empathizes with his passion, even when he’s being pointedly unlikable or downright cruel. Heard’s holistic performance treats the romantic and spiteful streaks in Charles’s character as if they emanate from the same confused source rather than two sides of a split personality. His love is as genuine as Laura’s ambivalence, which extends in just about every direction —towards Charles and her failing marriage to her dull husband, but mostly towards herself. Silver’s sincere respect for the sheer realism of her characters—their messy personalities, the fundamentally tenebrous nature of their relationship, their asymmetrical love for each other—has no parallel in the domestic drama. Yet, it’s Silver’s choice to situate Charles and Laura’s mutual anguish within, as opposed to outside, life’s myriad headaches that elevates their relationship to unexpected cinematic heights. Overfamiliar bosses and lovesick secretaries, familial burdens and friendly obligations, the humdrum routine of going to work and feeding oneself in winter intrude upon Charles’s heartache. Neither his lovelorn desires nor Laura’s guilt can take priority over everything else in their respective worlds because there’s simply too many unsexy adult responsibilities to manage, until eventually the yearning becomes another chore. Silver acutely understands that casual tragedy of Charles and Laura broken relationship is that life didn’t stop for them. It just goes on and on until the pain becomes a distant memory. —VM In her dismissive review of “Seven Beauties,” Pauline Kael wrote that Lina Wertmüller “keeps her films moving by hurling salamis at the audience.” And maybe that’s true — after all, this withering dark comedy includes the most jarring close-up of a penis in the history of Holocaust cinema — but not in the way that Kael meant it. By 1975, the movies were already starving for new ways to visualize the greatest atrocity of the 20th century, which three decades of post-war cinema had already ossified into a dead language of digestible images. Wertmüller had to feed the people something. In that sense, her magnum opus is one hell of a meal. A larger-than-life Giancarlo Giannini stars as Pasqualino “Seven Beauties” Frafuso, Naples’ horniest and most flamboyant hoodlum, and a man whose utter lack of dignity is ultimately his only hope of enduring the depravity of a concentration camp. Combining the picaresque lightness of an old fable with the unfathomable horrors of real life — and using the subversive pleasures of grindhouse cinema to reinvigorate a nightmare the world is always on the brink of forgetting — Wertmüller’s greatest and most grotesque film had the temerity to think of survival as a virtue unto itself. In committing to that idea until the bitter end, “Seven Beauties” was able to prevent the Holocaust from becoming just another genre. Almost 50 years later, it still retains that same power. —DE A philosophical take on the vampire myth, Bill Gunn’s 1973 arthouse horror film features erudite characters, heady eroticism, and complex commentary on African-American ethnic and religious identity, all rendered in 16mm that shimmers in the summer heat. “Night of the Living Dead” actor Duane Jones stars, playing an anthropologist whose research into an obscure cult of African blood-drinkers gains a new dimension after his assistant (Gunn) stabs him with an ancient ceremonial dagger. It’s a startling work of art, one that was nearly lost after bad reviews led its distributor to recut it as an exploitation picture. Gunn’s version was eventually restored, and was remade by Spike Lee as “Da Sweet Blood of Jesus” in 2014. —KR Andrei Tarkovsky’s “Stalker” looks and moves unlike anything that came before it. To create one of the most immersive sci-fi worlds ever captured on celluloid, Tarkovsky relied on the neat trick of telling audiences absolutely nothing. We never learn when the film takes place or what country its characters hail from, only that there’s a dangerous place called the Zone where you can come face to face with your truest desires. It’s a harrowing journey to your final destination, which requires those brave enough to visit the Zone to hire tour guides known as “Stalkers.” That’s all we get before the Russian auteur launches us on an unforgettable journey through the contradictions of the human psyche. And it’s a good thing thing he keeps us in the dark so much, because anything else would be overkill.Tarkovsky fills the Zone with a combination of lush greenery and abandoned machinery, creating an undeniable image of humans fighting a losing battle with nature. Everything, from the tour guide’s warnings to the harsh landscape, suggests that mankind doesn’t belong here. That there are some truths lurking in the universe that we simply weren’t meant to know. It all builds to a climax that’s painful to wrap one’s mind around even after multiple viewings: Our truest desires are lurking so deep within us that there’s no guarantee that we know them ourselves. Tarkovsky was hardly the first to suggest that we’re imprisoned by our cravings and urges, but he crystallized their sinister and uncontrollable nature better than any filmmaker before or since. —CZ Martin Scorsese’s fourth feature showcased the director’s love for cinema — and for the actresses who built it — in its first frames. Shot by Marty’s pal Michael Ballhaus, this luminous 1974 drama kicks off with a nearly shot-for-shot homage to Victor Fleming’s “The Wizard of Oz” before opening up onto the world of Alice, played by Ellen Burstyn. Her delivery-driver husband, with whom she and her small son lived in a middle-of-nowhere New Mexico town, is killed on the job, and so they jettison to California in hopes of cobbling together a better life. Burstyn and Alfred Lutter, who plays Alice’ son Tommy, have an easy chemistry; he’s a child who’s been around only adults his whole life and can’t relate to people his own age, forced to fathom the dramas and dealings of those older than him. Alice and Tommy wind up in Arizona, where she takes up a job at a folksy diner in hopes of scrounging up enough change to get all the way to California. Their time in Phoenix surrounds a lovely, leisurely plot where Alice gets into yet another bad relationship. Fabulous minor roles are played by the likes of Diane Ladd as another waitress at the cafe, who has an angry and witty tongue, and Jodie Foster as a tomboy Tommy later meets in Tucson. This and “Mommy Dearest” were the only films screenwriter Robert Getchell was really known for. The gentle lilt and warmth of this kitchen-sink drama — really the last from Scorsese — make for a refreshing entree into the filmmaker’s meaner and more viscerally pungent later work. It’s the rare portrait of an intelligent and funny woman who stands on her own, even as she’s wobbling, in the director’s mostly male-driven filmography. For all the grief he’s gotten because of that slant, “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore” remains one of the very best things he’s ever made. —RL No one could extract deep meaning from static landscapes like Chantal Akerman, and the “Jeanne Dielman” filmmaker’s juxtaposition of avant-garde structure and raw emotion was never more potent than in “News From Home.” In 1976, Akerman returned to New York City, where she lived for two years while finding her footing as an artist. There, she observed once-familiar settings made distant not only by time, but by the dispassionate lens of her camera. The resulting footage is overlaid with narration reading letters from Akerman’s mother, which are affectionate and chatty but with an undertone of sadness. Combined, they evoke a precise, poignant emotion, the lonely but thrilling sensation of standing on a train platform far from home. —KR It’s bold to make a thriller where the action is predicated on not moving around too much, and even bolder to remake the rare thriller that manages to pull that off (Henri-Georges Clouzot’s “The Wages of Fear”). But in the humid-as-hell “Sorcerer,” William Friedkin’s direction turns the tiniest shifts into the stuff of breathtaking suspense, as two trucks — doubled up to ensure that at least one of them makes the drop-off — packed with highly unstable payloads of nitroglycerin slowly crawl their way through the muddy South American jungle. The roads that lead to these moments are almost as compelling, as Friedkin skillfully introduces the movie’s four criminal protagonists and their reasons for taking this suicidal job. Cynical, sweaty, and set to one of the most transportive film scores ever composed, “Sorcerer” is New Hollywood filmmaking at its finest — even if it took a few decades for Hollywood to realize it. —KR As sublime a full-color epic as has ever been projected onto a movie screen, King Hu’s “A Touch of Zen” was key in introducing the aesthetics and values of Chinese wuxia storytelling to the West. A former Shaw Brothers studio man with an artistic eye and an exacting sense of detail, Hu brought a spiritual dimension to his tales of chivalrous combat that elevated them above their contemporaries. Here, the martial-arts action is secondary: The first real fight scene doesn’t take place until nearly an hour into the picture. But when those scenes do come, they’re nothing short of spectacular — balletic and graceful and edited with an eccentric rhythm that only enhances the magic of skilled performers in motion. —KR Made over an arduous 15 years in which star Meena Kumari’s alcoholism not only regularly derailed filming but ended her marriage to director Kamal Amrohi, “Pakeezah” at last emerged in 1972 as a typically baroque Bollywood melodrama that traces a forbidden romance between a courtesan and her highborn lover down to the next generation of their respective families. Through various twists of fate, the daughter that a wealthy man could not recognize eventually catches the eye of his nephew, repeating a cycle of heartbreak. What separates the film from its peers is the sheer depth of Amrohi’s direction, which often makes up for Kumari’s inconsistent dancing in musical sequences with a heavy use of other performers arrayed in dizzying multi-planar compositions that cross the elaborate blocking of Jacques Tati’s “Playtime” with the most ambitious Indian dance choreography. Rendered in luminous color, “Pakeezah” is like an ornate music box, suspended outside of rationality or even time while conveying an instantly felt emotional directness. —JC Frederick Wiseman’s arc is one of the most important in the history of American documentary film: from a deep skeptic of U.S. institutions, to a fierce defender of them. “Welfare” is one of his greatest achievements because it occupies a kind of middle ground — and points to exactly where America would be headed over the next 50 years. Set in a New York City welfare office, Wiseman’s film paints a portrait of American social assistance as existing in a kind of perpetual defensive posture. It consists almost entirely of deeply suspicious interviews between the welfare office workers and the struggling people they’re ostensibly there to help, as the workers almost never seem to trust the people who’ve come in search of the assistance they need to survive. Each applicant who’s there to talk about a check that got lost in the mail or some other changed circumstance is kept at arm’s length with a verbal 10-foot pole, and subjected to a litany of questions that assume ill intent or ignorance of the office’s practices so profound that they don’t “deserve” help. This is 1975, just 10 years after the establishment of Great Society programs, but the Nixon-Ford push toward defunding these institutions is already underway. You can’t get rid of welfare and Medicaid altogether? Just make certain they’re so underfunded and understaffed they become hollowed out husks, their employees so overworked and undertrained that the people they are meant to help come to hate the very idea of government and are teed up to vote to dismantle it even further in the decades to come. Wiseman’s fly-on-the-wall approach relies upon luck and patience, and he captures lightning in a bottle with a particularly poetic welfare applicant who ends his film with a prophetic summation — not only of his situation, but also of what it says about where America was headed. He suggests that if this country does so little to help its own people — and make no mistake, this is a portrait of welfare as a system of loss and risk mitigation (with policing as a Band-Aid for everything) rather than one actually trying to help people and, you know, encourage a healthier, more productive, less aggrieved society — America would cease to exist by 1988. It’s taken a bit longer than that, but his prediction is clearly in the process of coming true. “Welfare” isn’t only a lucid portrait of the past, it’s also Wiseman’s most prescient vision of the future. —CB Not only the greatest journalism movie ever made, “All the President’s Men” is in some ways the ‘70s movie par excellence, with its combination of an absolute naturalism in its acting and writing — courtesy of an extraordinary script by William Goldman — and a subtle expressionism in the cinematography by Gordon Willis. Goldman made an extraordinary choice: To only adapt the first half of Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward’s book, ending the film with Nixon’s second inauguration in January 1973. It takes some of the melodrama out of the story of Watergate, and puts the focus squarely on the journalistic process. One thing is certain: “All the President’s Men” features the greatest “phone acting” of all time, with extremely lengthy scenes of Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford’s Bernstein and Woodward speaking with source after source to assemble a journalistic puzzle for the ages. In Goldman’s hands, this is dialogue that’s purely procedural, full of pauses and filler words and dead ends (only a little of Bernstein and his girlfriend Nora Ephron’s script rewrite that established Bernstein as “catnip to the ladies,” according to Goldman, made it in), and brought to understated but never less than thrilling dramatic life by director Alan J. Pakula, with Redford overseeing the entire production through his Wildwood Enterprises company. As he had achieved in his previous films of his “Paranoia Trilogy” (“Klute” and “The Parallax View”), Pakula creates a pervasive mood of fear — a fear that had threatened to become the animating force in American life. If anything, it turns out that we weren’t being paranoid enough. —CB Sometimes the smallest conflicts demand the largest canvases. Cinematographer Gordon Willis photographs New York City in black-and-white Panavision widescreen for “Manhattan,” infusing the on-screen metropolis with timeless romantic grandeur. The city’s ineffable beauty lies in tension with the neuroses of Isaac Davis (director and co-writer Woody Allen), a twice-divorced middle-aged comedy writer juggling a relationship with seventeen-year-old high school student Tracy (Mariel Hemingway) and his growing attraction to cerebral journalist Mary (Diane Keaton), who’s having an affair with Isaac’s married best friend Yale (Michael Murphy). While Allen invests himself in the autogenous problems of the cultured class, he often throws them in sharp relief by situating them within the splendor of their urban environment. Manhattan streets become a playground for intellectual gamesmanship and emotional bonding. A conversation about past lovers and contemporary trysts takes place against the transcendental darkness of the Hayden Planetarium. Gramercy Park whizzes by in the background as a desperate man runs to save a doomed romance. They consume the city, but can’t lose themselves in it. Willis’s visual beauty neither elevates nor obscures the self-involved headaches of Allen’s characters. Instead, it envelops them, imbuing them with a cinematic gloss while keeping them firmly relegated to the mortal realm. The quotidian, narcissistic concerns at the heart of “Manhattan”—trying to find love and meaning at all personal costs, forgoing integrity for immediate pleasure, deferring mortality by throwing oneself into art — still comprise the primordial goo of human experience. “You have to have a little faith in people,” Tracy tells Isaac at the end of the film, after he uses her, mostly to torture himself, and then blithely tosses her aside for a shot at Mary, only to regret it the second he’s alone again. The famous line — delivered impeccably by Hemingway, who gives a remarkably unaffected performance that still feels miraculous — prompts a silent, powerfully uncertain reaction from Allen that can be read a million different ways. The cathartic Gershwin score underscores the irony of the moment’s superficially straightforward catharsis: Allen’s film argues people are predictable and disappointing, and that the only faith to be found in them is the consistency of their corruption. What’s left is art, which, of course, is made by people. If life is only worth living because of art, and art exists because of (or maybe in spite of) people, and people are inherently corrupt, then is life worth living? The “unsolvable, terrifying problems of the universe” endure unabated. —VM At his core, Bobby Dupea is a searcher. Restless and irresolute, he’s determined to find purpose in a world that baffles him and amongst people who bore him. Born into an upper-class family of musical prodigies, Bobby rejects the comforts of his upbringing and his considerable artistic talents in favor of a hardscrabble blue-collar life. But it’s clear he doesn’t work on an oil rig or date a waitress with country western aspirations for the progressive optics, or even to alienate his family. His drive for adventure, to negate all semblance of former identity, comes from a sincere, obscure place buried deep in his heart. By 1970, this archetype — the privileged societal drop-out who leaves home to, per Simon and Garfunkel, “look for America” — had amassed some clichés in a post-Summer of Love culture. In the hands of most actors, Bobby Dupea would resemble a collection of affectations instead of a whole human being. But Jack Nicholson is not “most actors,” and thus he imbues the protagonist of Bon Rafelson’s “Five Easy Pieces” with the disordered interiority of a character from literature. He conveys his confused anger and deep-seated sorrow with casual grace, whether he’s trying to contain his uncouth, terminally sweet girlfriend Rayette (a remarkable Karen Black), or manage his barely-concealed contempt around his blue-blooded family, whom he reluctantly agrees to visit in the Pacific Northwest after hearing about his patriarch’s poor health. It’s only the presence of the earnest, grounded Catherine (Susan Anspach), a piano student studying at his family home who’s attracted to Bobby but can’t stomach his apathy, that challenges his hard exterior. The film is defined by an existential melancholy, accented by László Kovács’s painterly photography and conveyed through Nicholson’s performance. In its most famous scene, Bobby patiently confronts a stubborn diner waitress whose strict adherence to the establishment’s “no substitutions” policy has made it impossible for him to order a side of toast. (“You want to hold the chicken salad?” the waitress sneers. “I want you to hold it between your knees,” Bobby famously responds.) Though funny and righteous, the scene’s anti-establishment fervor is tinged with despair. However clever he may be, Bobby just can’t adapt to the customs of a diner, let alone his family or America. He doesn’t get his toast, he doesn’t land the girl he wants or already has, and he doesn’t find purpose. But as the ending indicates, nothing will stop him from trying. —VM Almost certainly the greatest student film ever made, “Eraserhead” was made by a young David Lynch with a budget of $100,000, a series of soundstages and sets owned by the American Film Institute, and a wife and child he was caring for at home. From those humble beginnings, Lynch created something immortal — a stark and enigmatic hallucination that feels untethered to any specific time or place, but continues to endure as a result of its hyper-potent elusiveness. Inspired by his experiences of fatherhood, and his time living with his young family in the Fairmont neighborhood of Philadelphia, Lynch transports “Eraserhead” viewers to an industrial landscape that feels devoid of light and hope, where the hapless hero (Jack Nance, with an iconic shock of frazzled hair) struggles to care for the strange monster his girlfriend gave birth to. With evocative black-and-white photography Frederick Elmes and Herbert Cardwell, along with unnerving sound design from Lynch himself that disorients at every turn, “Eraserhead” is a work of remarkable craft far beyond its modest origins — and a heartbreaking portrait of parental anxiety that will find purchase with a new generation of viewers for as long as movies can still find their cults. —WC Barbara Kopple’s landmark documentary opens with shots of Kentucky coal miners lying flat on a conveyer belt as they slide down the depths of the Brookside Mine, literalizing the pernicious capitalistic notion of human beings as tools. She spends the remainder of the film illustrating the dignity and resolve of those same miners as they strike against the Eastover Coal Company for refusing to honor their union contract with the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA). Kopple’s righteous on-the-ground filmmaking goes within people’s homes and behind picket lines to capture the miners’ effectively confrontational tactics and the unsustainable conditions that made the strike inevitable, including Eastover’s indifference to basic safety standards, which lead to prevalent cases of black lung amongst the laborers, and the Duke Power Company’s record profit increases while worker wages stagnate compared to the cost of living. As “Harlan County, USA” makes clear, Brookside miners were never going to quietly die in squalor without a fight. Kopple leverages the best of vérité techniques to immerse audiences into Harlan County’s social and economic milieu while refusing to strictly adhere to direct cinema orthodoxy. She seamlessly incorporates archival footage, fly-on-the-wall observational footage of union meetings, direct interviews with miners and their wives, and spare use of expositional intertitles to situate viewers in the present-tense moment. Though her primary motivation was to document the struggle, Kopple rarely sacrifices aesthetics in pursuit of that goal. Close-ups of hardened miner faces often speak louder than their words. Transitional montages of poverty-line life soundtracked by folk music illuminate the necessity of labor conflicts in America. A magnificent single take depicts the strikers, who have blocked off a public road leading to the mines, demand the local sheriff deliver an arrest warrant to head gun thug Basil Collins, who sits in a line of cars waiting to threaten the picketers. “Harlan County, USA” typifies the emotional power of worker solidarity exhibited in union meetings and funerals, in demonstrations outside the Duke Power’s North Carolina and on Wall Street. Yet, Kopple is careful not to tip into convenient utopian thinking. As much as the film was created in part to generate a manual for labor organizers, she depicts how hard-fought gains can be just as easily nullified by a divided workforce or ineffectual union leadership. Rhyming with the opening scenes, “Harlan County, USA” closing sequence features miners leaving Brookside mine after another day of drudgery. Kopple’s point is potently unsubtle: as long as people need to work to live, and as long management believes in profits over people, the fight will continue. —VM Unsparing and uncompromising, Martha Coolidge’s debut feature documents its own creation while also re-staging the director’s adolescent rape. Coolidge’s metafictional approach provides the director and her actors — Michele Manenti, who plays Coolidge as a teenager and is herself a sexual assault victim, and Jim Carrington, who plays Coolidge’s attacker — the venue to process trauma without mitigating its horrors. The narrative scenes of a young Martha going on a date from hell and then having to face the judgment of her boarding school dorm-mates never once play like a chintzy after-school special, even as the audience remains constantly aware of their artificial nature. Meanwhile, the fourth-wall-breaking sequences, when Coolidge discusses rape culture and gendered approaches to sexuality with her actors, both of whom bravely commit to the project while also being rattled by the material, startle in their emotional honesty and notable lack of judgment. In the interim 50 years, Americans have become slightly — slightly — more conscious of the prevalence of sexual assault, the importance of consent, and the insidiousness of victim blaming. Yet, “Not a Pretty Picture” never once feels dated in its insights or approach. On the contrary, it feels sadly contemporary. By embracing the constructed unreality of her real-life memory while simultaneously witnessing actors dedicate themselves to its authenticity, Coolidge generates a quietly cathartic experience. “Not a Pretty Picture” never functions like an educational text (though Carrington admits the film could serve that purpose), and Coolidge doesn’t pretend to be in the business of imparting lessons on her actors or her audience. Still, it’s clear that everyone involved comes away affected by the project. Coolidge situates her cast and crew and the audience inside and outside her life-altering experience in order for them to viscerally feel her pain while also intellectually consider it. One of the great debut features of the decade, “Not a Pretty Picture” acutely understands that cinema offers an illusory space, one whose inherently manufactured nature allows memories to be projected and ensnared where they can be experienced without being relived. —VM At a retrospective screening last December, Elaine May clarified that while her downbeat buddy comedy “Mikey and Nicky” does have laughs, they’re “just not the cheery kind.” Inspired by May’s observations of low-level gangsters in Chicago, the film explores male friendship at its most abject, as two lifelong pals — one a maudlin drunk played by John Cassavetes, the other a practical family man embodied by Peter Falk — embark upon an ostensibly freewheeling nighttime journey towards a sobering and inevitable dawn. Misunderstood, like much of May’s work, upon its initial release, “Mikey and Nicky” has seen found its rightful purchase as a classic thanks to May’s incisive screenwriting and the believably desperate performances of her stars. —KR Among everything else you could say about George Lucas’s cinematic cosmic cocktail: Is this simply the most talked about movie of all time? If so, that makes finding something new to offer on the subject a major challenge. And yet, the richness of this work is such that there always seems to be another angle to explore. Like how a camera had never tilted and panned through a starfield before “Star Wars.” Or how the “Mos Eisley Cantina” theme is basically just Dixieland jazz with a little bit of the Charleston added in for good measure. Or the extraordinary narrative choice to just plunge viewers into the middle of the action and leave it to viewers to get their own bearings — there’s never an explanation of what a Jawa is or why they’ve suddenly kidnapped our droid heroes, they just are. You figure it out. That’s Lucas’s soft-spoken invitation to us to explore this galaxy on our own and find our own way around — and millions upon millions formed their own personal connection with “Star Wars” as a result. When you find your own way to something, it’s always a more powerful bond than when it’s imposed on you. Critics always like to point out the way that “Star Wars” stands on the shoulders of Old Hollywood adventure serials like “Flash Gordon,” but as much as Lucas excavated the past, he reinterpreted it too, through his generational post-Vietnam lens. Tunisia doesn’t just replace, say, Monument Valley for a desert landscape, Lucas also has it that the Empire massacres a group of indigenous people early in the film and clumsily tries to hide their murders by pinning it on another indigenous group. Then has the Empire destroy an entire planet, basically just because it can. For as much as it’s a standalone film, “Star Wars” is also a rewarding companion piece to “American Graffiti.” That film is all about a teenager questioning whether he really wants to leave home, about “refusing the call” in Joseph Campbell terms. “Star Wars” is all about what happens after, when you’ve actually left. How you have to find out who you are and what you’re made of, and put together a new family you find along the way. We may not have to take on a Death Star first thing, but the leap that we all have to take in growing up has rarely found a more universal expression than it does in “Star Wars.” —CB Humble Italian peasants living at the end of the 19th century serve as the collective protagonist of Ermanno Olmi’s gorgeously orchestrated, Palme d’Or-winning pastoral saga. Men, women, and children toll away day in and day out on fields that don’t belong to them — all to enrich the wealthy landowner while they struggle to survive on what little they are allowed to keep. Under these precarious circumstances, where every pair of hands is put to use doing manual labor, sending a child to school is a luxury few can afford. One couple decides to spring for it anyway, as the local priest has encourage them to nourish their boy’s God-given intelligence in the hopes that their sacrifice may pay off down the road. But that’s only one story in this boisterous farmhouse of tales. We also a widow trying to support her six children by washing other people’s clothes, and several young people who seek love in a reality where the death of a farm animal — or even something as small as a broken shoe — can test a family’s resilience. And as calamity befalls them, their only solace is the belief that somehow the grace of God will pull them from their desperation. The brilliance of Olmi’s ensemble piece lies in how organically, and unhurriedly, it weaves in and out of each family’s vicissitudes, while also offering glimpses into the unrest that’s brewing beyond the confines of this community. —CA From the poorly designed stunts that brutalized Ellen Burstyn and 14-year-old Linda Blair, to filmmaker William Friedkin’s infamous use of the so-called “practical scare” on set (he reportedly fired real guns at will to keep his actors alert), “The Exorcist” is a cinematic masterpiece — and horrifying in more ways than one. I haven’t even gotten into that mysterious studio fire, yet! The unnerving and electric possession of Regan MacNeil was adapted by screenwriter William Peter Blatty from his 1971 novel. The story, particularly its Georgetown setting, was inspired by a real case of attempted exorcism documented by the Catholic Church in 1948, but Blatty and Friedkin’s influence hung over the 1970s in the shadows of “The Exorcist” and its varied successors. Between works like Richard Donner’s monumental “The Omen” (1976), and John Boorman’s divisive, locus-infested “Exorcist II: The Heretic” (1977), not every cinematic follow-up to “The Exorcist” feels worthy of its association with the Oscar winner for Best Adapted Screenplay. (It also took home Best Sound.) But you could argue the same thing about the countless generically named “Creepy Girl” props you’ll find resembling Blair in haunted decoration stands every Halloween… and who doesn’t love those? Worth making the predictable word choice to call it “head-spinning” at least once, “The Exorcist” begins slow — stewing in the sands of an archaeological dig that unleashes a terror from the pitch-black depths of hell onto a little girl and her woefully screwed mom in D.C. If you don’t know the face of Pazuzu yet, you will have that unholy magic burned into your brain after just one viewing. Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller) tries his best, but decades later, the late actor’s son, who is now a genre filmmaker himself, is still grappling with what happened to the unlucky man on those godforsaken stairs. —AF The opening shot of blaxploitation was significantly more radical than what came after. Multi-hyphenate creator Melvin Van Peebles’ goal with this 1971 firebomb — which came in the wake of his first and only Hollywood production, “The Watermelon Man” — was nothing less than a complete annihilation of conventional cinematic form, as he defied every rule of Hollywood production and editing to create “the first Black Power film” (even going so far as to arm his crew). Bolstered by the support of the Black Panther Party and the tagline, “Rated X by an All-White Jury,” Van Peebles’ missive became a massive box office hit despite — or perhaps because of — its unblinking approach to sex and brutality. Fifty years on, “Sweet Sweetback’s Badasssss Song” is still incendiary, challenging, and one of a kind. —KR An unsparingly nativist satire of colonial arrogance, Nelson Pereira dos Santos’ cinema novo masterpiece remains one of film history’s most cutting rebukes against the white savior narrative that it has done so much to propagate over the last 125 years. Set in 16th century Brazil, the deliciously titled “How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman” stars Arduíno Colassanti as an unnamed settler who’s captured by the indigenous Tupinambás — who believe him to be Portuguese — and told that he will be ritualistically eaten in eight months. It’s not a promising situation for our protagonist, but after being assigned a young wife (Ana Maria Magalhães as Seboipepe) and given free run of her village, our blond “hero” begins to grow comfortable in his new surroundings. He even starts to adopt the local customs and dress (or lack thereof), confident that his captors will come to recognize the savagery of their own customs in the face of his evolved Christian grace. He even appears to fall in love with Seboipepe, and assumes the feeling is mutual. Spoiler alert: There’s a reason why this movie isn’t called “I Didn’t Eat My Husband.” It turns out that Seboipepe is mostly concerned with claiming the best piece of white meat. From its title on down, “How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman” is inflexibly — gleefully — rooted in the perspective of the Tupinambás, whose understanding of the world has been untainted by the hegemony of the European invaders. That ahistorical point-of-view will ultimately lead to their extermination, but not before Pereira dos Santos is able to reverse the time-honored prejudices of Western filmmaking and create a story that identifies with the conquered at all costs. In doing so, he offers a bitingly sardonic reminder that history is easier to swallow than it is to digest. —DE A product of the Direct Cinema movement of observational documentary filmmaking that gave birth to masterpieces like “Grey Gardens” and “Don’t Look Back,” “Gimme Shelter” was born when directors Albert and David Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin were allowed to tag along on the final three weeks of the Rolling Stones’ legendary 1969 tour. What could have been a straightforward rock doc — featuring some impressive behind-the-scenes footage and performances from the legendary band — instead became a chronicle of something far greater when the filmmakers captured the infamous Altamont Free Concert that capped the group’s American leg, complete with footage of the killing of concertgoer Meredith Hunter. Shot with a hazy lens that appropriately feels like an acid trip, “Gimme Shelter” documents all the managerial and organizational failure that allowed the concert to descend into chaos, and the discordant, nightmarish events of the night itself. One of the rawest and most unvarnished non-fiction films of its time period, “Gimme Shelter” is more than a concert doc, its a portrait of a changing era, as the dreams of the ‘60s made way for the cynicism of the ‘70s. —WC Few actors embody everything great about ‘70s cinema better than Gene Hackman. A late bloomer who seemingly stumbled backwards into an acting career, his unvarnished everyman characters were highlights of many of the decade’s best films. And his talents were never put to better use than as Harry R. Caul (a homophonically droll name for a wiretapper), a surveillance expert who falls down a rabbit hole of paranoia after hearing what he believes to be dangerous information that could affect a couple he was hired to spy on. The performance takes a quintessential Hollywood archetype — the washed up man who has long sworn off morality after being haunted by past mistakes — and updates it for a world in which nobody felt like they could trust a word that anyone else was saying. Francis Ford Coppola, in the midst of his all-time great filmmaking run, is at the height of his technical powers, using intricately composed shots of San Francisco and brilliant sound design to illustrate Caul’s mastery of surveillance and his earned distrust in the people who employ him. But the stylization is all grounded in the sad portrait of the character’s life that Coppola and Hackman paint for us. I have personally never attended a surveillance equipment convention, but it’s not hard to imagine how quickly your trust would erode if you spent all of your days hanging out with private sector spies eager to brag about the latest answering machine they broke into. Amid a sea of self-described paranoid thrillers from a very paranoid decade, “The Conversation” stands out among the finest because it managed to meet a national moment without ever having to diverge from its protagonist’s natural truths. —CZ In the films of Jacques Rivette, Paris is less a city than a giant stage or playground upon which characters project imagined dramas, but none of his work takes that idea to a more fantastical extreme than “Duelle.” Here, Juliet Berto and Bulle Ogier’s cryptic femmes fatales are not merely young bohemians roaming around town making up conspiracies and mysteries to add spice to their lives but goddesses in mortal form engaged in a contest of wills that predates human life. As the women gradually orient themselves toward their latest cosmic confrontation, they occupy the rest of their time tempting mortals into their thrall with behaviors heavily indebted to classic noir. In the process, Rivette crafts an impressionistic tribute to everything from Marlene Dietrich’s collaborations with von Sternberg, Weimar-era expressionistic thrillers, even the lucid-dreaming poetic mythology of Jean Cocteau. Eschewing mere homage for a sublimation of past forms into something new, “Duelle” reconfigures the cinephilia of the Cahiers critic-filmmakers into a vision of cinema as timeless as the oldest myths of the ancient world. —JC Clint Eastwood was already the star and director of numerous westerns by the time he made “The Outlaw Josey Wales,” but it was here he fully emerged from the shadows of early collaborators Sergio Leone and Don Siegel to establish himself as the true heir to John Ford’s vision of the West. Physically and psychologically scarred by the Civil War, Eastwood’s Josey is a vision of rage so uncontrollable that the massacre of surrendering comrades by Union troops seems more a convenient excuse for inevitable bloodshed than justifiable cause. As in “The Searchers,” the film gradually pulls its protagonist back from the edge of damnation, but where Ford’s movie offers moral clarity at the last possible second, Eastwood’s confronts its hero’s anger throughout the story. As Josey assembles a makeshift caravan of Native Americans, harassed homesteaders, and other unfortunate souls, Eastwood draws constant but understated attention to the contrast between the Confederate’s aggrievement and the larger framework of racial, gender, and class violence in America. Slowly but surely, this wrathful Lost Cause thriller morphs into an unsentimental but nonetheless hopeful vision of community solidarity as the only true defense against the predations of individuals and systems. —JC Winner of the Palme d’Or at Cannes in 1975, and still the only African film to have ever been awarded that prize, “Chronicles of the Years of Fire” is both a political epic and a personal account of Algeria’s struggle for independence. Director Mohammed Lakhdar-Hamina stages the story with large-scale set pieces, poetic monologues, and sweeping cinematography. Crucially, however, he avoids triumphalism at every turn. Instead, his film traces how colonial violence reshaped everyday life and made revolt inevitable. It’s long, demanding, and often theatrical, but always urgent. Few African films have matched its scale, and even fewer have carried this kind of historical weight on the world stage. —TO Shudder’s “Dario Argento Panico” is an essential documentary primer for any cinephile just getting into the complex, supersaturated legacy of Italy’s most notorious genre filmmaker. Understanding the dark psychology of a man who conjured up unfathomable suspense and horror — then repeatedly cast his real wife and kids as exquisite centerpieces in those artful nightmares — is, how do you say, “tutta una cosa.” That’s Italian for “a whole thing,” and basically the entire point for dedicated fans of the director. Effectively standing in for a decade of brilliant giallo on this list, “Suspiria” is more than up to the task. The eerie magic Argento first conjured up in 1977 is best remembered for its illustrious use of color, even with “Deep Red” right there in the director’s filmography. The crimson splatters and jewel-colored glass that adorn the German ballet school where “Suspiria” takes place make it a crowning achievement in the pantheon of visual horror. That masterful dreamscape is reflected in the eyes of a young American dancer, Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper), whose serpentine descent into supernatural madness plays out like a lethal recital on psychedelics. Loosely translated, “Suspiria” means “breathing” or “to take a deep breath.” That quietly sensual undercurrent might explain why “Challengers” director Luca Guadagnino and “50 Shades” muse Dakota Johnson teamed up to revive Argento’s classic as a high-concept art film with a well-disguised Tilda Swinton in the critically-acclaimed remake from 2018. The original can’t evoke quite the same visceral response as that film’s updated effects, but anyone whose seen the atrium-hanging sequence should be able to convince you to watch both versions. Trite but true, there’s more than one way for a witch to step on your neck. —AF One of the final films by the great Luis Buñuel, “The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoise” moves from dinner party to dinner party in a disorienting haze, each moment bleeding into the next. True to its title, the cast of characters we follow are a group of six well-off French men and women, each containing a sense of smug satisfaction and an underlying restlessness in their comfortable, mannered lives. Their attempts to dine together are thwarted by a series of vignettes both “real” and dreamed, from terrorist attacks to ghostly encounters to the discovery that their lives are actually a stage play. Buñuel’s comedy is dry as a bone, with each absurdity readily accepted by the passive ensemble. The film pokes and prods them mercilessly, with each mishap peeling away at the fundamental spiritual rot within them. It’s that unflinching meanness towards its own characters that makes “The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoise” one of the great satires in all of film history. —WC So much of Ingmar Bergman’s work was defined by the women who brought his intimate, existential dramas to life, and with whom he frequently had tempestuous romances off-screen. Kicking off an impressive late-period run from the Swedish auteur before his retirement in 1982, “Cries and Whispers,” gives one of his first muses — Harriet Andersson — a harrowing showcase that doubles as a reflection on how much time has passed since she was the ingenue launched to stardom by Bergman’s “Summer With Monika.” In this austere psychological tragedy, Andersson plays a noblewoman tucked away in a country manor dying slowly from disease, with two sisters (Liv Ullmann and Ingrid Thulin) who are distant to both her and each other. As flashbacks reveal the cruelties that curdled this family, Bergman and cinematographer Sven Nykvist bathe the film in a stark red glow, bringing fire to an icy, despairing work. And Andersson is devastating as the frail woman at the center, giving her last leading performance for the director whom her career was forever intertwined. —WC Glowing and electric, George A. Romero’s masterful “Night of the Living Dead” (1968) is iconic for a reason. But the sequel that followed his feature debut a decade later, “Dawn of the Dead” (1978), lies at the heart of a truly beloved filmography. Despite studio interference and a lack of financial stability throughout his otherwise successful artistic life, Romero is remembered as the sensitive American filmmaker whose steadfast commitment to the underdog gave the cinematic undead their reputation for social consciousness. At their most memorable, scary movies have long reflected how we can do better as people — alone or en masse. Created after several years of its director exploring other less terrifying realms, Romero’s genre homecoming endures as a remarkable collaboration between him, co-producer Dario Argento, the musical group known as the Band Goblin (credited in the film as The Goblins), and special effects wizard Tom Savini. The strongest and most ghoulish worship comes from community, and the action, comedy, and horror film worlds socialize as much as the artists here. Set inside a shopping mall, “Dawn of the Dead” sees combat collide with corpses as the zombie apocalypse from the first movie blooms into a bigger production for Romero. This nightmare is more philosophically complex, too. (Not like “Day of the Dead” levels of enlightenment, but you know, within reason.) Romero’s script masterfully disassembles the concept of a literal safe house under capitalism to explore the complacency it breeds, and to suggest that even the bravest leaders among us won’t know to burn it all down until it’s too late. —AF Med Hondo’s 1979 epic is so compelling that merely describing it is sufficient justification for its inclusion on this list. Filmed aboard a reconstructed slave ship inside an abandoned French factory, with a budget totalling $1.35 million (making it the most expensive African film ever at the time), “West Indies” is a musical satire/non-linear historiography of French colonialism. It is a whirlwind of post-Fanon interpolations with an unsparing, furious clarity of purpose. Hondo paints the history of the Caribbean under French rule as one where revolution is co-opted by capitalism, where artistic expression is disallowed without sufficient cultural assimilation, and where violence and displacement persist under the guise of progress. All of this might have amounted to little more than a politically astute curio were it not for Hondo’s total command of Western spectacle. “West Indies” has some of the greatest musical numbers ever filmed, with a dizzying sense of scale, intricacy, and imagination. Hondo plainly outdoes many of the pop artists he satirizes. The result is a blisteringly intelligent referendum on the rotten core of Euro-American cinema, and an equally potent tribute to the resilient fullness of African cultures. —SB The money alone is notable: Made for less than $9 million, “Jaws” went on to make over $470 million in global returns, including a $260 million domestic take that earned it the top spot at the box office in 1975. The film toppled other high-powered hits like “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” and “Dog Day Afternoon,” all huge moneymakers that were decidedly non-blockbuster in nature. And “Jaws” was the first feature film to break $235 million in domestic returns. Steven Spielberg’s big hit — his first, and obviously not his last — paved the way for the massive tentpole features that now dominate the summer season, huge earners that capture both the zeitgeist and hefty audiences. The secret? It’s one that filmmakers of any generation can stand to learn, remember, and take to heart: the film is good. So many blockbusters not only eschew overall quality in service to whiz-bang entertainment and speedy fun, but they do it with truly disposal amusements. Nothing about “Jaws” is throwaway. Meticulously built from stem to stern, “Jaws” takes pains to steep us in the world of small-town Amity (it means friendship!) long before a seriously large and biblically pissed off shark makes mincemeat of many of its citizens and everyone’s nerves. Neatly divided into two distinct sections – a landlubbing first half that tracks a small town on the edge, none of it helped by a mayor who doesn’t really see a need to mess with holiday fun, no matter how many people die, followed by an alternately claustrophobic and just kinda fun death sail on the high seas — “Jaws” builds both its tension and character evolution with steady hands. While we may briefly wonder who is going to beat this thing – Ocean-adverse chief of police Martin Brody (Roy Scheider)? Grizzled fisherman and battered war hero Quint (Robert Shaw)? Know-it-all wino marine biologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss)? – the real question is, who is going to survive and what the hell does that even look like? Luckily for us, “Jaws” itself endures. —KE Jacques Rivette’s prankish, exuberant, and restlessly energetic “Céline and Julie Go Boating” boasts one of the all-time great cinematic friendships. It’s also a total explosion of the rules of cinematic storytelling, and one of the most innovative features of the 1970s — no small feat. Dominique Labourier plays Julie, a reverie-prone librarian who meets Céline (Juliet Berto) in a sequence straight out of Lewis Carroll, as Céline keeps dropping objects that Julie can’t chase her down fast enough to return. That sets the stage for an enchanting, but never precious or twee, tale of doubles… in addition to a love triangle, a mysterious house, and a subplot about a psychedelic candy that allows the two women — who become fast friends and roommates after that chance meeting — to seemingly bend the rules of time altogether. Here’s where Rivette tosses yet another genre, the murder mystery melodrama, into “Céline and Julie” in ways that gleefully reinvent the very references he’s trying to make and then subvert. “Céline and Julie Go Boating” feels in many ways like the original hangout movie of the 1970s, bouncing along episodically, more jaunty picaresque than manic pixie dream girl omnibus. Despite running nearly three-and-a-half hours, this allusion-heavy (and illusion-heavy) movie is made totally accessible by Rivette’s disorienting and tradition-disrupting style. More than that, it feels like a fresh discovery each time you rewatch it. —RL “Everything begins and ends at the exactly right time and place,” says an Australian schoolgirl with dead eyes and a breathy, bated voice at a pivotal moment in Peter Weir’s lastingly elusive “Picnic at Hanging Rock.” Ushering in a New Wave of Australian 1970s cinema that put the country’s film scene on the global map, Weir’s masterpiece remains equally influential for contemporary filmmakers such as Sofia Coppola, who picked up Weir’s mantle as the cinema’s reigning master of dazed blonde women strung out on fainting couches. Like patterns in the clouds, you can read almost anything into the bottomless pit of mystery that becomes the center of this unforgettably strange portrait of sexual repression, written by screenwriter Cliff Green. It’s Valentine’s Day, 1900, at the fictional all-girls boarding school called Appleyard College, where a group of students head out toward a geological formation, Hanging Rock, in Victoria. Three vanish without a trace, seemingly into a crevice in the formation. The sighting of a strange red cloud that coincided with the three young women’s seeming evaporation into nowhere, as told by Edith (Christine Schuler), could be read as a limpid, subtle-as-a-chainsaw metaphor for looming femininity and the disappearances themselves as the loss of innocence into adulthood. More memorable than its symbolism, however, is the seductive, ethereal, and dread-spiked atmosphere “Picnic at Hanging Rock” conjures, leaving you in as dazed a spell as the protagonists whose dilemma remains stubbornly unsolved. That’s where Weir’s chillingly directed film gets its extraordinary power. —RL Banned after the 1979 Iranian Revolution and thought lost for decades, Mohammad Reza Aslani’s miraculous “Chess of the Wind” wasn’t widely seen until its 2020 restoration, when it arrived with the feeling of a priceless discovery. Set almost entirely inside a decaying aristocratic mansion in early 20th century Tehran, the film is a tightly controlled chamber drama about inheritance and control. A paralyzed woman battles her stepfamily for power, while servants lurk and loyalties shift in silence. The stillness is deceptive; every movement, glance, and sound is loaded with meaning. Its surface recalls the visual grammar of 1970s festival auteurs, but Aslani builds a world anchored in the historical textures of Iranian society, shaped by class conflict, gendered power, and a quiet subversion of patriarchy. Its formal control and long absence make it one of the most arresting rediscoveries in recent world cinema history. —TO The fate of the midnight movie is still pretty much at the mercy of kids who can’t decide if they should cancel each other for liking “The Rocky Horror Picture Show.” But Brian de Palma’s “Phantom of the Paradise” reigns supreme as the definitive best piece of flashy genre cinema from the 1970s — a glorious ode to a rocker punished for his passion that was itself tortured on its rocky road to theaters. Thanks to a nonsensical legal challenge from Led Zeppelin, moviegoers have to be pretty lucky to catch De Palma’s extraordinary 1974 glam opera as it was meant to be seen. Censorship plagues all publicly available versions of the film, and a particularly egregious restoration from a physical media release a few years ago left many fans disturbed by the intricate production details lost to its poorly updated color. Still, whichever version you watch, the tragic tale of musical genius Winslow Leach (William Finley) shines through as a timeless testament to the power of talented freaks with a song to sing. Paul Williams scored “Phantom of the Paradise,” which also casts the Grammy-winning composer as the villainous namesake executive for Swan Records. Swan destroys what could be a quick rise to fame for Winslow and his band, The Juicy Fruits, when he steals the basis for their first hit song. Enter Beef (Gerrit Graham), a competitive diva whose effort to help Swan screw over Winslow ends explosively. The glittery terror that surrounds that reveal commingles bejeweled platforms and fishnets (with some of the more disturbing elements of the Gypsy Rose Blanchard story?) in a singular “Phantom of the Opera” homage. It also sees “Suspiria” final girl Jessica Harper centerstage as its fresh-faced Angel of Music in a performance that could almost make you forget the movies’ later attempts at creating their own Christine. —AF Dripping with style and sick with unease in its portrait of an emotionally detached man (Jean Louis-Trintignant) hired to assassinate his ex-fascist former professor, Bernardo Bertolucci’s “The Conformist” illuminates its protagonist’s psyche with a scintillating dance of light and shadow — an approach that would have an enormous influence on Francis Ford Coppola as he ramped up to make “The Godfather.” Shooting in Rome and Paris as well as Cinecittà Studios in Italy, production designer Ferdinando Scarfiotti and cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (unjustly robbed of an Oscar nomination for his hugely influential work here) summoned the vibes of 1930s Fascist Italy with extraordinary detail, emboldened by Bertolucci’s baroque style. At the center of this cold — but never bloodless — movie is the relationship between Marcello (Trintignant) and Anna (Dominique Sanda), the professor’s wife whom he falls in love with fatal consequences. Those consequences are realized in a disturbing and suspenseful sequence that elegantly summarizes the movie’s themes of cowardice, repression, betrayal, offering an ultimate reminder of Marcello’s own fecklessness. Antiheroes became a dominant trademark of 1970s cinema both abroad and in the United States; look toward the moral complexities of Marcello for an early figurehead of that trope, all wrapped up in a doom-laden but ecstatically glorious movie. —RL A three-part nonfiction epic, Patricio Guzman’s black-and-white masterpiece is unrivaled as the premier filmic document preserving the memory of Chile before, during, and after one of its most troubled chapters, which has defined its modern history. Starting in the months before military dictator Augusto Pinochet came to power by force, Guzman set his camera against a country in crisis. The first installment, 1975’s “The Insurrection of the Bourgeoisie,” hinges on the director’s interviews with working class people as they take to the streets to demonstrate in defense of Salvador Allende’s government, and to denounce how the elite has fought to maintain their privileged position at the expense of the masses. On the ground amid the turmoil, “The Coup d’état” goes on to bear witness to violent clashes, hopeful protests, ardent speeches, and ultimately to the U.S.-backed overthrow of Allende on September 11, 1973, which ushered in a dark period for the South American nation. The final part, “Popular Power,” winds back the clock to serve as something of a prequel, as Guzman explores the proletariat’s frustrated attempts at reclaiming their power. Although forced into exile for decades, the acclaimed filmmaker has since continued to observe Chile’s transformation over the years, and to investigate his own complicated relationship with the country of his birth in several subsequent works (including 1997’s “Chile, Obstinate Memory,” which found Guzman screening his trilogy for Chileans who had never seen it before). But none of those later projects, strong as they are, can hope to match the potency of watching history change from within the eye of the storm. —CA It’s impossible to study “Apocalypse Now” in a vacuum, as the film’s legacy will always be defined by the history surrounding it: the famously harrowing shoot that pushed Francis Ford Coppola to his limits and inspired the excellent documentary “Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker’s Apocalypse,” the dramatic Cannes premiere where Coppola’s massive bet paid off with a Palme d’Or win, and the director’s insistence to continue revising it into the 21st century. But even without succumbing to the crass temptation to use filmmaking as a metaphor for war, time and distance have proved that the chaos underscoring “Apocalypse Now” have only strengthened its legacy. The most appropriately pessimistic film by one of America’s greatest optimists, it’s now easy to see “Apocalypse Now” as the end of the New Hollywood era. That has far more to do with correlation than causation, but it’s also symbolically fitting: After a decade of watching the industry release auteur-driven films about the gaping hole that the Vietnam War left in America society, Coppola tackled the war that lurked over the decade’s other masterpieces so directly that it’s hard to shake the feeling that filmmakers moved on because there was nothing left to say. It would be impossible to determine exactly how much of the film’s chaos was pre-planned, and how much emerged naturally from a shoot so grueling shoot that it seemed as if God was determined to punish the auteur for his ambition. But Coppola’s vision resonated for a reason, and the pairing of his prescient foresight — about how the military would evolve in a direction of specialization that allows for even greater brutality — and the lucid observation that war brings out sides of men that they’re not capable of looking in the mirror proved to be a lethal combo. “Apocalypse Now” is New Hollywood radicalism executed on a scale that few of his peers ever received a chance to try. It’s a coda to two eras of American history, one artistic and one historical, and remains the definitive portrayal of a war that defined a generation. —CZ This isn’t to say that Hollis Frampton’s “(nostalgia)” is necessarily the greatest experimental film of the 1970s (competition for that useless title abounds, even from the other chapters of the artist’s “Hapax Legomena” film cycle), but rather to argue that it might be the most productive experimental film of the 1970s to put on a commercial-oriented list such as this one. Epitomizing the “structural” cinema movement that Frampton rejected as a coherent framework, “(nostalgia”) is a singularly potent gateway drug to another universe of moviemaking — one in which the shape of a film can be the ultimate expression of its content. To watch “(nostalgia”) is to discover, reconnect with, or simply exalt in the idea that there is something inherently profound, and in this case also extremely poignant, to the materials and construction of cinema itself. Here, the materials are simple, their construction is plain, and the deep well of feeling that Frampton conjures between them is raw, lucid, and inviting. Thirty-eight minutes. Thirteen photographs. One electric burner. A formative picture from the early days of the filmmaker’s career is placed on a hot plate, where it disintegrates in the flames as a plainspoken voice — speaking in the first person, but in fact belonging to avant-garde legend Michael Snow — discusses the image in the context of Frampton’s life. The images are evocatively unremarkable, the narration diaristic yet vaguely wounded. Old friends. Half-forgotten places. A pair of toilets sitting next to each other. Before long, the viewer begins to notice a glitch in the matrix: The narration isn’t describing the picture on screen, it’s describing the next picture to come. The effect is as temporally destabilizing as being ambushed by the smell of your childhood home: We’re hearing about a photograph we haven’t seen yet, and looking at a photograph we’ve already heard described. That basic misalignment is enough to create a strange and movingly porous middle ground in the space between anticipation and memory, as the pain of reflecting upon the past is dimensionalized by the natural human impulse to cast ourselves forwards into the future. Time eventually reduces it all to ash and silence, but not before Frampton is able to glimpse a fleeting truth of some kind in the movie’s dying seconds — a nowness that no other medium can give us. “Here it is. Look at it! Do you see what I see?” “(nostalgia)” is an invitation to never stop looking. —DE Has any director ever cared more about how a movie “feels” than Robert Altman with “McCabe & Mrs. Miller”? The film evokes wintry rain and snow and the puffs of dry heat from a pot-belly stove so well you almost feel like you can see Altman’s breath fogging up the camera lens. One of the greatest of all “winter Westerns,” this parable about commerce — and the role that affection and jealousy and violence play in the holding it all together — is an inimitable, oil-lamp-lit gaze into the past that also reflects the light of an eternal present at the same time. Warren Beatty wears a bear-skin coat so thick it makes you warm just to look at it. And he in turn warms the hopes of a small Pacific Northwest logging town with his card-playing skills, rictus grin, and declaration that he’s a “businessman.” Partnering with a veteran madam in Julie Christie, they open a brothel for the town, the one hope for salvation from the grim reality of the everyday — especially since the long-awaited Presbyterian Church is never quite finished. If transcendence isn’t possible, being a sinner can be the best way to endure capitalism. It sure encourages everyone to give it a shot. Pitched between a grimed-up materialism and dreamy aspirations — epitomized to perfection by the Leonard Cohen songs Altman put on the soundtrack with lyrics like “I’m just a Joseph looking for a manger” — “McCabe & Mrs. Miller” is the greatest kind of period piece: One that isn’t an escape into the past, but a way to better understand how we arrived at the present. —CB Shot over a series of weekends in South Central Los Angeles, Charles Burnett’s “Killer of Sheep” remains one of the most quietly profound films in all of American cinema. With nonprofessional actors and a focus on everyday detail, it follows a slaughterhouse worker weighed down by routine and fatigue. There is no clear plot, just fragments of life, captured with care and restraint — every one of its images feels etched in stone but fully alive at the same time. Burnett, a key figure in the L.A. Rebellion, made a film about Black working-class life without any trace of sentiment or spectacle. Its 2007 restoration brought overdue attention, but the film has always carried the same lucid clarity and profound emotional weight. —TO Screenwriter Paul Schrader’s compulsion towards male isolation, modern disaffect, and the pursuit of transcendence that promises to alleviate them both has never been more potent than it remains in his original masterpiece. Each of the film’s unimaginably bold swings lands cleanly because the script does all of the little things right. As so many have pointed out, the appalling choice to make Jodie Foster’s Iris Steensma a literal child prostitute at just 12-years-old was the only way to create a moral travesty so utterly black-and-white that it could push a morally ambivalent man to forfeit his life for a cause. That transition from fringe observer to self-defined martyr unfolds with perfect cyclicality, affording Travis Bickle a Hero’s Journey within his own head without giving us any reason to believe that we’re leaving him any better off. “Taxi Driver” is in many ways the quintessential New Hollywood film, and so much ink has been spilled about what that means — from its unapologetic portrayal of post-Vietnam bitterness to its refusal to fully cut ties with the classic storytelling traditions of “The Searchers” — that blurbing Martin Scorsese’s most sordid masterpiece seems like a waste of bandwidth. But faced with the gravity of a true masterpiece, perhaps the most radical thing we can do is look at all the misinterpretations and cheap knock-offs it inspired and sincerely conclude that it was all still worth it to get the movie we did. It’s hard to think of a higher compliment to give a film than “You’re the reason we got two ‘Joker’ movies, and yet the world is still undeniably richer for your existence.” —CZ Paris in the daytime has never felt as desolate as it does in Jean Eustache’s 220-minute relationship drama. Presenting the collapse of May ‘68 as the intellectual equivalent of Paris’s fall to the Nazis, the film depicts the city as an eerily barren metropolis populated only by small groups of emotionally atomized citizens each absorbed in their own diversions and work. No one embodies this retreat into solipsism better than Alexandre (Jean-Pierre Léaud), a student leftist turned reactionary in the wake of the progressive movement’s collapse at the end of the ‘60s. Ranting and raving about the failures of permissive society and the loss of traditional values, Alexandre nonetheless pursues two women he wants only for sex. Eustache’s film is an unsparing, eternally relevant overview of the manner in which jilted leftists can retreat into conservatism. The director even puts the ostensible progressivism of the French New Wave under a microscope, pointedly casting Nouvelle Vague poster child Léaud and positioning his character’s unchecked cinephilia as just one form of his fetishization of the past. But the filmmaker also depicts ongoing resistance of a kind, as the gradually forming bond between Veronika and Marie offers a refusal to submit to Alexandre’s attempted reassertion of chauvinist power — and a determination to retain the breakthroughs of the prior decade. —JC The most sinister and dreamlike of ’70s paranoid thrillers (its elusive sense of evil born from the unfinished state of David Giler and Lorenzo Semple Jr.’s script, the sociopathic disaffectedness of Gordon Willis’ cinematography, and the two-note twinkle of Michael Small’s synth score), Alan J. Pakula’s “The Parallax View” is a film born from the creeping unease that settled into American life as the country’s post-war idealism began to seem like the ultimate cover-up. It’s a cover-up that Warren Beatty’s guilt-ridden journalist is determined to uncover, and — in the wake of surviving a yacht explosion and foiling a bomb threat to a commercial airplane — it almost seems as if he might be able to expose the plot to assassinate the most progressive senators who popped up after Kennedy was gunned down. If only a thick feather cut and a dream were enough to set the world to rights. No such luck for the fearless Joe Frady, who finds himself at the center of a plot in which heroes are little more than handsome patsies, and villains hardly seem to have faces at all. Staged with hypnotic impassivity from the moment it starts (the spectacular opening sequence atop the Seattle Space Needle all the more impactful for its casual disregard), “The Parallax View” puts forward a much smarter and more calculated vision of a deep state conspiracy than the one we got. All the same, its closed-loop concept of American entropy — and its unnerving insistence that the truth can kill you without fully revealing itself — continues to resonate on a much darker wavelength than any of Pakula’s other ’70s classics. —DE First released 50 years ago, after Francoist censors convinced themselves that its anti-authoritarian messaging would have little social impact if buried under such a “boring” art film, Victor Erice’s “The Spirit of the Beehive” follows a gullible six-year-old girl named Ana (Ana Torrent), who sees a screening of “Frankenstein” when a mobile cinema arrives in the small Castilian village where she lives with her family in the Spanish Civil War’s immediate aftermath. Confused and horrified by the sight of Frankenstein’s monster accidentally killing a child, and the townspeople then killing Frankenstein’s monster in return, Ana’s elder sister tells her that neither of those things actually happened — that everything you see in films is fake. Later, with the memories of James Whale’s movie still fresh in her mind, Ana discovers a wounded republican soldier hiding in a sheepfold and decides to treat him with kindness instead of fear. It makes no difference to his ultimate fate. Ana’s sister was only half right in the end: “Frankenstein” may be a work of fiction, but fiction isn’t the same thing as “fake.” Erice has only made three other features since his spellbinding debut, but all have been set in the same liminal space between film and reality that he explored in his first. As beguiling and hard to shake as any movie ever made (just ask Guillermo del Toro), “The Spirit of the Beehive” sinks so deeply under the skin for its ability to fulfill cinema — and “Frankenstein”’s — promise of eternal return; its capacity as a magic trick capable of keeping the past alive long after it’s already died within us. The movies are real, Erice has always insisted. This one allows you to see that clearly. —DE As unforgivable as it is to reduce an Andrei Tarkovsky film to a 1:1 allegory for a specific current event, it’s hard to watch “Solaris” these days without feeling like it was made for 2025. It was probably made for quite a few other years too (many of which haven’t happened yet), but watching AI-generated recreations of deceased crime victims give interviews on talk shows and statements in courtrooms is a convenient reminder that Tarkovsky’s wisdom was ahead of its time.No other science-fiction film has ever been so bold in its assertion that science as a vocation isn’t all that great. “Solaris” begins with the scientific community doubting each other’s testimony to the point where they send a psychiatrist into space to audit — and potentially shut down — a research mission. When the cosmonaut makes it to the space station, he discovers that the crew’s unsupervised observation of the strange magnetic fields surrounding the ocean planet Solaris have driven one person to suicide and caused dangerous hallucinations among everyone else. And yet, despite being armed with all of the prior knowledge that nothing he sees on the ship will be real, our hero is powerless to resist a vision of his dead wife, which is is enough to make him abandon his scientific principles for a cheap facsimile of someone he once loved. It’s a moment of intellectual weakness and a major lapse in professional judgement, but anyone who says they’d act differently is lying to themselves. Tarkovsky mines the tension between the lofty ideas that guide science and the fallen nature of the humans who try to pursue them, and this sprawling, highly symbolic film is rife with many of the ideas that fascinated him throughout his entire career: that there are secrets in the world that humans aren’t meant to understand, that we’re fools to try and analyze things that should only be experienced spiritually, and that esoteric quests for metaphysical meaning are only undertaken by broken people with nothing better to do. Looking out the window towards a society that appears increasingly convinced to invent the technologies that will burn it to the ground simply because we have the technology to do so, we’d all be well-served to remember one of the film’s most profound quotes: “We’re in the foolish human predicament of striving for a goal he fears, that he has no need for.” —CZ “Days of Heaven” is a gem that has only grown more luminous with time. Filmmaker Terrence Malick was then still an emerging voice, now he’s viewed as one of American cinema’s most singular auteurs. After making his debut with 1973’s “Badlands,” Malick returned five years later with a film that’s as visually arresting as it is narratively elusive. Shot largely during the vaunted “magic hour” and steeped in natural light, “Days of Heaven” emerged from a notoriously difficult post-production process. The footage took two years to shape into a cohesive narrative, but the final product earned critical acclaim — and four Oscar nominations, including a win for Néstor Almendros’ haunting cinematography. Nearly five decades on — and with films like “The Thin Red Line” and “The Tree of Life” only expanding his mythos — Malick’s sophomore effort is seen not only as a foundational text in his body of work, but as one of the defining films of the ’70s. Its reputation rests not just on its painterly visuals, but on the dreamlike way it tells its deceptively simple tale. Richard Gere stars as Bill, a drifter who convinces his girlfriend Abby (Brooke Adams) to pose as his sister so she can marry a dying farmer (Sam Shepard) for his land. Linda Manz, who also provides the film’s ethereal voiceover, plays Bill’s actual sister, tagging along as the trio’s fragile arrangement begins to unravel. Like “Badlands,” “Days of Heaven” is remarkably lean. Despite the drawn-out editing process, the film clocks in at just 94 minutes — a rarity in Malick’s later, more sprawling work. Within that brief running time, he crafts something hypnotic, lyrical, and emotionally resonant. The film’s centerpiece — a literal blaze of glory on a wheat farm — remains one of the most indelible images in American cinema. —RC An exploitation film released in 1974 with a title as shocking and to-the-point as “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” was never going to struggle to earn back its $140,000 budget, but that didn’t stop Tobe Hooper from reaching for the moon and tearing an irreparable cosmic rift in horror cinema. Stripped of the artificiality that tended to soften the genre, Hooper’s unvarnished masterpiece subjected moviegoers to some of the most nauseating imagery ever captured on film without so much as a moment to take a breath. The practical effects and the barbarity of the tool-powered killings hold up to this day, but it’s because of the film’s deceptively sophisticated pathos that it’s so entrenched itself in our collective psyche. Leatherface isn’t motivated by the kind of malice or revenge that drive so many other horror villains — he’s a mentally disabled man raised by a perverse family with no means of supporting him after their jobs at the slaughterhouse disappeared. Forgotten by a society that was already beginning to rot, his family’s brutal actions were underscored by the notion that something similar could be lurking at the end of any innocuous-seeming country road.The scariest part of “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” is its utter nihilism. Hooper’s film remains so unsettling because of how blatantly it rejects the binary of good guys and bad, binary, offering us all a hideous reminder that we’re all just animals who are capable of inflicting unimaginable evils on each other once the paper-thin norms separating us from our instincts start to crumble. —CZ It’s all bad vibes and dark times in Nicolas Roeg’s hugely upsetting, weirdly tender, not quite sexy but surprisingly carnal study of mourning, “Don’t Look Now.” Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland bare it all and so much more as a WASP and a British Protestant who stare into the abyss of the absolute worst thing that could happen to any two parents — their daughter drowning in the shallowest of ponds, right outside their own English countryside home. Where most contemporary horror movies that center on grieving couples (i.e. “Antichrist,” which blurs Roeg into Tarkovsky) tend to fling them to, say, a remote cabin in the woods as a backdrop for healing, “Don’t Look Now” instead sends its grief-dazed protagonists to the crowded canals of Venice, Italy. It’s there that Sutherland’s character, John Baxter, has agreed to restore an ancient church, hauling Laura —who seems almost suspiciously emotionally blinkered given recent events — along with him. But the city’s rabbit-warren corridors, as established in Daphne du Maurier’s source novel, become M.C. Escher-esque grief portals as Laura becomes obsessed with a pair of supposedly psychic geriatric sisters. Meanwhile, there is a small person with a red hood — the very one the Baxters’ daughter wore the day she died — running around the city. “Don’t Look Now” is most infamous for a sex scene nested within Roeg’s trademark style of cross-cutting, in which two events in parallel yet discrete timelines appear to be happening at once. John and Laura are both dressing and undressing, fucking and then not fucking, with armpit-licking and cunnilingus that shocked audiences and censorship boards and by present day standards certainly isn’t prude. But what it wasn’t, and isn’t, is gratuitous. On the contrary, it situates “Don’t Look Now” as more emotionally raw-nerved romantic drama than true horror movie. Though you can’t forget the climax, which is one of the greatest of all cinematic rug-pulls, made all the more incredible by the fact that Roeg got away with it. This is the original “elevated horror”: knockout performances, skillful craft, and a director who undersides the dual sides of manipulating and cajoling actors and who can elevate schlocky material. —RL According to Elia Kazan, Barbara Loden’s last words — which she furiously spoke on her deathbed as her body gave out from breast cancer — were, “Shit, shit, shit.” Throughout their professional collaboration and marriage, the director — who cast actress-turned-filmmaker Loden in “Splendor in the Grass” — allegedly tried to undercut her autonomy and dismissed her creative ambitions. But the ambition of a woman operating below the studio system and out from her ex-husband’s eye paved the way for Loden’s “Wanda,” a troubling, often grimly hilarious and Cassavetes-adjacent landmark in the history of independent film. Played by Loden herself, Wanda is as apathetic as any woman as we’ve seen onscreen, languishing through life amid a pile-up of disappointments: She’s left her husband, granting him full custody of their children, and doesn’t protest when it’s time to sign the divorce papers. Loden, who had two children with Kazan, modeled the character after a version of herself: wandering, adrift, between jobs and between men, wedding her autobiography to a thinly sketched bank robbery plot that’s more background noise than the thrust of this existential tone poem of a 16mm-shot movie. One of the wisest, most piercingly drawn scenes in “Wanda” finds the heroine idling through a shopping mall, matching eyes with mannequins that both reflect her own soul-drained blankness and the status divided between her dreams and achievements, these life-sized “human” models adorned in clothes she could never afford. Here is one of the great portraits of a woman trying to find a place in the world, her world; she doesn’t find it by the end of the film, but the largesse of strangers (for food, for conversation, for cigarettes, for companionship) is enough carry her through another day. —RL In a pivotal decade of Hindi cinema, one film towers above the rest: “Sholay.” Ramesh Sippy’s 1975 Western, penned by Salim-Javed, was initially panned and pegged as a flop, but a stark turn in fortune would soon put it on its path to legend. Amitabh Bachchan and Dharmendra star as Jai and Veeru, two petty criminals hired by former inspector Thakur (Sanjeev Kumar) to catch the deadly bandit Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan) — alive. The duo’s friendship is the emotional core of a film filled with love, loss, and vengeance, with supporting performances by Hema Malini, A.K. Hangal, Jaya Bachchan, and more. Indian films love to experiment with tone and genre, but the confidence of “Sholay” set a golden standard. It starts as a buddy comedy filled with heists and hijinks, then slips into the sweet mundanity of village life with its rose-colored promises of the future. After Gabbar’s introduction, it goes full Western (but not without a ridiculous detour into Veeru’s love life). To watch “Sholay” is to be sublimely entertained — amused, shocked, charmed, moved, and everything in between — and captivated by a voracious kind of filmmaking that grows rarer by the day. Bachchan and Dharmendra’s magnificent duo drives the film, and also parallels the pairing of Kumar’s dignified resolve and Khan’s anarchic villainy. R.D. Burman’s soundtrack delivered nostalgic hits like “Yeh Dosti” and “Jab Tak Hai Jaan,” which drive the story rather than interrupt it, and Salim-Javed’s dialogue is quoted across India to this day. It’s extraordinary that “Sholay” became one of the most famous movies ever made, and all the more extraordinary that it earns every bit of its enduring popularity. —PK John Cassavetes, his wife Gena Rowlands, and his dear friend Peter Falk created a total explosion in 1974 with “A Woman Under the Influence,” which features some of the most searing and self-possessed screen acting of all time. Gena Rowlands’ turn as mentally anguished housewife Mabel Longhetti remains a peerless master class — an embodiment so soul-deep that it’s no exaggeration to suggest that it completely dissolves the barrier between performance and reality. But Falk holds his own as her husband Nick, who careens from serene — and sensitive to his wife’s condition — to throwdown impatience over her antics yet again, and again, and again. Originally, Rowlands and Cassavetes (who does not star in this film) envisioned “A Woman Under the Influence” as a stage play, but the intensity of Nick and Mabel’s emotional knockout fights — leading up to Mabel eventually being all but 5150ed — would surely have flattened Rowlands too greatly if she had to live it on stage multiple nights a week. Without studio backing, Cassavetes seemingly made the film with glue and paper clips, but you wouldn’t know that from the extraordinary control of craft on display, as much as “A Woman Under the Influence” doesn’t exactly present itself as a controlled film. It would be more accurate to describe it as a dizzyingly beautiful display of control being lost — of a free fall in motion. Some 50 years later we’re still waiting to hit the ground. —RL “Chinatown” is almost un-blurbable, and not only because it’s a film of such classical perfection in its Old Hollywood construction that its cavernous depths can only be fully appreciated with viewing after viewing after viewing. There’s the first viewing, where it’s easy to be taken in by its surface pleasures: John A. Alonzo’s nicotine-stain cinematography, Polanski’s apex-noir shot choices, Robert Towne’s seen-it-all dialogue, Jerry Goldsmith’s ominous lament for solo trumpet, little detective-movie touches like Gittes putting a pocket watch under a car tire to capture the time that someone’s peeled away, Faye Dunaway talking about the flaw in her iris. All of it is intoxicating. Then, maybe on the second viewing, you find yourself compelled to dig deeper into the real history of a city that literally stole its water from the poor farmers of Owens Valley in order to become “L.A.” — a city of hunger built on thirst. Only in the viewings after that do the full crepuscular depths of this film’s black beating heart fully pump their way into your own bloodstream. John Huston’s Noah Cross is immediately shocking and repellant, but it’s only with prolonged exposure that one begins to recognize how deeply the personal, sexual, and political violence Cross represents is part of the historical fabric of this country. The ultimate act of a city and a nation holding a mirror up to itself (as is usually best achieved by an outsider to both, one indelibly marked by tragedy himself in his temporary adopted country), “Chinatown” is really a mirror held up to a mirror, reflecting back a city and its dream reflections of itself over and over and over again. “Chinatown” is the famous shot of a million Charles Foster Kanes repeated to infinity in Xanadu’s mirrors as an entire feature. It’s Jimmy Stewart looking into the abyss off the bell-tower roof in “Vertigo.” It achieves that effect with a singularly devious subtlety. Chinatown” is an example of how true mastery always trumps virtuosity — restraint over flash, craft over spectacle. It’s a cinema that’s grown up, that doesn’t believe in the lies of its dreamtown or of the medium best associated with it, but finds those lies ever-intoxicating and irresistible nonetheless. And it always comes back for more. —CB Rainer Werner Fassbinder effortlessly took to science fiction in “World on a Wire,” reorienting his recurring use of reflective surfaces as a means of illustrating both surveillance-state dystopia and identity confusion over the simulation program that presents its wired-in residents a false reality. That this simulation exists not merely to produce more docile citizens, but also to act as a kind of aggressive consumer testing for capitalist interests, only further stresses the dehumanization of the premise. For all of its heady concepts, however, the film finds the director frequently cutting loose with ideas, using the excuse of a constructed reality to freely blend imagery of 20th-century Germany and pop culture. A timely disco rave rubs up against a Weimar-esque cabaret, and the soundtrack runs the gamut from a performance of Marlene Dietrich classic “The Boys in the Back Room” to Fleetwood Mac. This is one of Fassbinder’s most daring tribute/critiques of his nation’s addled and divided sense of self, at once at the cutting-edge of technology, economic growth, and culture but freighted by the immense burden of a history that lurks around every corner. —JC From the ashes of an aborted Napoleon film, Stanley Kubrick fashioned one of the most lushly beautiful movies ever made out of William Makepeace Thackeray’s picaresque novel about an Irish rogue who cons his way from lowly ruffian to nouveau riche nobility and back down again. Pioneering techniques for shooting in low-light and candlelit conditions, Kubrick and cinematographer John Alcott capture painterly landscapes worthy of Watteau and intensely detailed, densely populated interiors indebted to cheeky 18th century artist William Hogarth. Even the director’s usual icy mood and arch critical distance cannot preclude an immersive quality almost entirely unseen in period cinema to that point. Beneath the surface, though, “Barry Lyndon” is one of Kubrick’s funniest movies, wielding Ryan O’Neal’s prickly personality to reflect the way that Barry’s social-climbing schemes usually succeed through bullheaded stubbornness rather than adroit manipulation. Ryan O’Neal’s Barry is a loathsome boor who keeps failing upward, finding along the way that people at every rung of the hierarchy are equally petty and venal and differ only in their ability to dress up these flaws in politesse. —JC Djibril Diop Mambéty’s “Touki Bouki” is one of the most stylistically inventive films of the 1970s. Made on a shoestring budget in post-independence Senegal, it follows two young lovers as they scheme to escape Dakar for Paris. The film’s fragmented editing, layered sound, and erratic structure reflect the characters’ restless desire to leave — as well as their confusion about what leaving really means. Both home and destination are shaped by the same colonial past. A landmark of African cinema, “Touki Bouki” remains a singular, disillusioned portrait of youth caught between dreams and dislocation. —TO A smirking meditation on authenticity that profiles art forger Elmy de Hory, hoax biographer Clifford Irving, and Orson Welles’ Yugoslavian paramour Oja Kodar as part of an elaborate attempt to disguise its own trickery, “F for Fake” isn’t just cinema’s most playful self-portrait, it’s also its most dazzling statement of purpose. “Art is a lie that makes us see the truth,” Welles quotes Picasso as saying, and “F for Fake” offers an impossibly fitting gracenote to the career of an American titan whose work — from “The War of the Worlds” to “Citizen Kane” and beyond — hinged on the power of showmanship in a world all too eager to believe its own eyes. And ears. “For the next hour,” Welles proclaims in the first reel, “everything in this film will be based on solid fact.” But it’s the rest of time that “F for Fake” is most concerned with, and Welles’ fascination with charlatans, forgeries, and doublespeak indeed cuts deeper than ever at a time when we’re all at the mercy of our worst hucksters. To revisit this endlessly knotted Magic Eye puzzle of an essay film today is to appreciate that nothing has changed beyond the sloppiness of the world’s sleight-of-hand. As Welles says of Irving’s fraud: “It may well be the hoax of the century, but, really, this is not, you know, in any way the century of the hoax. We hanky-panky men have always been with you.” And they always will be. If only they took as much pleasure in it as Welles did. If only they gave so much of that pleasure back to us in return. —DE Released a year ahead of America’s bicentennial, Robert Altman’s panoramic view of celebrity and politics represents a high point of Altman’s experimental naturalism. Joan Tewkesbury’s script — or blueprint, given Altman’s tendency to improvise — splits the difference between New Journalism field reporting and biting social satire. The question of whether “Nashville” celebrates or condescends to the music and people of the eponymous setting still incites debates. The film’s poignant, downbeat ending recalls the political assassinations that dominated the previous decade and presages the shocking celebrity-based violence that would come to define the remainder of the century. As Altman’s film strenuously argues, everyone wants to be famous, no matter what the cost. We’re way past the point where identifying that celebrity and politics are two sides of the same coin can be considered a novel observation, but Altman never lectures the audience about the idea anyway. He merely integrates it into the infrastructure. The gap between unseen populist presidential candidate Hal Phillip Walker, whose banal observations blare through the streets like hokey pabulum, and the aspiring singers that flit through the film’s margins is as thin as paper. Only Barbara Jean (Ronee Blakley), the fragile country singer constantly on the brink of a nervous breakdown, seems to recognize that fame is merely a gateway to being used by friends and strangers alike. Like all great works, “Nashville” uses its narrow scope to probe at universal ideas—about the ways social environments breed and warp personal aspirations and how the proliferation of images permanently distorted reality. In one sense, “Nashville,” much like lothario singer Tom Frank, played by Keith Carradine, is easy, at least to describe in the abstract. But it’s much more difficult to explain the feeling of being immersed in its world. Altman and his players construct a lattice of pleasures and heartbreaks, vulnerable desires and duplicitous actions, local struggles and national wounds that rarely feel contrived or artificial. So much of the film feels like listening in on people’s lives, catching glimpses of their personalities as they move through the world, and projecting joy or sorrow onto their behavior. Altman allows his audience to get to know his characters, but he also keeps them at a crucial distance. It’s not unlike the experience of having a long chat with a stranger at a bar: you get to know them, but you will never perceive the full picture. This clash between familiar intimacy and fundamental unknowability at the heart of “Nashville” lends it a uniquely peerless quality. Fifty years later, It’s still one of a kind. —VM The first time you watch Nagisa Ōshima’s “In the Realm of the Senses,” it might seem like more of a horror movie than a love story. This is, after all, a claustrophobic — and broadly true — saga of erotic obsession from the most hostile of Japanese auteurs; a mad and scandalous work of art that’s full of unsimulated sex, peppered with a massacre’s worth of little deaths, and topped off with a scene of genital amputation so unflinching that it feels like an answer to the eyeball cut in Buñuel’s “Un Chien Andalou.” Even if you’re willing to consider that Abe Sada chops off Ishida Kichizō’s penis as an act of love and mutual liberation, it still hurts to watch. The most notorious and universal of Ōshima’s transgressions, “In the Realm of the Senses” has never been at risk of aging, but its carnal revolt against the rising tide of militarism has only become more relevant over the course of recent years, as has its naked and pungent reaction to the dangers of living in a country that’s ashamed of all the wrong stuff. “Love of a country is a strange thing,” Ōshima once said. “Just puffing out your chest with national pride and telling people how wonderful your country is does not constitute love of country as I see it. You have to tell the truth about your country, whatever it is.” Ōshima saw “In the Realm of the Senses” as a chance to seduce people into looking at themselves. It would be erotic but not titillating, arousing but not exploitative. It would offset the mucus, viscera, and verisimilitude of hardcore porn with the matter-of-factness of a nature documentary. In the end, it does all that and more. The film gradually becomes so cocooned inside its crust of dried sex that viewers start to get turned off just as they begin to realize there’s nowhere else for them to go. —DE A singularly crucial text in the myth of Werner Herzog, “Aguirre, the Wrath of God” endures as cinema’s most lucid (self)portrait of the madness that some men develop in response to the sheer poverty of their own power — in response to the hard fact that death is the only destiny that nature has put aside for them. It’s a film about how the hardness of that fact compels such men to invent a new destiny for themselves; how it gives them the will required to lead a suicide march in search of El Dorado, or in Herzog’s case the will to recreate one. The ecstatically true story of the 16th century conquistadors who splintered away from Gonzalo Pizarro’s expedition and disappeared into the Amazon rainforest, never to be seen again, “Aguirre” is steeped in a fever from its opening shots, which find the Spaniards forcing their slaves down through the clouds of the Urubamba Valley as if descending into heaven. The biblical drama of the Peruvian landscape is further exaggerated by the clinical disinterest Herzog takes in the the human folly he stages against it (a reflection of the apathy the jungle shows to us all), which is set to the novocaine-like numbness of Popol Vuh’s airy score, and unravels with the natural calm of river water floating downstream. Klaus Kinski’s feral performance as the demented Aguirre is all the more affecting for how it preserves that sense of calm amid his character’s increasingly grandiose delirium. The actor’s jagged face had long struck Herzog as the only human landscape that could fully convey the destructive indifference of nature itself, and here in the first of their violent and spectacular collaborations Kinski is so possessed by mad pride that he seems to wield the wrath of god to the same degree he suffers from it. Movie characters have never been more primitive, but in a film so cut to the bone — a film whose abject denial of poetry suffuses every scene with an inescapable unreality — Aguirre’s wide-eyed sense of purpose is no less divine than Herzog’s determination to capture it on camera. —DE Ridley Scott’s “Alien” (1979) didn’t just explode the sci-fi genre — it redefined what it meant to make a blockbuster with brains and blood. A haunting, slow-burn thriller with the visual sophistication of an art film and the unrelenting terror of a monster movie, “Alien” pushed the boundaries of genre cinema and delivered a protagonist who would go on to reshape the cinematic landscape: Ellen Ripley, played as only the brilliant Sigourney Weaver could. Weaver isn’t even the first name you see in the opening credits — that honor goes to Tom Skerritt — but by the time the credits roll, there’s no mistaking who this film belongs to. Ripley doesn’t start off as the obvious hero. She becomes one — forged in trauma, quick-thinking, and sheer will. Her emergence 45 minutes in, amid a cascade of terror, feels revolutionary even now. Scott’s decision to re-gender the lead (originally written as a man by screenwriter Dan O’Bannon) was a seismic move. In an era dominated by masculine action heroes — from “Apocalypse Now” to “Moonraker” — Ripley was a revelation: competent, logical, unshakably brave, but never stripped of her humanity. She doesn’t just survive the alien. She outwits it, outlasts it, and in doing so, becomes the rare kind of cinematic icon who actually earns her place in the pantheon. Weaver’s final showdown — flamethrower in hand, fear in her eyes — is the ultimate mic drop on a decade of genre excess. She saves the ship, the cat, herself, and maybe cinema itself. “Alien” isn’t just one of the best films of the ’70s. It’s a blueprint for how genre filmmaking can be smart, subversive, and unforgettable. Want the job done right? Send Ripley. Send “Alien.” —KE Francis Ford Coppola devotees — and Coppola himself — often like to describe “The Godfather” and “The Godfather Part II” as one single, seamless film. But that well-intentioned praise falls short of capturing what Coppola actually accomplished with his sequel. After all, the only thing harder than making “The Godfather” might be embarking on a follow-up to an era-defining film that is universally agreed to have a perfect ending. Coppola had more resources at his disposal the second time around, but the expectations were infinitely higher as well. Nevertheless, he still found a way to deliver a movie that deepens the ideas established in its predecessor without resting on its laurels or undoing any of the magic. Rather than give audiences more of the same, Coppola dove head first into a bifurcated narrative structure that illustrates the way the Corleone family’s future is inextricably linked to its past. As Al Pacino’s Michael Corleone sinks his claws deeper and deeper into a life that his father never wanted for him, relative newcomer Robert De Niro fills the massive shoes left behind by Marlon Brando in an origin story that washes away all of the lies these mafiosos tell themselves about their line of work: At the end of the day it isn’t about family or survival, but a simple raw lust for power and revenge that can never be satisfied. “Part II” will never be quoted or referenced as much as its predecessor, and it’s slightly easier to walk away from if you happen to stumble on a half-finished basic cable broadcast while flipping channels. But what it sacrifices in montage-able moments, it more than makes up for with its textual depth. The first film is a straightforward gangster movie executed at the highest possible level, but the follow-up is a morality play of cosmic proportions. Coppola never shies away from Michael’s original reluctance to seize the throne or the downsides of the job, but “Part II” rips away every semblance of glamour and shreds the family structures that made Michael’s success possible until we’re forced to discard every interpretation except the reality that none of this was worth it. If “The Godfather” is the ultimate movie about a man who decides to sell his soul, “Part II” is just as definitive a portrait of what happens when the universe shows up to collect what it’s owed. —CZ It’s “The Godfather.” Francis Ford Coppola’s 1972 masterpiece remains one of the definitive films of the ‘70s — a decade that stands for cinematic reinvention and a Hollywood-backed turn to more nuanced storytelling. More than just a “gangster movie,” it’s an operatic meditation on power, family, and corruption, wrapped in a mythic tale about the real price of the American Dream (read: pretty damn steep). And actors, boy, did we have actors back then. Marlon Brando’s unforgettable portrayal of Vito Corleone brought a weary, commanding presence to the screen, embodying the complex patriarch at the heart of this crime dynasty. Meanwhile, Al Pacino’s evolution from hesitant outsider to ruthless Mafia boss offers a masterclass in character transformation that fueled the film’s emotional core. Their performances, alongside one the best ensembles to ever be assembled on-screen, anchor a story that’s as intimate as it is epic. Coppola’s direction pairs perfectly with Gordon Willis’ iconic “shadow play” cinematography, creating a visual palette that feels both grand and suffocating — a world drenched in darkness and moral ambiguity. Nino Rota’s haunting score adds a layer of melancholy that lingers beyond the screen, turning every scene into something timeless. Even all these years on, few films have been able to so ably interrogate what it truly costs to succeed in America, exposing the price of loyalty, power, and legacy with unflinching honesty. Decades later, “The Godfather” remains a cultural touchstone, shaping not just the gangster genre but the very language of American cinema in the 1970s. It’s a film that captures the era’s restless spirit while standing as a timeless masterpiece. Not just one of the best films of the ‘70s, one of the best films of all time. We don’t see that changing any time soon. —KE Chantal Akerman’s anti-epic is a film composed of all the quotidian bits of life that are usually elided through editing, its construction foregrounding how the daily tasks we consider too boring for the silver screen are more often than not also traditionally viewed as “woman’s work.” Akerman captures every chore of Delphine Seyrig’s housewife in such excruciating detail that even her moonlighting sex work becomes just another line on the to-do list alongside preparing meals and cleaning. And yet, in its deliberate lack of incident, “Jeanne Dielman” slowly wrings tension out of the most banal variations on rigid schedules. A dropped utensil generates a jolt akin to Raymond Burr finally looking up into the camera in “Rear Window,” and a break in Jeanne’s tic of turning off the light when she leaves a room hints at a blurring of her separate lives as a housekeeper and sex worker. These infinitesimal discrepancies accumulate like chaotic fractals that prefigure an explosive finale that would feel abrupt and nonsensical without them but becomes a logical catharsis thanks to the subtle breadcrumb trail Akerman scatters over three hours. In its own way, “Jeanne Dielman” is as radical a synthesis of cinematic possibility as has ever been made, and one of the finest distillations of just how much can be communicated through blocking and precise editing over dialogue. —JC “Saló, or the 120 Days of Sodom” has been seen as a cursed object since before it first premiered in the fall of 1975, three weeks after writer-director Pier Paolo Pasolini was tortured and then killed on a beach in Ostia; his murder remains unsolved in the strictest sense, but all signs point to the crime as an expression of the same fascistic impulse that his final film so fearlessly distills into its purest form. Immediately censored, widely banned, and so enduringly controversial that the likes of Alec Baldwin was compelled to defend its honor in a legal brief as recently as 2009, “Saló” has become synonymous with the extreme, the verboten, that which is beyond the bounds of good taste. Its title is a veritable shorthand for something difficult to stomach. And yet, to recognize that some people continue to be more perturbed by Pasolini’s film than they are by the pornographic cruelties of the world that inspired him to make it is to recognize why it was necessary for him to make it in the first place. Loosely adapted from the Marquis de Sade’s “The 120 Days of Sodom,” its 18th century debaucheries updated for the final days of the Mussolini regime, “Saló” tells the story of four ghoulish libertines who kidnap 18 teenagers, abscond to a remote mansion, and subject their innocent hostages to several months of extreme degradation. The youths are at the absolute mercy of their captors, who assume total control of their bodies across a series of dehumanizing rituals that begin with rape, progress to shit-eating, and ultimately climax in a mess of medieval barbarities. Vile enough on its face, Pasolini’s film is thoroughly suffused with the soullessness of its villains (particularly Aldo Valetti’s anus-obsessed “President,” whose crooked smile is more frightening than any of the tortures Pasolini’s cast had to fake for the camera); from Ennio Morricone’s jaunty opening tune to the upsetting symmetry of Pasolini’s compositions and the persistent sense of “fun” that stains even the worst of the horrors framed within, “Saló” insists on being received as a Dantean parody of the dictatorships and puppet states that destabilized so much of the 20th century, and continue to recur throughout history. “The one true anarchy is that of power,” the fanatical Duke proclaims, and “Saló” remains cinema’s most confrontational — and therefore most necessary — vision of the perverted chaos that autocrats seek to create under the guise of state control. —DE In the dying moments of the 1970s, Bob Fosse re-centered American cinema on the personal and hyper-subjective with “All That Jazz,” shattering the end of a decade whose movies had been fiercely preoccupied with the fractiousness of the social order. Here, in his penultimate film and greatest masterpiece, Fosse’s personal demons are on full, dazzling display, as the jazz dance legend electrifyingly fictionalized how his various addictions reached a fever pitch while editing “Lenny” at the same time as he tried to mount “Chicago” on Broadway. In doing so, Fosse’s diaristic hall of mirrors pushed the entire genre of movie musical itself into the self-reflexive headspace that it’s occupied ever since (as can be seen in everything from “Dancer in the Dark” to Annette” and, naturally, “Chicago”). “All That Jazz” blends fantasy and reality — memory and delusion — to create a celluloid autobiography that remains unparalleled for its raw emotional honesty and proximity to its subject, with Roy Scheider boldly and beautifully embodying Fosse alter-ego Joe Gideon. He’s a chain-smoking, Dexedrine-popping, booze-guzzling workaholic, the kind of bottomless pit of a man who tells his girlfriend (played by Fosse’s protégé and real-life romantic partner Ann Reinking), when she says “I wish you weren’t so generous with your cock,” that he might like to use that line in a screenplay. “All That Jazz” also doubles as a sensational, shaggy backstage docudrama about the makings of Fosse’s song and dance — the script with its pierced venomous heart co-written by Robert Alan Aurthur, with Fosse choreographing the film himself. By the time Scheider is zipped up in a body bag at the movie’s end, having imagined the show of his own life in his head in his dying moments, it’s impossible not to feel winded by the experience of a wildly self-important spectacle that’s every inch as grand a portrait of an artist as “8 1/2,” “Andrei Rublev,” or “Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters.” “All That Jazz” is also the rare example of a movie musical that goes deeper than it could have on the stage, with Fosse utilizing the medium — at the height of his powers — with the reckless abandon of someone discovering it for the first time. It’s a movie that reflects all of the genius and unalloyed vision that had defined the previous decade in American film. And when Joe Gideon died, the ’70s died with him. —RL By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

August 18, 2025 06:21 ET | Source: Alkane Resources Limited Alkane Resources Limited PERTH, Australia, Aug. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As originally indicated in an investor announcement dated 14 August 2025, Alkane Resources Limited (ASX: ALK; TSX: ALK; OTCQX: ALKEF) is pleased to provide the latest exploration results for drilling in the region around the Company’s Tomingley Gold Operations in Central New South Wales: Alkane Managing Director & CEO, Nic Earner, said: “We continue to explore at Tomingley within our approved mining areas and regionally, seeking to add further mine life, scale, and grade to Tomingley. It is pleasing to see the extent of mineralisation in the broader Tomingley region, and we look forward to continuing to add to our resource base.” Tomingley Gold Project Alkane Resources Ltd 100% The Tomingley Gold Project (TGP) covers an area of approximately 440 km2 stretching 60 km north-south along the Newell Highway from Tomingley in the north, through Peak Hill and almost to Parkes in the south. The TGP contains Alkane’s currently operating TGO, an open pit and underground operation with a 1 Mtpa processing facility. Over the past several years Alkane has conducted an extensive regional exploration program that led to the definition of Mineral Resources at the Roswell and San Antonio deposits (ASX Announcement 2 May 2022 and ASX Announcement 16 February 2021), separate from the established resources and reserves at TGO. Alkane has completed a 2.7 km long drive from the Wyoming One open cut to Roswell. Roswell and San Antonio now form part of TGO, with processing of ore mined from underground at Roswell beginning in April 2024. The focus for the exploration team has turned to other targets within the TGP, both near-mine and further out from TGO. Exploration over the previous 12 months for TGP comprised high-resolution drone magnetics, air-core drilling testing the Mingelo Volcanic belt between El Paso prospect and Peak Hill, and deeper RC/DD drilling testing El Paso, Tomingley Structure, and the historic Tomingley workings that are all located within 7 km of the Tomingley processing facility. As part of the recent exploration drilling, assay results were received from 233 air-core (AC) drill holes for a total of 16,693 metres; 6 reverse circulation (RC) drill holes for a total of 1,442 metres; and 6 diamond core (DD) drill holes for a total of 1,883 metres. The exploration undertaken: El Paso The El Paso prospect is ~2 km south of the San Antonio deposit (406,000 oz Au * details in appended table). Mineralisation associated with attenuated volcanic units was discovered at this prospect in 2017. Several programs of drilling intersected multiple zones of mineralisation, however the complexity of the geology, the widespread alteration and difficult drilling conditions has so far impeded the effective delineation of substantial gold resources. Four mud rotary collared DD holes were recently completed to further test significant gold mineralisation associated with a dacite volcanic unit intersected in the previous round of drilling by EPD013 – 12 m @ 1.50 g/t Au from 297 m (ASX announcement 7 October 2024). Significant gold mineralisation includes intercepts that are approximately true thickness (estimated at 90%): The dacite has a northeast strike length of over 400m, dips to the southeast and appears truncated by a subvertical north-trending shear zone along strike and down dip to the east. The dacite is believed to continue at depth to the south (west of the shear zone).The mineralisation appears to continue down dip (across the shear zone) within the volcaniclastic sediments, as a possible conduit structure to the mineralisation hosted in the dacite. A further 2,000m of mud rotary diamond core drilling is planned to begin in September to contribute to defining an exploration target for El Paso. One RC drill hole was planned to test an Au-As zone of mineralisation previously intersected by three AC drill holes, 1 km southeast of El Paso (ASX announcement 7 October 2024). Unfortunately, the RC drill hole failed to overcome the sandy alluvial overburden and underlying saprolitic regolith, terminating in gold mineralised bedrock at 124m, grading 0.22 g/t Au. Mud rotary diamond drilling is being prioritised to test this new prospect properly. EPD017 – Sericite-carbonate altered dacite with sheeted quartz-albite veins and pyrite-arsenopyrite selvages from 6.1m interval grading 3.03 g/t Au from 120.9 m. Tomingley Structure prospects The ‘Tomingley Structure’ is an Au-As mineralised structure that extends north 5km from the historic Tomingley workings and transects the Tomingley Two prospect. The Tomingley Structure was originally delineated by reconnaissance air-core drilling north of Tomingley and identified the Tomingley One and Tomingley Two prospects (ASX announcement 8 June 2004). Mineralisation associated with the structure comprises strong quartz veining/silicification and intense sericite alteration with pyrite-arsenopyrite hosted in meta-sediments. The structure is covered by shallow alluvium immediately south of the historic Tomingley workings, deepening to approximately 30 metres at Tomingley One and to over 100 metres north of Tomingley Two. Five RC drill holes for a total of 1,318 metres tested along the ‘Tomingley Structure’. Significant gold (+0.2 g/t Au) was intersected in three holes and in addition significant arsenic (+0.1 % As) was intersected in a fourth hole. The fifth RC hole did not reach target depth due to sandy alluvium bogging the rod string, terminating the hole at 148 metres. Significant gold mineralisation from the drilling includes: Work is planned at Tomingley One (e.g. TO035 – 2m @ 10.9g/t Au from 34m; ASX announcement 8 June 2004) and Tomingley Two (e.g. TORC005 – 11m @ 1.7 g/t Au from 158m including 4m @ 3.87 g/t Au from 159m; ASX announcement 16 September 2021) prospects to better characterise the structures and lithologies integral for significant gold mineralisation. Two diamond core drill holes are planned, to collect structural measurements and to define any key lithologies focussing mineralisation. Tomingley Gold Workings and near-mine exploration Two diamond core holes were completed from surface to test near-mine targets immediately north of the mining lease. Diamond hole (PATD002) targeted 600m north of the Caloma open cut to test for an extension to the andesite that hosts the majority of the Caloma gold resources (pre-mining Caloma resource 369,400 oz Au – ASX announcement 29 March 2012). The hole intersected a package of carbonaceous shales, fine-grained volcaniclastic sediments and the Caloma andesite with an estimated true thickness of 60 metres (similar thickness as observed at Caloma). Mineralised quartz veining was observed in the footwall sediments to the andesite with a best intercept of: PATD002 5 metres grading 0.44g/t Au from 80.3 metres. Whilst only minor alteration and mineralisation was observed in the andesite, PATD002 was collared to the southwest which is not optimal for targeting Caloma’s moderately west-dipping mineralisation. Further drilling in planned to target this prospective lithology with diamond drill holes collared to the east, from the west side of the Newell Highway. The historic Tomingley gold workings were targeted for the first time in Alkane’s history, with one diamond core hole (PATD001). The workings (Crowhurst & Sons Mine – 62kg Au production 1883-1911) are an estimated 117m deep, PATD001 was targeted 30 metres below this depth. The drilling intersected a package of carbonaceous shales and volcaniclastic siltstones that was host to a 30-m-thick quartz reef with significant pyrite (and trace arsenopyrite) mineralisation. The quartz reef below the workings returned a best intercept of: PATD001 9.5 metres grading 0.27 g/t Au from 175.5 metres. The historic average head grade at Crowhurst is recorded as 26 g/t Au, so there are likely strong plunge controls to any high-grade ore shoots. Structural work is underway to determine an orientation for the existence of these shoots prior to further drill-testing. Reconnaissance AC drilling 233 air-core drill holes were completed for 16,693 metres along nominal 800 m-spaced traverses to test an approximate 2 km x 7 km section of the Mingelo Volcanic Belt between El Paso prospect and Peak Hill. The section of the belt is blind, covered by alluvium ranging from only a few metres to over 50 metres. Three potential new zones of mineralisation were discovered: Southeast of El Paso – Two holes (EPAC213 - 4) intersected Au-As mineralisation in weathered basaltic andesite, approximately 1 km southeast of El Paso, and 400 m southwest of previously AC defined Au-As mineralisation.This apparent northeast mineralisation trend parallels the orientation observed at El Paso. Significant Au-As anomalism was also intersected (EPAC201 – 2, JNAC042) along the eastern margin for 800 m of the extensive basaltic-andesite unit. Best Au intercepts include: Westray – Two holes (WSAC092, 94) intersected significant Au-As anomalism in volcaniclastic sediments proximal to andesites. Best Au intercepts include: Two deeper RC or DD drill holes are planned to test the coincident AC and soils Au-As target at Westray and the El Paso SE prospect. Planned exploration program Planned exploration around the Tomingley Gold Operations (TGO) for the next 12 months comprises a high-resolution drone magnetic survey over the area surrounding and including Peak Hill to delineate fertile structures and to map new volcanic terrain beneath the cover sequence to the east of Peak Hill. Other exploration involves work at numerous prospects, including 6,000m of deeper RC/DD drilling, comprising: El Paso, El Paso SE, Tomingley One, Tomingley Two, Caloma North (orogenic Au) – diamond drilling; Glen Isla (epithermal Au) – mapping, induced polarisation (IP) survey and diamond drilling; Westray (orogenic Au) – RC drilling; Reconnaissance, McGregors (orogenic Au) – air-core drilling; Gundong (magmatic Ni, orogenic Au) – air-core drilling; Trewilga (orogenic Au) – soil sampling. In parallel with routine grade control surface drilling at the planned San Antonio open cuts and underground drilling at Roswell underground, a significant underground drilling program is testing McLeans, Roswell North and the Roswell Western Monzodiorite. These results are anticipated in October. * hole finished in mineralisation. ** hole abandoned early. True widths are approximately 90% (El Paso) and 60% (Tomingley Two and Tomingley Workings) of intercept width.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.” — Richard Feynman Number of the Week: 93% pre-industrial? THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: TWTW begins with the highlights of Andrew Bolt’s interview of Steven Koonin then continues with a discussion of key issues in the report by the Climate Working Group to the Secretary of Energy. TWTW concludes with a discussion of increasing greenhouse gases today. ********************* Koonin Interviews: John Robson posted his long interview of Steven Koonin on Climate Change Nexus. Also, Paul Homewood posted an interview of Koonin by Andrew Bolt. Koonin is one of the five independent scientists who participated in the Climate Working Group that produced special report prepared for the US Department of Energy (DOE) titled ‘A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate.’ Koonin was formerly Obama’s Under Secretary for Science, Department of Energy: The Bolt interview is short and succinct. Among the key points Koonin made are: TWTW has reviewed independent comments from three of the five scientists comprising the Climate Working Group concerning their report. Thus far, there appears to be no comments from John Christy or Ross McKitrick. No one has suggested that anyone in the Department of Energy interfered with the preparation or publication of the report. As the preface of the report states: ‘This document originated in late March 2025 when Secretary Wright assembled an independent group to write a report on issues in climate science relevant for energy policymaking, including evidence and perspectives that challenge the mainstream consensus. We agreed to undertake the work on the condition that there would be no editorial oversight by the Secretary, the Department of Energy, or any other government personnel. This condition has been honored throughout the process, and the writing team has worked with full independence.’[Boldface added] See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ********************* Review of the Climate Working Group Report (Part 1): The body of “A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate” opens with: ‘Part I: Direct Human Influence On Ecosystems and the Climate I Carbon Dioxide as a Pollutant Chapter summary: Carbon dioxide (CO2) differs in many ways from the so-called Criteria Air Pollutants. It does not affect local air quality and has no human toxicological implications at ambient levels. It is an issue of concern because of its effects on the global climate.’ After discussing the Clean Air Act of 1970 and the six so-called Criteria Air Contaminants subject to EPA regulation the chapter concludes with: ‘Ambient outdoor air today contains about 430 parts per million (ppm) CO2, increasing at about 2 ppm per year. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration issues guidelines for indoor workplaces in which elevated CO2 might be encountered, such as where dry ice is used. The Permissible Exposure Limit is 5,000 ppm over 8 hours (OSHA, 2024). Allen et al. (2015) reported evidence of diminished performance on some cognitive tasks among workers in office cubicles when exposed to CO2 levels above 1,000-1,500 ppm. These levels are far larger than any plausible ambient outdoor value through the end of the 22nd century. The growing amount of CO2 in the atmosphere directly influences the earth system by promoting plant growth (global greening), thereby enhancing agricultural yields, and by neutralizing ocean alkalinity. But the primary concern about CO2 is its role as a greenhouse gas (GHG) that alters the earth’s energy balance, warming the planet. How the climate will respond to that influence is a complex question that will occupy much of this report.’ [Boldface added] The next chapter starts with: ‘2 Direct Impacts of CO2 on the Environment Chapter summary: CO2 enhances photosynthesis and improves plant water use efficiency, thereby promoting plant growth. Global greening is due in part to increased CO2 levels in the atmosphere is well-established on all continents. CO2 absorption in sea water makes the oceans less alkaline. The recent decline in pH is within the range of natural variability on millennial time scales. Most ocean life evolved when the oceans were mildly acidic. Decreasing pH might adversely affect corals, although the Australian Great Barrier Reef has shown considerable growth in recent years. TWTW is uncertain about the statement “Most ocean life evolved when the oceans were mildly acidic” with a pH slightly below 7. Most ocean life may have may have evolved with a pH slightly above 7, mildly alkaline. But this is a minor point of uncertainty, not a contention. The chapter continues with: 2.1 CO2 as a contributor to global greening The growing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has the important positive effect of promoting plant growth by enhancing photosynthesis and improving water use efficiency. That is evident in the ‘global greening’ phenomenon discussed below, as well as in the improving agricultural yields discussed in Chapter 10. Here we focus just on CO2 fertilization; research on combined effects due to temperature and precipitation changes are discussed in Chapter 10. 2.1.1 Measurement of global greening ‘Greening’ refers to an increase in the fraction of the Earth’s surface covered by plants. It can be quantified by the ‘Leaf Area Index’ (LAI) measured by satellite. Many studies over the past decade have confirmed a global greening pattern (increase in LAI) attributable in part to rising CO2 levels. Zhu et al. (2016) was one of the first studies to report that global greening was detectable using satellite sensors. From 1982 to 2011 they detected greening over 25-50 percent of the Earth versus ‘browning’ over only four percent and attributed 70 percent of the greening to rising CO2 levels (see Figure 2.1). Other contributors included land-use changes, warming and nitrogen. The fraction attributable to CO2 was largest in the tropics; other factors played more dominant roles in CONUS.’ Here we see the tremendous difference between this report and the UN IPCC and US National Climate Assessment reports. Reports on the effects of CO2 that ignore the importance of global greening have major omissions that are a form of “cherry picking” leading to highly biased conclusions. As the Climate Working Group report states: 2.1.4 CO2 fertilization benefits in IPCC Reports “The IPCC has only minimally discussed global greening and CO2 fertilization of agricultural crops. The topic is briefly acknowledged in a few places in the body of the IPCC 6th and earlier Assessment Reports but is omitted in all Summary documents. Section 2.3.4.3.3 of the AR6 Working Group I report, entitled “global greening and browning,” points out that the IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land had concluded with high confidence that greening had increased globally over the past 2-3 decades. It then discusses that there are variations in the greening trend among data sets, concluding that while they have high confidence greening has occurred, they have low confidence in the magnitude of the trend. There are also brief mentions of CO2 fertilization effects and improvements in water use efficiency in a few other chapters in the AR6 Working Groups I and II Reports. Overall, however, the Policymaker Summaries, Technical Summaries, and Synthesis Reports of AR5 and AR6 do not discuss the topic.” [Boldface added] The chapter continues with: “2.2 The Alkaline Oceans 2.2.1 Changing pH. A neutral aqueous solution has a pH of 7.0, while one with pH greater than 7.0 is alkaline (also termed basic) and with pH less than 7.0 is acidic. The modern-day global average pH of surface sea water is estimated to be 8.04 (Copernicus Marine Service 2025, Figure 2.3), down from an estimated value of 8.2 in pre-Industrial times (Gattuso and Hansson, 2011). As CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere increased, the oceans absorbed more, which decreases their pH. Depending upon the oceans’ buffering capacity, they are expected to become somewhat less alkaline over time, consistent with the observed decrease in pH.” Figure 2.3 is omitted here but in the text. “While this process is often called ‘ocean acidification,’ that is a misnomer because the oceans are not expected to become acidic; ‘ocean neutralization’ would be more accurate. Even if the water were to turn acidic, it is believed that life in the oceans evolved when the oceans were mildly acidic with pH 6.5 to 7.0 (Krissansen-Totton et al., 2018). On the time scale of thousands of years, boron isotope proxy measurements show that ocean pH was around 7.4 or 7.5 during the last glaciation (up to about 20,000 years ago) increasing to present-day values as the world warmed during deglaciation (Rae et al., 2018). Thus, ocean biota appears to be resilient to natural long-term changes in ocean pH since marine organisms were exposed to wide ranges in pH.” The Climate Working Group refutes the fear of “ocean acidification” promoted by NOAA during the Obama administration. Indeed, there are sections of the oceans above geothermal vents where the waters are acidic, pH below 7, where shellfish and other marine life live. The chapter concludes with: “In summary, ocean life is complex and much of it evolved when the oceans were acidic relative to the present. The ancestors of modern coral first appeared about 245 million years ago. CO2 levels for more than 200 million years afterward were many times higher than they are today. Much of the public discussion of the effects of ocean ‘acidification’ on marine biota has been one-sided and exaggerated.” [Boldface added] Chapter 3 begins with: “3 Human Influences on the Climate Chapter Summary: The global climate is naturally variable on all time scales. Anthropogenic CO2 emissions add to that variability by changing the total radiative energy balance in the atmosphere. The IPCC has downplayed the role of the sun in climate change but there are plausible solar irradiance reconstructions that imply it contributed to recent warming. Climate projections are based on IPCC emission scenarios that have tended to exceed observed trends. Most academic climate impact studies in recent years are based upon the extreme RCP 8.5 scenario that is now considered implausible; its use as a business-as-usual scenario has been misleading. Carbon cycle models connect annual emissions to growth in the atmospheric CO2 stock. While models disagree over the rate of land and ocean CO2 uptake, all agree that it has been increasing since 1959. There is evidence that urbanization biases in the land warming record have not been completely removed from climate data sets. 3.1 Components of radiative forcing and their history 3.1.1 Historical radiative forcing A changing climate has been the norm throughout the Earth’s 4.6-billion-year history. The Earth’s temperature and weather patterns change naturally over timescales ranging from decades to millions of years. Natural variations in the surface climate originate in two ways. Internal climate fluctuations associated with circulations in the atmosphere and ocean exchange energy, water, and carbon between the atmosphere, oceans, land, and ice. External influences on the climate system include variations in the energy received from the sun and the effects of volcanic eruptions. Human activities influence climate through changing land use and land cover. Humans are also changing the composition of the atmosphere by emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases and by altering the concentration of aerosol particles in the atmosphere. The earth is warmed by the sunlight it absorbs and is cooled by the heat it radiates to space. Averaged over the Earth’s surface, each of these processes involve power flows of about 240 Watts per square meter (W/m2). When they are in balance, there are no net external causes of warming or cooling. Both human and natural influences on the climate alter this balance and so cause the climate to change.” The Climate Working Group report presents graphs from the UN IPCC report AR6 (2021) [not shown here] then states: “These graphs show that the total radiative forcing is comprised of both natural and anthropogenic components. Carbon dioxide is the largest human influence on the climate and the one most relevant to the influence of fossil fuel use. It exerts a warming influence by decreasing the cooling power of the atmosphere. Emissions of CO2 are accumulating in the atmosphere, as described in the following section, so that the warming influence is growing. Other greenhouse gases (methane, nitrous oxide, halogens, and ozone) act similarly, currently adding another 75 percent to CO2’s warming. Aerosols exert an overall cooling effect, although with large uncertainties in the way they catalyze the formation of reflective clouds. As a result, understanding the causes of recent warming requires not just identifying the warming effects of CO2, but also the more uncertain cooling effects of aerosols.” [Boldface added] It should be noted here that the Climate Working Group is discussing what the UN IPCC asserts, not what it necessarily accepts. As stated in the last TWTW, the global climate modelers assert that the modest warming from CO2 will be amplified by an equal warming from increasing water vapor and other warming such as methane, nitrous oxide, etc. The modelers have failed to produce the physical evidence demonstrating that this additional warming from other atmospheric gases is taking place. Periods of strong warming may be due to changes in the intensity of the sunlight hitting the surface of Earth, changes in ocean circulation, or other natural changes. This section of Chapter 3 concludes with: “Figure 3.1.1 [not shown here] shows that the anthropogenic forcing component was negligible before about 1900 and has increased steadily since, rising to almost 3 W/m2 today. However, this is still only about 1 percent of the unperturbed radiation flows, making it a challenge to isolate the effects of anthropogenic forcing; state of-the-art satellite estimates of global radiative energy flows are only accurate to a few W/m2. . Natural sources of global energy imbalance other than volcanoes and total solar irradiance (TSI) are not included in these [UN IPCC] graphs because they remain largely unknown.” [Boldface added] The Climate Working Group report continues with discussions of changes in atmospheric CO2 since 1958 as measured by Mauna Loa observatory and Future emission scenarios and the carbon cycle. A key paragraph in the discussion of the carbon cycle is: “The main processes that remove excess CO2 from the atmosphere are increased growth of land vegetation (especially at high latitudes), some increase in the sequestering of carbon in soils, and uptake of CO2 by the ocean due to the increasing partial pressure of atmospheric CO2 over that of CO2 dissolved in the ocean. All twenty land carbon cycle models tracked by the Global Carbon Project (Friedlingstein et al., 2024) show land processes have been removing excess CO2 at an increasing rate since 1959. This is consistent with a ‘global greening’ phenomenon (Chapter 2.1) observed by satellites since monitoring of global greenness began in 1982.” [Boldface added] In the section Urbanization influence on temperature trends, the Climate Working Group states the UN IPCC reports largely ignore the Urban Heat Island effect (UHI) despite increasing evidence and reports that they are significant. The section and chapter conclude with: “The challenge in measuring UHI bias is relating local temperature change to a corresponding change in population or urbanization, rather than to a static classification variable such as rural or urban. Spencer et al. (2025) used newly available historical population archives to undertake such an analysis and found evidence of significant UHI bias in U.S. summertime temperature data. In summary, while there is clear warming in the land record, there is also evidence that it is biased upward by patterns of urbanization and that these biases have not been completely removed by the data processing algorithms used to produce climate data sets.” The next TWTW will discuss the Climate Working Group report on Climate Response to CO2 Emissions to include Climate Sensitivity to CO2 Forcing and Discrepancies Between Models and Instrumental Observations. ********************* Towards Understanding the Importance of Increasing Greenhouse Gases: Kenneth Richard of No Tricks Zone discusses the paper “Unsettling the settled: simple musings on the complex climatic system” by Demetris Koutsoyiannis and George Tsakalias. The paper is an interesting thought experiment presenting physical evidence, not a hypothesis. In part, the abstract states: Our revisit of fundamental issues of climate challenges the notion and term of the “greenhouse effect,” and attempts a scientific reevaluation using minimal assumptions, such as Newton’s laws, maximum entropy, and gas spectroscopy. It replaces terms like “greenhouse gas” with “radiatively active gas” (RAG) and “greenhouse effect” with “atmospheric radiative effect” (ARE). While ARE exist in several planets’ atmospheres, on Earth it is primarily driven by water vapor and clouds, with CO2 playing a minor role (especially anthropogenic CO2 which represents 4% of total emissions). The paper discusses the works of van Wijngaarden and Happer. Then it later states: “3.5 What factors can explain the observed temperature profile? Given the analysis of the previous subsection, it becomes clear that it is not the ARE that creates and maintains the temperature gradient. Rather the mechanisms responsible for the temperature gradient are: • the warming of the soil and liquid water by the sunshine during the day and their cooling during the night; • the water evaporation and transpiration at the surface level and condensation aloft; • the convection, and the implied vertical transfer of sensible and latent heat; • the winds caused by spatial temperature differences and influenced by Coriolis forces. These are not static forcings, but processes, i.e., perpetual changes in the climatic system. The processes occur on different time scales, some of which are too small to drive the atmosphere to the equilibrium (isothermal) state. It is noted that the processes occur at a macroscopic level, with the motion of masses of air, typically referred to as parcels. And as noted by van Wijngaarden and Happer (2023), because of the very small thermal conductivity of air, it takes a very long time for appreciable heat to flow into or out of a parcel of reasonable size. The driving mechanisms of these processes are the following: 1. Clouds form and disappear, strongly affecting the SW and LW radiation processes. 2. The Earth’s surface is not homogeneous in terms of radiation absorption and reflection (varying albedo). The massive presence of water in liquid and solid phases with different albedo values, both on the Earth’s surface (hydrosphere, cryosphere) and in the atmosphere (clouds) is responsible for spatial and temporal variations in the albedo, as well as in the thermodynamic properties of different parts of the Earth. 3. Earth is round (not flat) and the sunrays come with different slopes at different places. 4. Earth rotates around its axis on a daily basis. 5. Earth rotates around the Sun on an annual basis. 6. Earth’s orbit around the Sun is elliptical, resulting in changes in the distance between the two bodies. 7. The climatic system is complex and is subject to irregular changes.” The paper ends with: “4 Discussion and conclusions The research presented here challenges the ideas that we live in a greenhouse and that science can be settled and revisits the most fundamental topics related to climate. This is attempted in the simplest possible way and using the fewest premises, such as Newton’s laws, the principle of maximum entropy and the spectroscopic properties of gases. Additionally, the study proposes that commonly used vocabulary should be replaced by rigorous scientific terminology, the main examples being “greenhouse gas” and “greenhouse effect”, which could be replaced by “radiatively active gas” (RAG, comprising water vapor—WV—and non-condensing radiatively active gases—NC-RAGs) and “atmospheric radiative effect” (ARE), respectively. The conclusions of the analyses presented here can be summarized as follows: • There is an empirically verified ARE in the atmosphere, not only on Earth but also on the other planets. On Earth, ARE is dominated by WV and clouds, with CO2 playing a very minor role—let alone human added CO2 which represents only 4% of the total emissions to the atmosphere. [Boldface added] • Equilibrium thermodynamics clearly show (either using the principle of maximum entropy, or stochastic simulation of molecule collisions) that Earth’s atmosphere would be isothermal at the equilibrium, with or without RAGs. In an isothermal atmosphere the temperature would be slightly higher than 250 K, a value which represents the vertically average temperature of the standard atmosphere over the troposphere and stratosphere. • The fact is that the atmosphere is not isothermal. Rather, the troposphere has a vertical temperature gradient of about 6.5 K/km, which is imprinted in the standard atmosphere. The gradient is resultant of macroscopic changes that drive the atmosphere out of equilibrium. While the moist adiabatic changes play a role in shaping this gradient, they cannot fully predict real atmospheric conditions. • The mean surface temperature of 288 K, also imprinted in the standard atmosphere, is much higher than the equilibrium temperature. While RAGs (mostly WV and clouds) play a role in yielding this temperature, the critical factor is the vertical temperature gradient, without which the ARE alone would not be able to increase the equilibrium temperature. • Given the importance of the atmospheric temperature gradient, which is described by large-scale atmospheric thermodynamics, rather than radiative physics, it is puzzling that the emphasis in climate research has been on the latter. This gradient is not a universal constant, but it varies with space and time. It is therefore useful to monitor and analyze its changes. The data show that since 1950 the gradient has weakened in the tropics and grown in the polar areas resulting in decrease of the surface equator-to-pole gradient, as expected in global warming conditions. A final point worth stressing is that in complex systems, such as the climatic system, observational data are the only scientific test bed for making hypotheses and assessing their validity. Focusing on one of the factors affecting the climatic system, namely, the anthropogenic CO2 emissions, and basing on models that emphasize this factor, may distort our perception of the big picture and be detrimental to science, whose objective is to pursue the truth.” [Boldface added] TWTW disagrees with “let alone human added CO2 which represents only 4% of the total emissions to the atmosphere.” The estimated CO2 level during the last interglacial warm period 130,000 to 115,000 years ago was 260 to 280 ppmv, Since 1958, the atmospheric CO2 as measured at Mauna Loa has increased from less than 320 ppmv to over 420 ppmv. Other than human emissions, there is no satisfactory explanation for this increase. However, TWTW agrees with the substance of the paper and the importance of CO2 on weather is overemphasized by politicians and others who claim that by controlling CO2 emissions they can control the weather and climate. They cannot. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ********************* Number of the Week: 93% pre-industrial? Many commentators seem to be confused by the concept of saturation as discussed in the works of van Wijngaarden and Happer. Discussed in last week’s TWTW, Howard Hayden’s paper has an excellent graph depicting saturation (Figure 14: Net IR blockage (seen from top of atmosphere) by CO2 versus CO2 concentration, adapted from van Wijngaarden & Happer.) A very small amount of CO2 accounts for the first 10 W/m2 of blocking and less than 50 ppmv accounts for more than 20 W/m2 of blocking. The effectiveness of additional units declines as the number of units increases. At less than 100 ppmv of CO2 in the atmosphere it is said to be saturated. This means that virtually all the radiative energy in the particular frequencies (or wavelengths) that CO2 most readily absorbs and emits radiation is being absorbed and emitted. CO2’s effectiveness is limited, and higher concentrations of CO2 have limited effectiveness. If we accept that the pre-industrial CO2 was about 280 ppmv, using Hayden’s figure we can estimate that by 280 ppmv about 93% of today’s warming effect of CO2 was occurring in pre-industrial times. The human influence is small. Note that these calculations are for clear skies. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy – Radiation Transfer and Challenging the Orthodoxy.

Deeply buried on page 14 as the last paragraph of a section headed “A diverse resource mix supports grid reliability,” we find these two sentences: “Simply put, as New York seeks to retire more fossil fuel units in the coming years it will be essential to deploy new energy resources with the same reliability attributes to maintain grid reliability. Until new, non-emitting alternatives like hydrogen or advanced nuclear generation are developed and commercialized, fossil resources are needed to fill an essential role in preserving reliable grid operations.” Well as of today grid-scale hydrogen and advanced nuclear generation have not been “commercialized.” So, the only answer is to keep the fossil fuel generation going. Perhaps they should tell some of their co-bureaucrats, like NYSERDA, or the Energy Planning Board, or maybe even the Legislature or the New York City Council. But as of now NYISO’s strategy seems to be to put a warning somewhere deep in their reports just so they can say “I told you so” when the whole thing falls apart. They owe the New York citizenry much better.

Climate Lawyers Try a New Approach Heatstroke killed Julie Leon on a 108-degree day. A lawsuit blames oil companies. By Mike Toth, WSJ, Aug. 11, 2025 TWTW Summary; The research fellow at the Civitas Institute of the University of Texas Austin begins with: “Stung by a recent losing streak in state courts, the foundations, academics and trial lawyers behind the climate lawfare movement are now trying a new tactic: wrongful-death lawsuits against oil and gas companies based on the alleged connection between carbon emissions and weather-related deaths. Such efforts won’t stop until the Supreme Court affirms the federal government’s exclusive regulatory authority over interstate emissions. The leading such case, Leon v. Exxon Mobil, seeks to hold energy companies liable for the death of Julie Leon, who suffered heatstroke in her car in June 2021 after driving almost 100 miles without air conditioning on a day when temperatures hit a record-breaking 108 degrees in western Washington state. The complaint was filed in state court in May on behalf of Leon’s estate. [Boldface added] Climate lawfare previously centered on lawsuits by blue states and municipalities, which sought to transform the nation by forcing energy companies to make sweeping changes or bankrupting them with damages. These cases were based on state tort theories like public nuisance and consumer fraud. The plaintiffs maintained that energy companies deceived the public about the environmental consequences of their products, which accelerated climate change and caused harms such as wildfires and floods, which adversely affected states and cities. Even assuming these allegations are true, this theory turns the Constitution on its head. The federal government—not the states—regulates interstate activity. This means that Honolulu, Boulder, Colo., and other municipal climate-change plaintiffs can dictate local carbon policies, but they can’t decide energy policy for the U.S. as a whole. That’s Congress’s job. Judges around the country agreed. State judges in Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania have dismissed climate claims this year on jurisdictional grounds. As the Pennsylvania court noted: “Today we join a growing chorus of state and federal courts across the United States singing from the same hymnal, in concluding that the claims raised by Bucks County are not judiciable by any state court in Pennsylvania.” The Supreme Court has yet to close the door on such misuse of state-law claims. In January the justices declined to take up an appeal from the city of Honolulu’s lawsuit seeking to hold oil and gas companies liable for out-of-state conduct under state tort and consumer-protection law. With the justices so far unwilling to pre-empt the use of state tort law to regulate emissions nationwide, climate litigants are ginning up new legal claims like wrongful death. Plaintiffs who assert a link between extreme weather events and climate change still need to prove causation, which may never happen.” The article discusses issues with proving causation, then continues with. “Days before the lawsuit was filed, the Leon estate’s lawyer, Timothy Bechtold, helped the left-wing impact litigators at Our Children’s Trust seek millions in fees from a landmark Montana state court ruling that 16 youth plaintiffs were injured by climate change. Beyond wrongful-death claims, which can result only in money damages, influential climate advocates are already making the case that energy executives should face homicide prosecutions for deaths purportedly caused by climate change. Whether or not the Leon estate’s claims prevail, enterprising climate lawyers will continue to bring state claims over extreme weather events until the Supreme Court affirms the federal government’s regulatory authority of interstate emissions. Meantime, an industry vital to the nation’s economy and security will continue to operate at the whim of left-wing state courts.” TWTW Comment: The Montana case relied on a clause in the Montana constitution claiming a right to a stable climate, which has never existed, an example of illusory rights.

A lot of fidgety thinkers hide behind acronyms and jargon. “he authors estimated a warming of 1 °C by 2100: less that what IPCC says” Might need to edit the sentence I’m quoting above. The second half is not clear to me. Why isn’t water vapor the main GHG discussed? It has large variability potenial.

August 17, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Faraday Future Faraday Future PEBBLE BEACH, Calif., Aug. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, announced that it has officially launched its transformative “EAI + Crypto” Dual-Flywheel & Dual-Bridge Ecosystem Strategy — marking the beginning of a new chapter in AI mobility and Web3 integration. This bold strategic initiative, which was revealed on August 16 at an event in Pebble Beach, integrates Embodied AI (EAI) with the explosive growth of the crypto asset economy to create a two-way, independently operating circular growth engine between Web2 and Web3, positioning FF at the forefront of the next era in global industrial and financial evolution. A replay of the announcement can be found here: https://www.ff.com/us/2025-pebble-beach/ EAI + Crypto Dual Flywheel: A New Growth Paradigm Faraday Future believes that AI represents the next great leap in productivity, while Crypto and Web3 signify a revolution in the relations of production. Together, these forces offer a potential once-in-decades opportunity for transformation — a meta-chemistry that FF aims to drive through its newly launched strategy. “The next decade could be a super long bull cycle for the crypto market,” said Ian Calderon, FF Co-Creation Officer and Founding Board Member of the California Blockchain Working Group. “FF is building a dual-engine circular growth system — combining the long-cycle, high-value EAI EV ecosystem with the short-cycle, high-velocity Crypto ecosystem. These two flywheels will empower each other, redefining what’s possible in mobility and financial innovation.” “Today's launch is a powerful example of our state's pioneering spirit, bringing together intelligent electric vehicles, blockchain, and the worlds of Web 2 and Web 3, along with industry, capital and technology,” said Fiona Ma, California State Treasurer. “This model has the potential to boost our economy, create high quality jobs, attract top tier investment, and advance sustainable development worldwide.” Building the Bridge Between Web2 and Web3 FF’s Dual-Bridge Strategy positions the Company as one of the first U.S.-listed public companies directly connecting real-world business operations with on-chain assets. Plans are underway to launch the EAI Vehicle Chain, enabling tokenized vehicle sales, crypto-based deposits, and Web3-native user engagement — while leveraging blockchain technology to create a decentralized and transparent mobility economy. “The Dual-Flywheel & Dual-Bridge Strategy reflects our deep insights into the future of the global economy,” said YT Jia, Founder & Co-CEO of Faraday Future. “FF is not just transitioning into a Web3 era — we are architecting it. This is how we deliver value creation for our stockholders.” Introducing the C10 Index and C10 Treasury: A New Crypto Infrastructure for Capital Markets FF also officially announced the C10 Index, a market-cap-weighted basket of the world’s top 10 crypto assets (excluding stablecoins), calculated from midnight Pacific Time on August 16, 2025, with a base value of 1,000. The Index will be tracked in real-time on FF.com and the FF App. Accompanying the Index, the FFAI C10 Treasury is being launched — targeting $500M to $1B in initial crypto asset purchases, subject to securing necessary funding, with an initial $30M purchase. Assets will be allocated using an 80% passive, 20% active strategy. The treasury is designed to provide sustainable returns, with staking yields estimated at 3%–5%, which can fund product innovation, potential stock buybacks, and further asset growth. FF is also exploring creating an ETF product based on the C10 Index. Crypto Flywheel to Reshape Faraday Future’s Financial Structure The Crypto Flywheel strategy, which the Company intends to operate through a wholly owned and independently managed subsidiary, FFAI Crypto Treasury and Bridging Holdings Inc., is designed to enhance FF’s income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow. With on-chain assets serving as both reserves and flexible capital, the strategy enables FF to generate stable staking yields, potentially reducing reliance on high-cost financing, and improve net asset value and structure. Structure Ensures Risk Isolation and Transparency FF’s crypto and EV businesses are planned to be operated under separate legal and financial structures to promote risk isolation, operational independence, and asset transparency. Digital assets will be held by third-party custodians and will be fully verifiable on-chain. The structure is designed to allow strategic synergies without direct cross-subsidization — while reinforcing each other. With this launch, Faraday Future offers investors access to potential dual benefits from the AI mobility and crypto asset markets. This revolutionary move supports the Company’s long-standing commitment to maximize stockholder value in a future-forward and sustainable manner.

Title: Why The ‘Buy Europe’ Trade Is About To Slam Into A Wall
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2025/08/16/why-the-buy-europe-trade-is-about-to-slam-into-a-wall/

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Remember a few months ago, when the “buy Europe” trade was red hot? Well, if you’re like me, you’re wondering where all the hype went! Now “buy America” is back on, but European markets are still sky-high—well ahead of their American cousins. That spells trouble for anyone with a portfolio that’s still tilted too much toward Europe. So today we’re going to look into where things are headed (hint: back to the US in a big way!). We’ll also delve into three funds with European exposure (two of which are closed-end funds sporting double-digit dividends) that I urge you to hold off on now. The Financial Times was one of many outlets cheerleading a shift to Europe from America back in the spring. At the time, this sentiment was driven by tariffs, seemingly overextended US tech stocks and surging US markets. “There’s all sorts of reasons to like Europe, all sorts of reasons to hate the US,” contributor Katie Martin said in an April 25 FT podcast. The buy Europe trade was working well as recently as June, when the FT again reported that “European small-caps outshine US rivals as investors bet on growth revival.” Note the phrase growth revival here: The idea was that European stocks were overlooked and would gain attention when their earnings grew. Except that didn’t happen, with European firms posting disappointing earnings, as shown in the table below (more on this in a moment). Meanwhile in the US, companies saw 9% year-over-year earnings gains in Q2, meaning their average profit growth was much higher than the best sector in Europe (financials). And if you compare the best sector in the US—communication services (see chart below), which includes firms like Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META) and Netflix (NFLX)—to its cousins in Europe, the difference is staggering. As you can see at left above, the US sector’s 40.7% earnings growth is many times greater than the best European companies can produce. Meantime, Europe’s tech and telecom companies combined can’t even muster more than 1% average growth between them. Where does that leave the European markets? Well, they’re simply not reflecting this reality. With S&P 500 benchmark SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)—in purple above—far behind the Vanguard European Stock Index Fund (VGK), in orange, as of this writing, it’s clear, based on our look at earnings, that European stocks are overbought. This makes VGK a fund to avoid. But ETFs aren’t our main focus at CEF Insider. So let’s turn to two CEFs that could face similar pressure. That, by the way, doesn’t mean these are bad funds—quite the contrary. But now is not the time to buy them, as they do have significant European holdings likely to weigh on them in the coming months. The first one is a good example of a fund I’ve liked in the past and will surely like again at some point: the abrdn Global Infrastructure Income Fund (ASGI). This fund yields a rich 11.8%, and its payout has been steady—it’s even moved up recently (though the dividend varies based on management’s assessment of the market and other factors). Moreover, the fund isn’t inherently European—in fact, it has 55% of its portfolio in US stocks, including cornerstone infrastructure players like Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC) and NextEra Energy (NEE). Still, it has 22% of its holdings in continental European stocks, plus another 2.6% in the UK. That’s enough to put a drag on the fund’s portfolio when European stocks snap back to reality. Plus there’s ASGI’s rich valuation. ASGI has been riding the enthusiasm about foreign assets, causing its discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio), which was averaging around 12% going into 2025, to evaporate. When European stocks correct, this fund will likely see a discount—and a consequent drop in its share price. Our second, and final, CEF to be wary of now is the PIMCO Income Strategy II Fund (PFN). This corporate-bond fund yields 11.5% and has held its payout steady since the pandemic days of 2021. However, as I write this, PFN trades at a 5.6% premium to NAV. And while it does have about 77% of its portfolio in the US, its largest allocations by country include European nations—France (3.2%), Spain (3%) and Germany (2.4%), to be precise—and Brazil (2.5%), which faces particularly steep tariffs from the US. To be sure, these are conservative allocations, but throw in PFN’s premium and you get a real risk of a pullback, in both the fund’s NAV and its market price, on any significant European selloff. And lower returns, especially in the fund’s NAV, could put pressure on PFN’s payout. The bottom line on all three of these funds? While geographic diversification is key for any portfolio, it’s only a matter of time until European stocks drop to reflect their meager earnings growth. Until European firms start booking bigger profits, we’re best to look elsewhere for growth. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: SoundHound’s millionaire boss founded 3 software startups before even graduating—he tells Gen Z who want to be their own boss ‘throw darts randomly’

Preston Fore is a reporter at Fortune, covering education and personal finance for the Success team. As someone who immigrated from Iran at age 17 knowing little English, becoming a tech entrepreneur one day may have seemed like a far-fetched dream. But Keyvan Mohajer always kept the mindset: You cannot hit big unless you try. And try he did. By the time he walked across the stage at the University of Toronto to receive his bachelor’s degree in engineering, Mohajer already had three software companies to his name. Each later became profitable and helped seed the voice-AI project he began in his Stanford dorm room in 2004—which evolved into SoundHound AI. Today, the AI-voice communication company is worth more than $6.5 billion and has landed deals with clients including Nvidia, Snapchat, Mercedes-Benz, and more. For Mohajer, who serves as CEO, failure has only ever served as motivation. And, it’s a lesson Gen Z eager to launch side gigs can learn from: The willingness to go out on a limb and build a company from scratch may sound intimidating—but it only takes one good idea to explode into major success. “Every attempt, you should think of it as this is the one that’s going to succeed… Don’t just throw darts randomly at the target. For every attempt, you should use everything you’ve learned from past attempts and then there will be one that’s going to get the bullseye,” Mohajer tells Fortune. Mohajer grew up always fascinated by two things: movies and robots. So, after first seeing Star Trek, he always dreamed of how to bring computerized voice systems into the real world. But only after meeting his later cofounders, James Hom and Majid Emami, during his Stanford electrical engineering doctoral program did he realize he could be part of the team to make it a reality. Their first product was simple: query by humming. Two weeks prior to Christmas, the team didn’t leave their dorm room until they could build a product that could take their database of 20,000 media files and detect what song was being hummed. But by December 24, the code was cracked.“It was on Christmas Eve that I finally hummed this Godfather soundtrack, and it told me, ‘You’re singing The Godfather,’” he said to the Iranian Students of California’s The Tale of a Success series. His pitch to investors became simple: AI-powered voice is the future. “In 20 years we will talk to computers and they will talk back to us and that will change computing.” And while it took years for SoundHound to get up off the ground, he tells Fortune finding his passion, or what makes his “heart beat faster,” has been core to his success today. “You can do things and go through life and get by and check boxes and be average,” he says. “But I really wanted to be excellent, and I wanted to push boundaries. I want to go to places others haven’t gone before, and that gave me the drive to be an entrepreneur and just push the limits and combining the two.” While SoundHound’s market performance has had dramatic ebbs and flows, the stock price is up over 200% in the past year. This is thanks in part to a better-than-expected earnings report from earlier this month; the company’s revenue is up 217% year-over-year. Its market cap is over $6.5 billion. At a time when college students are questioning the value of a degree, SoundHound’s founding story is another reminder of the innovation that often spurs across college campuses—even if it is just from cofounders meeting for the first time. Companies such as Databricks, a $62 billion data software company, as well as Google, worth over $2.4 trillion, also planted roots in college. Both sets of founders met on Stanford’s campus. But there perhaps is no more famous company that spurred from the college experience than Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg met his cofounders, Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes at Harvard University and built the foundation of the social platform now known as Meta (now worth nearly $2 trillion). The billionaire returned to his alma mater in 2017 and said he never expected to be such an entrepreneurial success story. “The thing is, it never even occurred to me that someone might be us,” Zuckerberg said. “We were just college kids. We didn’t know anything about that. There were all these big technology companies with resources. I just assumed one of them would do it.” “We’ve all started lifelong friendships here, and some of us even families,” he added. “That’s why I’m so grateful to this place. Thanks, Harvard.” Editor’s note, Aug. 16, 2025: This article has been updated to clarify a quote from CEO Keyvan Mohajer, who misspoke earlier. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.
