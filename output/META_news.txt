Will the bull market continue into 2025? Happy New Year, all. My overall macro theme for 2024 was An Expansion of the Rally. The theme ultimately proved to be accurate, as the dominance of the Magnificent 7 stocks (Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.com, Alphabet, Tesla and Meta Platforms) dissipated during the second half of the year as the other “Not So Magnificent 493” stocks (i.e., the remaining stocks of the S&P 500 Index) took over the leadership role. The Magnificent 7 accounted for 62% of the total return of the S&P 500 in 2023, and 59% during the first0 half of 2024, but just 9.2% during the third quarter of 2024. This passing of the baton is important, healthy and constructive for the continuation of the current bull market run, which is now over two years old, with a cumulative return of 74.2% as of November 29, 2024. For perspective on this front, prior to the current bull market, according to data from Yardeni Research and Yahoo! Finance, there have been 12 bull markets since 1946 and the average duration of those bull markets was 5.3 years, with an average cumulative return of 177.5%. Of course, this time could be different, and past performance is not indicative of future results. Stock market leadership was not the only significant transition that took place in 2024. The U.S. election concluded with a transition in the White House and Senate as the Republicans now control all three legs of the federal government stool, given that they also maintained control of the House of Representatives. Time will tell what this transition will mean in terms of policy implementations and their impacts on economic and stock market growth. The Federal Reserve also transitioned from an inflation-fighting, higher interest rate environment to the beginning stages of what will likely be a multi-year rate-cutting campaign. They kicked off the campaign with 100 bp (1%) in rate cuts towards the latter stages of 2024. According to the Fed's final 2024 release of their infamous "Dot Plot" chart in December, they are forecasting another 50 bp (0.50%) in rate cuts in 2025 and 50 bp (0.50%) in rate cuts in 2026. The Fed is also forecasting inflation, as measured by Core PCE, to decrease to 2.5% in 2025 and then decrease further to 2.2% in 2026. As a result, I see the theme for 2025 as Growth Opportunities Ahead. This theme does not imply that all areas of the market will move higher in the new year because they likely will not. It also does not mean the economy will experience exponential growth because it likely will not. Finally, it does not imply that periods of short-term bouts of volatility will not happen, as they likely will, given current valuations and the many geopolitical and central bank uncertainties that lie ahead. What it does suggest, however, is that the next four years will undoubtedly look very different than the prior four years, and the next decade will look very different than the last decade. Over the shorter term, the outlook for lower interest rates and inflation, coupled with expected economic growth and stability under a Trump Administration (with the support of Congress), provides tailwinds for potential growth opportunities in both equities and fixed income. However, while I see numerous growth opportunities ahead in 2025, investors would be wise to be selective as growth will likely be less than what the stock market experienced in the prior two years and more pronounced in certain areas of the market than others. Some of these areas are highlighted below. 1. Bull Market and Earnings Growth Expansion: For the breadth of the bull market to continue to expand, the breadth of the earnings rally also needs to expand. Fortunately, both of these expansions began during the second half of 2024, and I believe that the momentum will carry forward through 2025. In terms of earnings growth, according to FactSet, the per-share operating earnings growth pace for the overall S&P 500 Index is currently forecasted at 15%. As a result, expanding beyond, but not necessarily abandoning, U.S. large-cap stocks is worthy of consideration for the new year. Expansion candidates would include U.S. mid-cap, U.S. small-cap and international stocks (predominantly international developed market stocks) that pay attractive dividends, have a history of price performance, and are poised for total return potential ahead. 2. The Long Game of Artificial Intelligence Investing: In terms of where we are in the timeline of artificial intelligence (AI), I believe that we are just in batting practice of a double-header with so many more opportunities that lie ahead in the development and application of AI. According to Faist, as of June 11, 2024, the global AI market is expected to reach $1.81 trillion by 2030, with a 36.6% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). However, investors and companies need to be patient with their investments in this revolutionary technology, as some may not necessarily see a return on their investment for years to come. As I see it, the AI revolution road is a long one with many potholes that will create many winners and many losers. As a result, as opposed to just trying to find the next Nvidia or hot chips/semiconductor company, investors should consider potential investment opportunities in the entire AI Ecosystem, which is comprised of data centers, software, hardware and chips/semiconductors. Data centers and their associated tremendous need for power and cooling solutions, in particular, have become a critical component of the AI ecosystem. 3. Increased Investment in Defense and Security: U.S. defense and national security needs to focus on replenishment, upgrades and modernization, addressing gaps in naval readiness, advancing missile defense systems highlighted by recent conflicts, and integrating cutting-edge technologies like autonomous systems (i.e. drones) to meet evolving global threats. Fortunately, more spending is on the way as defense spending in the United States is predicted to increase every year over the next decade, totaling approximately $1.1 trillion in 2034–that represents an increase of over 20% vs. 2023 and 263% vs. 2000, according to Statista Research Department as of July 5, 2024. Companies that play a pivotal role in areas such as enhancing military readiness, advancing missile defense systems, and driving technological innovation in autonomous and defense technologies stand to benefit from the increases in investment and spending in these areas. 4. Fed Adopts More Gradual Pace toward Interest Rate Cuts: According to its updated Dot Plot chart (see below), the Fed is currently forecasting 50 bp in additional rate cuts in 2025 and another 50 bp in rate cuts in 2026. All this would follow the 100 bp in rate cuts that the Fed enacted during the latter stages of 2024. These cuts align with their long-run neutral rate expectation of around 3.0%. In terms of the pace of their cuts, I believe that the Fed will adopt a more gradual pace of easing in 2025 and 2026 with no single rate cuts of greater than 25 bp until the Fed Funds Target Rate is closer to their long-run neutral rate expectation of 3% (which may not be achieved by the end of 2026), given the many uncertainties surrounding the labor market, inflation, potential tariffs, and the policies to be implemented by the incoming administration. Regardless of the pace and extent of this rate-cutting campaign, it has become abundantly clear that interest rates will be lower in 2025 and over the next two years. As a result, investing in areas of the market likely to benefit from a declining interest rate environment is worthy of consideration. These areas may include, but are not limited to, certain sectors of equities, such as healthcare, information technology, consumer staples, financials, communication services and consumer discretionary, as well as bonds of different credit qualities, with an overweight towards investment grade. Federal Reserve "Dot Plot" Chart as of December 18, 2024 FOMC Dot Plot Chart December 18, 2024 5. Large Cap Pharma Turns to Small Cap Biotech for Answers: Large-cap pharmaceutical companies face multiple headwinds as they continue to have their profit margins pressured by Washington D.C.'s push to lower drug prices and larger revenue-producing drugs that have come off patent or are scheduled to see come off patent and be challenged by lower generic drug prices. One answer to their revenue quandary can be found in the innovative healthcare solutions being developed by smaller-cap biotech firms. These innovative healthcare solutions, which are now being assisted by artificial intelligence developments in certain cases, include but are not limited to gene therapies, RNA therapeutics, precision and target oncology treatments such as CAR-T cell therapies, and, of course, obesity drug breakthroughs such as GLP-1. In 2024, according to BioPharma Drive, as of November 26, there were 36 Biotech M&A transactions totaling just over $45 billion, the latter well below expectations coming into the year as many of the deals involved smaller companies. However, the average premium paid for the 36 transactions in 2024 was an impressive 83%. Looking ahead to 2025, many analysts are optimistic that the total number and total money amount of biotech-related M&A transactions will increase. To this end, PwC, in its "Pharmaceutical and life sciences: U.S. Deals 2025 outlook," expects transactions between $5 billion and $15 billion to see sustained activity in 2025 while recognizing geopolitical factors that could bring headwinds. Investors thus need to find those smaller-cap biotech companies with existing breakthroughs or innovative drugs in the FDA approval pipeline that large-cap pharmaceutical companies desire to add to their platforms and thus have the greatest chance of being acquired. Small-and mid-cap biotech companies with strong pipelines and focused therapies, such as rare diseases, RNA-based therapies or advanced immunology, according to Biopharma Boardroom, appear to have the most appeal to potential large-cap pharmaceutical acquirers in the current environment. Looking for those companies with related drugs in Phase II or Phase III of the FDA approval process is a good starting point for identifying potential investment opportunities. 6. Munis Poised to Perform: Tax free income is always attractive to income-oriented investors, particularly investors in higher tax brackets. I anticipate this level of attraction being heightened in 2025. Heading into the new year, the balance sheets of many local and state governments are relatively strong, and the positive outlook for employment and the economy in 2025 should bode well for the tax revenues of many municipalities. Additionally, comparable yields of municipal bonds are currently and should remain, very attractive to investors. According to data from Schwab* as of December 3. 2024, the tax-equivalent yield of munis for an investor in the top tax bracket is near its high over the past 15 years. Concerns over the potential repeal of the municipal bond exemption appear now to be overblown, setting the stage for what could be a high level of demand for municipal bonds and municipal bond-oriented strategies in the new year. Lower short-term interest rates should also benefit municipal closed-end fund (CEF) strategies that employ leverage, many of which are still trading at a discount to their net asset values (NAVs). 7. Financials (including Regional Banks) Rebound: Many of the factors that led to the regional banking crisis and ensuing hangover have seemingly abated as short-term interest rates have declined (and are forecasted to decline further), the prices of U.S. Treasurys have increased, and the prospects for more economic growth and less regulation have increased following the election of Donald Trump. Less regulation and lower potential capital requirements could also lead to great industry consolidation via an increase in mergers and acquisitions (M&A). To this end, Piper Sandler analyst Mark Fitzgibbon said in a Banking Dive article that he expects 2025 and 2026 to see robust bank M&A activity and that deal approvals, under a Trump administration, will speed up markedly and the process will be more clearly delineated. Regional banks rebounded during the latter half of 2024. I believe that the rebound will extend, and more potential upside remains for certain regional banks in 2025. 8. Preferreds Benefit from Financials Rebound and Lower Interest Rates: Preferred securities represent ownership in a corporation and have both bond and stock-like features. Preferreds generally pay a fixed income, have a par value, hold a credit rating, and trade on major exchanges. They also typically have a higher stated dividend payout than the corporation's common shares and even bonds. Despite these features, they are often not considered by investors to help meet their respective income and growth needs, and perhaps they should be. Preferreds did suffer a pullback following the regional bank crisis that began back in March 2023 with the seizure of Silicon Valley Bank, given that banks are typically the largest issuer of preferred securities and contagion risk was at the forefront of many investors' mindsets. However, as discussed earlier, many of the factors that led to the regional banking crisis have now dissipated, creating attractive entry points for many preferred securities that have not yet fully recovered from the pullback and potential total return opportunities ahead. 9. Look to Sources of Power to Help Power Your Returns: Data centers are forecasted to use up to 9% of total electricity generated in the United States by the end of the decade, more than doubling their current consumption, according to Reuters as of May 29, 2024. Electricity is stretched in the U.S., and our electricity grid is antiquated and unreliable. As a result, the data centers that serve as the nervous system of the AI ecosystem will need to look beyond traditional energy sources, such as electricity, and alternative sources of energy, such as natural gas and nuclear energy, to help provide the massive amount of power they need. As it relates to natural gas, S&P Global Ratings estimates that U.S. data centers' increasing energy demands will lead to additional gas demand of between 3 billion and 6 billion cubic feet per day by 2030, from a starting point of almost none today. As it relates to nuclear energy, Goldman Sachs believes that we are in the early stages of a nuclear renaissance in the U.S. and globally as it relates to data center power demand in the form of small modular reactors (SMRs) and larger-scale nuclear power plants. Companies that provide products or services in these areas stand to benefit from all of this anticipated demand for power in the new year. 10. Expect More Short-Term Bouts of Volatility but Don't Abandon Stocks: In 2024, as of December 2, there were only 16 days where the S&P 500 Index moved by more than 1.5% in a given trading day–and 7 of those 16 days were positive moves! This amount translates to just 3% of the trading days involving a downside move of 1.5% or more, representing a historically low level of volatility and should not be expected to continue throughout 2025. The S&P 500 also saw 54 record closes in 2024, as of December 2, so valuations are rich, and smaller-scale corrections are possible. These corrections, of course, can be met by money coming off the sidelines to take advantage of more attractive entry points. The potential for more volatility in 2025 does not mean that investors should try to time the market, as timing the market is often an exercise in futility, and "staying on the sidelines" for too long can have a negative impact on achieving longer-term financial goals. Rather, a more balanced approach towards stock market positioning, perhaps through equal-weighted strategies, covered calls, or more defensive stocks, may be worthy of consideration for certain investors and/or portions of their overall portfolios. Best wishes for a productive and successful 2025! * Source: Schwab, Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index, as of 12/3/2024.

UPDATED 13:04 EST / DECEMBER 20 2024 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof The bottomless pit of funding for all things artificial intelligence remains… bottomless. Case in point: This week Databricks raised more money than God. That’s going to be one monster IPO next year (maybe) if the economy holds up. Meanwhile, Perplexity raised $500 million for its AI search and immediately bought AI startup Carbon. And continuing the AI funding bubble boom, Sandbox AQ raised $300 million. But the business is real, as AI is expected to drive enterprise tech upside next year. The bubble boom in AI models is continuing too, as Google, OpenAI, Nvidia, Meta and others all released new models and ways to use and access them. Salesforce also beefed up its just recently introduced AI agent platform Agentforce. But OpenAI faces legal headwinds as Elon Musk and Meta both opposed its plans to create a for-profit company. Neobank Chime filed confidentially for an initial public offering next year, following ServiceTitan’s IPO last week. Is a thawing in the works this winter? Dave Vellante and David Floyer have a plan to revive Intel’s chip foundry business, but it’s going to take a lot of cooperation by some powerful companies and the government. Cyber consolidation keeps chugging along, as Arctic Wolf bought BlackBerry’s Cylance unit and Cisco bought SnapAttack. Elsewhere in technology, TikTok’s bid to survive in the U.S. will go to the Supreme Court next month. Your guess as to what the Supremes will do is as good as mine. You can hear more about this and other news on John Furrier’s and Dave Vellante’s weekly podcast theCUBE Pod out today on YouTube.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / DECEMBER 20 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood.

Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love.

In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade.

Title: Nvidia stock rebounds after broad market rout as analysts stay bullish on outlook

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia stock (NVDA) jumped as much as 2.7% early Thursday as Wall Street analysts reiterated their Buy ratings on the stock despite concerns about rising competition and the possibility that artificial intelligence chip demand could wane. Over the past few days, Wall Street analysts at Bernstein, TD Cowen, Morgan Stanley, and Truist have maintained bullish outlooks on the company. “All relevant industry contacts support the dominance and superiority of NVDA's full technology stack,” Truist Securities’ William Stein wrote on Monday. He raised his price target on the stock to $204 from $169. Following the nods from Wall Street, Nvidia shares rallied as much as 4.8% Wednesday. But the stock later reversed direction, ending the day down roughly 1%, as stocks fell across the board following commentary from the Federal Reserve projecting fewer rate cuts and stickier inflation in 2025. Even with Thursday's early morning gain, Nvidia stock is still off roughly 11% from its record close of $148.88 in early November. Nvidia shares have fallen as investors worry its GPUs could lose share in the broader AI chip market given that its customers are developing their own custom chips. Google (GOOG) and Meta (META) have developed chips with Broadcom (AVGO). Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA), and Amazon (AMZN) also make their own custom chips. Broadcom’s announcement that it’s developing chips for two more clients, who are believed to be ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and Apple (AAPL), boosted the chipmaker’s stock last week and sent Nvidia’s in the opposite direction. These custom chips, called ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), could potentially threaten Nvidia’s GPUs, given that they are cheaper and tailored to a tech company’s specific AI needs. A Morgan Stanley report released on Dec. 15 showed that custom chips used to run cloud AI services could grow their share of the overall AI chip market from 11% in 2024 to 15% in 2030. Still, Morgan Stanley said, “history is certainly on Nvidia's side” when it comes to maintaining dominance of the AI chip market. “We think ASICs have continued to improve, but Nvidia's strong execution continues to raise the bar for its competitors." It's a point on Nvidia that Bank of America semiconductor analyst Vivek Arya reiterated Wednesday in an episode of the Opening Bid podcast (video above). Additionally, concerns loom that the Big Tech spending on AI chips that fueled Nvidia's rise could slow down. Commentary from Microsoft and Google in their most recent earnings reports indicated that their AI spending will grow at a slower pace in the future. And there are concerns that AI models are no longer improving at their previous breakneck pace, which could also put a damper on investment. TD Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter said the firm's recent meeting with Nvidia showed the chipmaker is aware of that concern but "remains confident in the industry's ability to progress and continue to innovate." Stein also believes Nvidia will announce a standalone CPU, or central processing unit — the “brain” of a computer, distinct from Nvidia’s Hopper and Blackwell GPUs, or graphics processing units — in 2025, opening up what he sees as a $35 billion market opportunity. Nvidia currently uses its Arm-based Grace CPUs alongside its Blackwell GPUs in servers it sells to customers but does not sell CPUs individually. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Title: Dendias and the military camps, the donors and… poor Loukas, the registrar’s anxiety, and the new investor in Athens hotels

Time Published: 2024-12-19T09:32:19Z
Full Content:
Hello there! With the holiday season upon us, it seems the Christmas spirit is spreading, and the idea of goodwill is more prominent than ever. Let me begin with an event that took place yesterday at the Ministry of National Defense. Thanasis Laskaridis and his family laid the foundation for the new building of the Special Cyber Unit of the Hellenic National Defense General Staff (GEETHA), which will be constructed thanks to a donation by the “Athanasios C. Laskaridis Foundation,” named after him. The modest ceremony was attended by Minister Nikos Dendias, Deputy Minister Yiannis Kefalogiannis, the host, GEETHA Chief General Dimitris Choupis, and a select few distinguished guests, including U.S. Ambassador George Tsounis and Chania MP Sevi Voloudaki. Minister Dendias expressed his gratitude for the donation, noting that last year, donations to the Ministry of Defense amounted to €234,000, while this year they soared to €26 million. Interesting, right? But even more striking was the closing remark of the donor, Thanasis Laskaridis, which I’ll quote verbatim: “After all, as the popular song says, dedicated to poor Loukas, we won’t take a single penny to the grave. It’s good, then, for those whom God has blessed with some surplus to do something to help our homeland. It’s time for all of us to get rid of the ‘crabs in our pockets’ and do whatever we can, whatever is necessary.” Dendias’ Commentary and Military Camp Rumors During the same event, Dendias couldn’t avoid questions from those present about the well-known issue (regarding the President of the Republic), jokingly responding, “Well, I’m probably the last person who could comment on this matter,” which, of course, has been settled for a while now—if it was ever truly open. On the other hand, the Minister was much more talkative about efforts to modernize military camps, making sure to throw in a jab about the sparse rumors suggesting that the areas formerly used as camps will be turned into business ventures. “When someone wants to slander another person or initiative, they immediately turn it into a story about interests and that’s the end of it,” he remarked. The Registrar’s Anxiety (Which Has Ended) Over Pavlos Possibly today—or at the latest tomorrow—the former royal family will take action regarding their citizenship. Whether their lawyer will show up, as happened with Michel de Grèce, or Pavlos himself will make an appearance, I can’t say for sure. However, what I can say is that yesterday at the Athens Registry Office, there was quite a commotion, with phones ringing off the hook as employees scrambled to handle all the technical details of the forthcoming request. This was complicated by the fact that certain procedures have been digitized since the Venizelos law. After all, it’s not every day that the former royal family gets added to the records. I hear that written instructions were issued yesterday by the Ministry of the Interior to ensure everything goes smoothly when the request is made. The process is simple: the request is submitted, the Registry Office forwards it to the Ministry of the Interior along with the required documents, and the Ministry determines whether the applicant can be registered or not. That’s what we reported this morning. Eventually, at 11 a.m., it was confirmed that Pavlos and Nikolaos submitted the relevant application at the Athens Registry Office through their proxy lawyer. The surname they chose is “De Grèce,” and a total of 10 members of the former royal family have signed the application. Elections in the Regional Unions It’s a day of decisions for the Union of Greek Regions, as today the successor to Tzitzikostas will be chosen. The role is expected to go to the governor of the South Aegean, Giorgos Hatzimarkos. Following Nikos Hardalias’ announcement that he is withdrawing from the Presidency, the first vice-presidency is set to go to the governor of Crete, Stavros Arnaoutakis, and the second vice-presidency to the governor of the Peloponnese, Dimitris Ptochos. 5% Decrease in Abstention Due to Electoral Roll Cleanup The Ministry of the Interior has received very few applications to reverse deletions from the electoral rolls. This means that in the next national elections, the number of registered voters will be approximately 440,000 fewer. These are individuals aged 80 and above who have had no physical presence in the country or have passed away but had not been removed from the rolls until now due to unreported deaths to the relevant Greek authorities. These individuals contribute to the abstention rates, inflating them by about 5%. Parliament’s New Year Under the Shadow of Presidential Speculation Parliament will suspend its work tonight for the holiday season and is expected to reopen on January 8. Don’t ask me about the legislative agenda because I estimate that the only topic occupying the political and journalistic scene will be the individual proposed by Kyriakos Mitsotakis for the position of President of the Republic. The Prime Minister stated in his interview with ERT that he would reveal the name within the second half of January, triggering another wave of speculation. The official process is expected to commence in Parliament in early February 2025. According to the Constitution, the absolute deadline for the first vote is February 13, one month before the end of Katerina Sakellaropoulou’s term. The first vote requires a majority of 200 MPs; the same threshold applies for the second vote, which takes place five days later. The third vote lowers the threshold to 180 MPs, the fourth to 151 MPs, and, finally, the fifth requires only a relative majority. Poor Anagnostopoulos, what a fate you’ve met After the €5.5 million fines issued yesterday to eight multinational companies, and with more likely to follow for retail chains, no one would want to be in the shoes of the General Secretary of Commerce and Consumer Protection, S. Anagnostopoulos. The General Secretary has been invited tomorrow, Friday, to speak at an internal event of SELPE, the association of major retail chains. The big retail chains are up in arms over the fines, as they believe that the system implemented by the ministry is intentionally convoluted and complex, aimed at imposing fines they deem to serve public relations purposes. So tomorrow, Anagnostopoulos is expected to face heavy pressure as they demand clear rules. Meanwhile, note that a total of 26 companies—multinationals, food manufacturers, and other consumer goods firms, as well as supermarket chains—are under investigation to determine if they comply with the law on profit margin caps. Yesterday’s announcements involved eight companies, so expect more to come in the next few days. The last law passed by Parliament for 2024 extends the validity of the law on “caps on gross profit margins for all products essential for consumer nutrition and dignified living” until April 2025. For now, the government’s intention—provided market conditions stabilize—is not to extend the measure further beyond April, but I wouldn’t bet on it. Hotels: A new investor for Attica Banks are aiming to increase their financing and are closely monitoring tenders and other processes for the sale of European banks’ maritime loan portfolios. Piraeus Bank has taken a significant step by providing over €100 million in financing following a competitive process to the Cypriot Thanos Resort & Hotels, owned by Thanos Michaelides. Michaelides plans to expand his presence in Greece’s hotel sector. The group, which includes the Anassa in Paphos, intends to invest in Attica and Milos. The race to break the €4 barrier Speaking of Piraeus Bank, its stock is once again approaching the €4 mark—the level at which a placement was made last March for 27% of the share capital. Since then, the stock has only managed to stay above this level for three trading sessions, closing at the same price on three other occasions, with an intraday high of €4.08. Yesterday it closed at €3.91, showing an inclination to move toward €4. However, there’s often a gap between intention and reality. We’ll see if the stock gets closer to the generous target prices given by analysts, which range from €5 (Deutsche Bank), €5.90 (JPM), and even €6.31 (Eurobank Equities). Salary increases at SEV The new president of SEV (Hellenic Federation of Enterprises), Spyros Theodoropoulos, brings extensive experience in business transformations and restructuring. He’s undertaking a similar effort at SEV, implementing a new organizational chart and redistributing responsibilities. The goal is to bring SEV’s members closer to society and to activate all members of the Board of Directors and Executive Committee in SEV’s daily operations. This ambitious effort demands considerable work from SEV’s 60 employees, which is why one of the new administration’s first decisions was to significantly increase their salaries. Manousakis’ term at ADMIE renewed Last night, ADMIE Holdings sent a letter to the Chinese State Grid announcing the renewal of the term of ADMIE SA’s Chairman and CEO, Manos Manousakis. The term has been renewed for four years. The Board of Directors will meet tomorrow, Friday, to approve the renewal. €110 million investments in clean energy storage Staying in the energy sector, Deputy Energy Minister Alexandra Sdoukou met yesterday with representatives of 15 companies selected in the first two energy storage tenders. The government aims to expedite the construction of energy storage stations, offering operational support and investment aid. Investors, who collectively are investing €110 million in lithium battery energy storage systems, highlighted key issues they face, primarily the need for new connection infrastructure, such as the development or expansion of substations and networks. These processes are often delayed due to lengthy equipment procurement timelines. Additionally, delays in licensing procedures that impact overall project progress were also discussed. Sdoukou pledged to support each case individually, announcing the creation of a special coordination team. This team will work closely with ADMIE, RAE, and DAPEEP to resolve all licensing and technical issues. Timely project completion is critical, as they are funded by the Recovery Fund under strict deadlines. Let’s see if anything gets done! Lavipharm’s Investment Lavipharm’s new investment in transdermal drug production is set to launch in early 2025. The modifications and expansion of part of the production facilities in Paiania have already been completed, and the mechanical equipment is arriving in Greece in the coming period. This investment is a cornerstone of the pharmaceutical company’s business plan, as it will double its transdermal production capacity, while the addition of the new production line ensures uninterrupted manufacturing. Over the past five years, Lavipharm has achieved a 55% increase in its market share, and its management has stated that it is exploring opportunities for new drug acquisitions while also making new moves focused on pharmaceutical production. Alumil’s “Trump Trade” Alumil, led by G. Mylonas, is steadily moving towards a market capitalization of €150 million. Its stock, now at €4.59, is 58.2% higher than three months ago. After struggling through the tough years of 2013–2022 and eventually reaching an agreement with banks and servicers to handle its heavy debt load, Alumil is beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel. The next step is to spin off its casting division and sell 70% of the new company (Alufond) to a foreign investor. G. Mylonas, encouraged by Trump’s election, has turned his gaze across the Atlantic, aiming to finalize the deal within the first quarter of 2025. Even if it slips to the second quarter, it’s no big deal—after all, in the market, you hear a lot of talk but see little action. Window Dressing Next week, the Athens Stock Exchange will remain closed on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and the day after. Opportunities for short-term investment strategies are extremely limited. The primary goal of window dressing remains a top priority. As previously mentioned, Piraeus Bank aims to bridge the gap to the €4 placement level (yesterday it closed at €3.91, up +1.79%) so that those who invested at that time don’t end the year in the red. Similarly, National Bank has risen to €7.70 (+1.45%), Athens International Airport to €8, Cenergy to €9.25, and so on. By Tuesday, December 31, everyone will close their books with satisfaction and present the results of their efforts to shareholders, investors, and stakeholders. These movements, coupled with the lack of large-scale strategic placements, have brought the General Index to 1,455.67 points, with a modest increase of +0.2%. While trading volume may appear higher, it isn’t—of the €155.3 million total, €57.1 million came from a large Eurobank package and several smaller ones, leaving €85 million in stock trades on the board. Once again, Coca-Cola HBC, typically the General Index’s reliable supporter, remained at €32.80 (-1.5%), leaving OPAP (+2.21% at €15.74) and Motor Oil (+1.38%) to take over its role. Meanwhile, a consistent seller is holding PPC at €11.70, despite analysts’ glowing reports making headlines. Nuclear Energy and Artificial Intelligence: Parallel Paths Yesterday, Meta published an RFP (Request for Proposals) seeking a provider for a nuclear energy installation of up to 4 gigawatts to meet the growing energy demands of its data centers. This move reflects a broader trend in the artificial intelligence industry, where the exponential growth in computational requirements is creating unprecedented demand for stable and reliable energy. Meta’s strategy to place nuclear plants near its data centers aims to minimize energy transmission losses. Given that Meta is already the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the U.S., with 6.7 GW in operation, this step marks a new era where nuclear energy suddenly emerges as a key pillar for the growth of artificial intelligence.

Archives An intensification of surface Earth’s energy imbalance since the late 20th century, Li et al., Communications Earth & Environment: Tracking the energy balance of the Earth system is a key method for studying the contribution of human activities to climate change. However, accurately estimating the surface energy balance has long been a challenge, primarily due to uncertainties that dwarf the energy flux changes induced and a lack of precise observational data at the surface. We have employed the Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) method, integrating it with recent developments in surface solar radiation observational data, to refine the ensemble of CMIP6 model outputs. This has resulted in an enhanced estimation of Surface Earth System Energy Imbalance (EEI) changes since the late 19th century. Our findings show that CMIP6 model outputs, constrained by this observational data, reflect changes in energy imbalance consistent with observations in Ocean Heat Content (OHC), offering a narrower uncertainty range at the 95% confidence level than previous estimates. Observing the EEI series, dominated by changes due to external forcing, we note a relative stability (0.22 Wm−2) over the past half-century, but with a intensification (reaching 0.80 Wm−2) in the mid to late 1990s, indicating an escalation in the adverse impacts of global warming and climate change, which provides another independent confirmation of what recent studies have shown. Fusion of Probabilistic Projections of Sea-Level Rise, Grandey et al., Earth's Future: A probabilistic projection of sea-level rise uses a probability distribution to represent scientific uncertainty. However, alternative probabilistic projections of sea-level rise differ markedly, revealing ambiguity, which poses a challenge to scientific assessment and decision-making. To address the challenge of ambiguity, we propose a new approach to quantify a best estimate of the scientific uncertainty associated with sea-level rise. Our proposed fusion combines the complementary strengths of the ice sheet models and expert elicitations that were used in the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Under a low-emissions scenario, the fusion's very likely range (5th–95th percentiles) of global mean sea-level rise is 0.3–1.0 m by 2100. Under a high-emissions scenario, the very likely range is 0.5–1.9 m. The 95th percentile projection of 1.9 m can inform a high-end storyline, supporting decision-making for activities with low uncertainty tolerance. By quantifying a best estimate of scientific uncertainty, the fusion caters to diverse users. Earth's Climate History Explains Life's Temperature Optima, Schipper et al., Ecology and Evolution: Why does the growth of most life forms exhibit a narrow range of optimal temperatures below 40°C? We hypothesize that the recently identified stable range of oceanic temperatures of ~5 to 37°C for more than two billion years of Earth history tightly constrained the evolution of prokaryotic thermal performance curves to optimal temperatures for growth to less than 40°C. We tested whether competitive mechanisms reproduced the observed upper limits of life's temperature optima using simple Lotka–Volterra models of interspecific competition between organisms with different temperature optima. Model results supported our proposition whereby organisms with temperature optima up to 37°C were most competitive. Model results were highly robust to a wide range of reasonable variations in temperature response curves of modeled species. We further propose that inheritance of prokaryotic genes and subsequent co-evolution with microbial partners may have resulted in eukaryotes also fixing their temperature optima within this narrow temperature range. We hope this hypothesis will motivate considerable discussion and future work to advance our understanding of the remarkable consistency of the temperature dependence of life. Widespread outdoor exposure to uncompensable heat stress with warming, Fan & McColl, Communications Earth & Environment: Previous studies projected an increasing risk of uncompensable heat stress indoors in a warming climate. However, little is known about the timing and extent of this risk for those engaged in essential outdoor activities, such as water collection and farming. Here, we employ a physically-based human energy balance model, which considers radiative, wind, and key physiological effects, to project global risk of uncompensable heat stress outdoors using bias-corrected climate model outputs. Focusing on farmers (approximately 850 million people), our model shows that an ensemble median 2.8% (15%) would be subject to several days of uncompensable heat stress yearly at 2 (4) °C of warming relative to preindustrial. Focusing on people who must walk outside to access drinking water (approximately 700 million people), 3.4% (23%) would be impacted at 2 (4) °C of warming. Outdoor work would need to be completed at night or in the early morning during these events. ["uncompensable" means physiologically intolerable, acutely dangerous, ultimately deadly] Stabilising CO2 concentration as a channel for global disaster risk mitigation, Lu & Tambakis, Scientific Report: We investigate the influence of anthropogenic CO2 concentration fluctuations on the likelihood of climate-related disasters. We calibrate annual incidence rates against global disasters and CO2 growth spanning from 1960 to 2022 based on a dynamic panel logit model. We also study the sensitivity of disaster incidence to stochastic carbon dynamics consistent with IPCC-projected climate outcomes for 2100. The key insight is that present and lagged CO2 growth contains valuable information about the likelihood of future disaster events. We further show that lowering carbon stock uncertainty by dampening the persistence or the variability of CO2 concentration has a first-order impact on mitigating expected disaster risk. Fact-checking information from large language models can decrease headline discernment, DeVerna et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences: This study explores how large language models (LLMs) used for fact-checking affect the perception and dissemination of political news headlines. Despite the growing adoption of AI and tests of its ability to counter online misinformation, little is known about how people respond to LLM-driven fact-checking. This experiment reveals that even LLMs that accurately identify false headlines do not necessarily enhance users’ abilities to discern headline accuracy or promote accurate news sharing. LLM fact checks can actually reduce belief in true news wrongly labeled as false and increase belief in dubious headlines when the AI is unsure about an article’s veracity. These findings underscore the need for research on AI fact-checking’s unintended consequences, informing policies to enhance information integrity in the digital age. Droughts in Wind and Solar Power: Assessing Climate Model Simulations for a Net-Zero Energy Future, Liu et al., Geophysical Research Letters: Understanding and predicting “droughts” in wind and solar power availability can help the electric grid operator planning and operation toward deep renewable penetration. We assess climate models' ability to simulate these droughts at different horizontal resolutions, ∼100 and ∼25 km, over Western North America and Texas. We find that these power droughts are associated with the high/low pressure systems. The simulated wind and solar power variabilities and their corresponding droughts during historical periods are more sensitive to the model bias than to the model resolution. Future climate simulations reveal varied future change of these droughts across different regions. Although model resolution does not affect the simulation of historical droughts, it does impact the simulated future changes. This suggests that regional response to future warming can vary considerably in high- and low-resolution models. These insights have important implications for adapting power system planning and operations to the changing climate.

One-off paid access fees are generally astronomically priced, suitable for such as "On a Heuristic Point of View Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light" but not as a gamble on unknowns. With a median world income of US$ 9,373, for most of us US$ 42 is significant money to wager on an article's relevance and importance. Most articles appearing here are found via RSS feeds from journal publishers, filtered by search terms to produce raw output for assessment of relevance. Relevant articles are then queried against the Unpaywall database, to identify open access articles and expose useful metadata for articles appearing in the database. The objective of New Research isn't to cast a tinge on scientific results, to color readers' impressions. Hence candidate articles are assessed via two metrics only: A few journals offer public access to "preprint" versions of articles for which the review process is not yet complete. For some key journals this all the mention we'll see in RSS feeds, so we include such items in New Research. These are flagged as "preprint." The section "Informed opinion, nudges & major initiatives" includes some items that are not scientific research per se but fall instead into the category of "perspectives," observations of implications of research findings, areas needing attention, etc. Please let us know if you're aware of an article you think may be of interest for Skeptical Science research news, or if we've missed something that may be important. Send your input to Skeptical Science via our contact form. A list of journals we cover may be found here.

Introduction to Bitcoin Lecture Video Super pumped to share with you, my first full length lecture on an introduction to bitcoin, the bitcoin Revolution, and also this edited transcript that I provided for you! What to become: STOIC VLOG Something I have been meaning to write or create or do is like some sort of book, ebook, pamphlet, or introductory primer to stoicism. I really think that stoicism is probably one of the most useful and philosophical models to live normal every day real life. Yet, I haven’t really found a good instructional guide on it, especially when I was self teaching it to myself. Consider this a practical primer, cutting through the BS: Stoicism, stoic, the stoa in ancient Greece– essentially the stoa was like some sort of portico, patio, pillar, outside, essentially a spot where guys would just hang out, talk shop, talk philosophy, etc. ￼ ￼ I think about the show “Hey Arnold” in which I was raised with… the notion of “stoop kid“, the notion of a stoop is that in a lot of cities, especially the east coast in New York, you have this little stoop or porch, stairs that go outside your front door… and you could just hang out there, engage in social and neighborhood life etc. One of my happiest moments was when I was living in Providence Rhode Island, and then COVID-19 hit. Everything was closed, besides the park. I can still go to the park, hang out, workout, do chin ups– I learned how to do muscle ups, more bodyweight calisthenics stuff, and also… I had a lot of fun with this “rock toss“ challenge and workout… in the middle of the park was a huge ass rock and huge ass stone, and every single day I would go there pick it up, and then eventually work out with it; throwing it around for fun, doing overhead presses with it, clean and jerks, squats, and eventually I would just throw it around for fun. Funny enough it might have been the most fit I was in my life… this was the true “functional” fitness. The inspiration — Hector lifting an insanely massive stone (barely 2 strong men could lift it)… using it to break down the door of the ships of the other side. Anyways, the reason why that period of covid was so good is that it was in the middle of beautiful Providence Rhode Island summer, so nice and bright and warm and lovely… and one of the good things was going to the park was like an open forum, a new anatheum for a lot of really cool guys to come, hang out, talk shop, go topless and shirtless, workout and hang out. I met some really interesting people during that period of time. I met some guys who were really cool. For example, one guy I met was in the US military Navy, I think he was training to be a Navy seal or Delta force or something. Another guy in some sort of ROTC training, another cool guy from the hood, and also I would say I probably met half a dozen friendly drug dealers there. And of course a lot of people who believed in conspiracy theories; really friendly, a little weird, but overall good guys. Anyways, one of the biggest benefits of hanging out at that outdoor park, open air, nothing but green grass, the beautiful sun and the fitness equipment was that I think having this sort of open air environment is actually very conducive to socializing, thinking and thought, and pro social behavior. My theory about a lot of modern day antisocial behavior has to do with the structures which enclose us. For example, almost universally most guys at the gym are extremely antisocial. Why? My theory is that because most gyms have closed, cramped narrow ceilings, and do not have access to natural light, or outside space. Cramped indoor spaces promote antisocial behavior. The only good gym I went to which was interesting was the golds gym in Venice, which has this really big outdoor workout area. I think this is much more natural and more fun and better; to be able to work out directly outside outdoors, with your shirt off. Stoics, stoicism — it was originally I think codified by this guy named Zeno, and over time he picked up some followers. Essentially the whole thing happened organically; Zeno would first share his thinking on philosophy ethics and pragmatic ways to deal with other people and the downsides of life, he built a following, and then his followers would propagate the thoughts and start their own little schools of thoughts, their own little stoic clubs. Would I like about stoicism is how loosey goosey it is. It is kind of like zen, or taoism… it is not really quantified as a religion, or a strict moral order. In fact, a lot of the ancients stoics would meditate on random stuff like cosmology, natural sciences like Seneca, how volcanoes worked or whatever. I think nowadays in today’s world, we focus primarily on the pragmatic side; how to deal with fear, uncertainty, downsides etc. ￼I think I might’ve first learned about stoicism from Nassim Taleb and his ANTIFRAGILE book. I was curious, and my curiosity went to deep. To quote NASSIM TALEB and the Venetian saying “The ocean goes deeper, the deeper you wade into it.” I literally consumed every single book I could find on stoicism, even the obscure ones. Funny enough, a lot of the stoic thinkers tried to claim other philosophers as being stoic, like Seneca did with Diogenes the cynic. ￼ Cynic, cynicism, actually comes from the word canine, the dog. Diogenes was considered the “dog” philosopher, first used as a pejorative, but ultimately Diogenes reappropriated that title for fun! He saw dogs as tough, almost like wild wolves, rather than seeing them as a negative thing. Even Achilles when he was raging against king Agamemnon, he called him “dog faced“ as a heaping insult. First, Seneca. Seneca the younger, his dad was called Seneca the elder. In fact, this is such a big deal because Cindy and I named our first son, Seneca, directly after the stoic philosopher. This is true soul in the game; if you name your kid after your favorite philosopher, certainly it is a sign that you really liked that philosopher, or found them impactful. ￼￼￼The reason why I really like Seneca the stoic philosopher is because he had real connections to real reality. What that means is he wasn’t just on the sidelines; he actually existed in the real world, engaged in real politics, was even advisor to the emperor Nero, the bad one, who eventually low-key coerced Seneca to commit suicide, in a manly, dignified manner. I think this was because maybe… there was actually a plan to overthrow Nero, and essentially Nero found out. ￼ I really like Seneca because his writing is accessible, practical and pragmatic, and interesting. A lot of thinkers tend to lack connections to real reality, I have no tolerance for boring philosophers to talk about metaphysics, which is things which are not physical. Like thoughts ideas, the universe, electricity and energy, strange phenomenon and conspiracy theories on ghosts, “energy” whatever. ￼￼For a long time, I would hear the term “metaphysics” being thrown around, and I had zero idea what it actually meant. ￼ Meta– on top of. Or nestled within. Physics — the physical, physical phenomenon like gravity, first principles. The reason why metaphysics philosophers tend to be a bunch of losers is that they are all weak and anemic, nerds or geeks or weaklings who seem to have some sort of physiological degeneracy, which encourages them to opine or talk or think about impractical things, superficial things. Personally speaking, I think philosophy must be practical. ￼￼￼￼ Practical, praxis, ￼practice — to do! I have a very funny ideal; the general idea is that your body looks like a demigod, and your physiology is out of control. The general idea is one must be tall, strong, highly muscular, low body fat percentage, I’m not exactly sure what my body fat percentage is, but maybe it’s around 5%. ￼￼Also, physical fitness is critical to any stoic. My ideal is to walk 50 miles a day, eat 20 pounds of meat like Milo of Croton a day. And also, abstinence from silly things like media, alcohol, drugs, marijuana etc. Trust no thinker who does drugs! Even our best friend Nietzsche said that coffee was bad, because it would make people dark and gloomy. He encouraged 100% cocoa powder instead. ￼￼￼ Simple technique: First, look at a picture or a portrait or a full body shot, ideally topless of the artist, philosopher or thinker or individual… then judge their thoughts later. Why? My theory is this: the thoughts of an individual is hugely affected by their bodily physiology. For example, an extreme example: if somebody is locked inside a solitary confinement cell, and not permitted to go outside for years, but, he had a pen and pad and would jot down some thoughts… Would be the quality of these thoughts? Certainly dark and morose. In today’s world, why does it matter, what is the significance of stoicism, etc.? First and foremost, I think we are living in a troubling time, especially with the advent of modern day internet based media and advertising. I think 99% of what is propagated on the internet is fear mongering, and what is hate? Hate is just fear. The first thought on stoicism is that it is just fear conquering. What I discovered about street photography, is that 99% of it is conquering your fears. Conquering your fears of upsetting other people, getting in some sort of verbal or physical altercation etc. In fact my bread and butter workshop is my conquering your fears and street photography workshop, the workshop which is still interesting to me even after a decade. Why is this so important? I think it is rooted in almost everything; conquering your fears is rooted in entrepreneurship, innovation, risktaking and real life. Even my speculation in crypto. 99.9% of crypto speculation is just balls. Having the balls to make big bets, and when things go south, knowing how to master your emotions. A simple extra I have is this: just imagine it will all go down to zero. It was useful because when I was in college, my sophomore year I got really into trading stocks, and I eventually lost my whole life savings, maybe around $3500 USD, and some bad penny stock which I actually misread the financials… the whole time I thought the company was making a profit, but actually it was taking a loss. I actually didn’t know that if profits are written in parentheses, it means a loss. It was funny because my initial start as an investor was back in high school, I bought some Adobe stock when I was a high school junior, and also some mutual funds, which both went up after about 4-5 years. ￼Also I remember in elementary school computer class, when I was in the sixth grade in Bayside Queens, there was some sort of stock stimulation trading game, and actually it was funny… the kids who made the most money and were the most successful just put 100% of everything into Apple, note this is when we were only 12 years old, and I was born in 1988. ￼Funny enough, it seems that stoicism actually plays well with capitalism. Why? According to modern day capitalist thinking, the best way to approach life is to be objective, strong, stoic, unemotional, logical and rational. Also, ￼with modern day media there is so much fear mongering in the news, about some sort of global armageddon, global financial ruin, etc. I call it “fear porn”. Therefore stoicism as a mindset is useful to think and position your mind in such a way that you could consider that life is all upside, no downside. In fact, if I could summarize stoicism in one sentence, it is that life is all upside, no downside. Inspired by NASSIM TALEB. So, is stoicism useful to you if you’re a man or a woman? Does it matter? The good thing is I think it could apply to both sexes. Conquering sexism and social pressures is useful if you’re woman, and also if you’re a man. Also, gender is social. Lot of the expectations set on us by society is socialized and gamed to a certain degree. First, we got to unchain ourselves from modern day ethics and morality. I believe that all modern day philosophy and thinking and ethics and religion is bad. For example, the notion of turning the other cheek is a patently bad one. Why did Jesus turn his cheek? It is because he lacked on army. Also, philosophically I think we should put no trust in Socrates. ￼￼￼I thought which has puzzled me for a long time was this “Why was Socrates so ugly? Monster in face, monster in soul. I think Socrates was a degenerate, and he lacked any sort of real power. Therefore he turned logic and rationality into his terrorizing weapon (via Nietzsche). Back in the day, you didn’t need logic or rationality to have things your way, you simply was able to dictate that which you wanted to pause it, because you had a military force behind you. Just think about Machiavelli and IL PRINCIPE– the reality of being a mercurial prince, king, and military leader is hard, stoic, “immoral”. But ultimately it all comes down to war, conquest, the military. Trust nobody who uses rationality or logic as their tyrannizing weapon. ￼ In fact, I believe that all should have the body and strength of some sort of super soldier. Essentially look like all the guys from the movie 300, this is our ideal. Demigod physique. ￼ And this is the true courage of Kanye West; he literally put everything on the line, and even lost his spouse and I think maybe his kids? All for the sake of revealing inequities. ￼ “I throw these Maybach keys fucking c’est la ￼vie! I know that we the new slaves.”￼- Ye The fun thing about stoicism is that you could just make it up as you go, devise your own strategies and whatever. “Fucking c’est la vie!” My favorite Kanye West line. Essentially the general idea is that in life, one should not take things too seriously. Laughter is golden, I forget the philosopher who was called the laughing philosopher… Democritus?; better to laugh about the follies of human beings rather than to be dark and morose about it. Also, thoughts from the Odyssey; if you look far enough ￼ into the future, everything becomes comedic and hilarious. So when you’re in some sort of bad situation, just think to yourself “Perhaps one day, 20 or 30 years from now… I will look back at this and just laugh!” It will just be humorous. Honestly, laughter, and kind of being able to joke about things might be the best way to live life and deal with setbacks. ￼ Problems in modern day life: A funny thing I have learned is that when you call something something, it isn’t that. For example, if someone calls something a “luxury car”, it ain’t. For example, a true modern day luxury car is maybe a Tesla, but Tesla never calls itself a luxury car. Also the ultimate luxury technology company is probably Apple… but Apple is very intelligent and not calling themselves a luxury brand. A pro tip is when it comes to websites, read the alternative text, the header text, the stuff that shows up in the tab of your browser window. If the website, the automotive retailer tries to market themselves as a “luxury” brand, typically it is actually a sign that it isn’t a luxury brand it isn’t luxury brand. Thought: what are some good examples of true luxury brands which don’t overly calls itself luxury? ￼￼ In someways, we can think and consider stoicism as our new luxury. In fact, having luxury, luxury of mind and soul… and luxury of freedom of speech, isn’t this the ultimate luxury? When somebody asked Diogenes the cynic; “What is the best human good”? He said “Freedom of speech, speaking your mind, having the power to see whatever is on your mind.” In fact, my current joy is becoming more and more free talking, and free riding. What that means is this; I’m ain’t going to censor myself no more, even if I might be politically incorrect insensitive or whatever. ￼ Also, I would prefer to speak my mind and seriously hurt the feelings of others, rather than soften it for the sake of the other person. ￼￼￼Similarly speaking, when people call themselves “influencers”, they are not influencers. Ultimately I think we should think of stoicism just like having another tool inside our tool kit. For example, if you’re a chef, you’re going to have different knives for different purposes. If you’re going to cut a big piece of meat, you probably want a big ass meat cutting knife, not something you would use to slice an apple with. Similarly speaking, if you’re going to scoop out the insides of an avocado, better to use a spoon rather than using a fork, or a knife. ￼ I think the problem is when some people get too into stoicism (I prefer writing stoicism with a lowercase￼), they think that everything needs to be consistent, and must fit into this nice little neat box of what is considered “stoicism“. This is a bad line of thinking… let us consider that Marcus Aurelius never even mentioned stoicism in his writings, his collections of thoughts, which we moderns call THE MEDITATIONS… it was just essentially his personal diary, to help him conquer his own personal fears and thoughts, I don’t think he ever intended it to be published publicly. I think he just wrote it to himself as self therapy. And I think the only stoic philosopher he even mentions is maybe Epictetus. For myself, I just come out with certain to work out thoughts and techniques because it helps me, and when I find these tricks or techniques or secret hacks or cheat codes… My passion is to simply share it with others. ￼￼￼￼ And ultimately, things are ever in flux and evolving and changing and adapting. For example, I’ve discovered the quality of my thinking is different when I am in Culver City Los Angeles, compared to being in the boring suburbs of Orange County. Also depending on my social environments… my stoic thoughts are different when I am in a gym, vs just working out by myself in my parking spot in the back of my apartment. Also, the quality of my thoughts is different when living with family members or other people versus just living with myself Cindy and Seneca. Assuming you’re not growing your own vegetables and living in the middle of nowhere… you probably have some interaction with other human beings. As long as you have an iPhone, an Android phone, a smartphone, a 4G or 5G internet connection, wifi, a laptop, have to buy groceries somewhere… you’re still going to have to interact with other human beings. And this is good. There is no other greater joy than other human beings. In fact, modern-day society is strange because in someways, the ethos is to be antisocial and to be cowardly. But in fact, the best way to think about things is that real life is interaction with other human beings, and social conquest. One can imagine a lot of modern day entrepreneurship as simply a big dick swinging contest. He who is the most masculine confident tall and strong and stoic shall win. Assume that everyone is mentally insane: Have you ever been out in public, and you see some sort of crackhead or strange homeless person who acts radically, smells terrible, and is obviously mentally ill? Do you hate them for it? When they say something weird to you… do you take it personally? No. Why? They are crazy. Perhaps we should just adopt this stoic mindset towards other people; some people are actually physiologically ill, mentally unwell… don’t trust the opinion of nobody. A lot of people are trying to actually deal with their own inner demons: For example, becoming the successful photographer and street photographer I am today… I’ve dealt with some individuals who would say anonymous bad things about me, and later I found out that their mom just died or something. I cannot imagine what it feels like losing a mother… therefore if somebody spew some hate on me because something bad happened to them, I’m not gonna take it personally. ￼￼￼￼￼Self-flagellation: I think a lot of people who are sick, mentally or physiologically self flagellate themselves. Essentially the way that they deal with other people or themselves is some sort of metaphorical self-flagellation. For example… you know those strange individuals who have the whip and whip themselves, and inflict pain on themselves? I think some people do this metaphorically to themselves and others. You just want to stay away from them. My personal theory on fear is that a lot of it is tied to morality and ethics. I think the general idea is not necessarily that we are afraid of anything… I think the true fear is that we’re afraid that we are some sort of bad evil unethical immoral person. For example in street photography, the general ethical thought is that it is immoral to take a photo of somebody without their permission, because there is some sort of it inherent evil behind it. Is this true? No. Taking photos and not really a big deal. I think it is because some people are just overly sensitive, which once again comes from some sort of physiological weakness. For example, if you’re a weightlifter who could lift 1000 pounds, assuming you’re not taking any steroids or anything… are small things going to bother you? No. But let us assume that you are a skinny fat man, all you do is drink alcohol and smoke marijuana and watch Netflix, and you spent too much time on Reddit… you are 40% body fat, and have never lifted in your life. And also your testosterone is low and you never go outside. Certainly the quality of your thoughts is going to be different than if you’re a happy gay monster, lifting weights outside in the direct sun, laughing and having fun. ￼￼￼ In fact, I’ve actually personally discovered that the reason why a lot of people hate me is because I am so happy jovial and gay. They are secretly suspicious or envious of me? ￼ Probably one of my worst experiences was this jarring transition; I was super happy insanely happy being in Vietnam in 2017; with a beautiful weather, the beautiful light, the happy people the great amenities etc.… and then that winter Cindy and I went to Europe, in Marseille Berlin and Prague, and maybe London… seriously the worst winter of my life. Why? I wonder if so much miserable feelings and thoughts simply comes from the darkness and lack of light. a lot of Europe is actually quite miserable; dark, unhygienic, morose. Even Nietzsche had a thought about Schopenhauer; How much of these emo European philosophers came from the fact that it was just complaining about the cold weather in Germany etc.?￼￼For myself, my ideal weather is Southeast Asia; I love being in Phnom Penh Cambodia, Vietnam etc. In the states, am I the only one who loves living in Los Angeles? Dr. Dre and Kendrick Lamar said that LA was the best for women weed and weather… I would definitely say the biggest upside of living in Los Angeles is the light, the sunlight. It actually does get quite cold here, but usually most reliably even in December during the winter time, the sun will always come up. As long as there is bright sunny light, I will be happy. And I think maybe for myself, considering that I am a photographer, and photography means painting with light… light for me is critical. I also wonder how much of it is a physiological thing and a genetic trait; for example I could even recall being a young child, and my mom telling me that the most critical thing in finding a home or an apartment was light and natural light. Even now… 90% of my happiness comes from being able to ￼have access to natural light, ideally floor to ceiling windows facing directly the sun, having some sort of modern temperature regulated apartment and home. Even living in our tiny studio minimalistic luxury apartment in Providence Rhode Island, where it was always 75° warm and cozy, and not frigid and damp and cold and dark and humid… I was always good. But moving to an older house, where it always felt damp and cold… this literally lowered my happiness by 1000%. Therefore, if you’re feeling miserable sad or whatever… I say spend three months living in Hanoi or Saigon in Vietnam, or go to Phnom Penh Cambodia. I wonder if 90% of peoples misery is simply due to the weather. ￼￼”Better to be a gay monster than a sentimental bore!” – Fernandino Galliani, via Nietzsche My stoic ideal is somebody who is happy, gay, smiling, no headphones or AirPods on, no sunglasses on, no hat, no facial hair, no baggy oversized clothing, no tint in their car. Somebody who makes great eye contact, laughs, stands up upright, jokes, and fools around. Like an overgrown child. ￼Also, lift weights at least once every day, ideally in the direct sun. Just buy some weightlifting equipment on Titan.fitness, I like the farmers carry handles, the Olympic loadable dumbbell, and also the Texas power squat bar. Just buy some cheap weights, and or buy a heavy 400 pound sandbag, and just have fun throwing it around. A true stoic should look something like Hercules or Achilles. Or like ERIC KIM; I have the aesthetic and the physique of Brad Pitt in FIGHT CLUB except with a lot more muscle. Like my friend Soren says, the Adonis physique and proportions. I think a real stoic is sexy, happy and fun. Who doesn’t take life too seriously; and think of everything like a fun game. A real stoic would be joyful and cheery like three-year-old child without any adulteration from the outside world. I don’t like talking with or hanging out with adults, uninteresting. At what point or age do people become so emo? Typically, highschoolers are very optimistic. Even college students. But I think at least in maybe college in high school nowadays… the bad trend is towards “over concern”, about the world the planet ethics animals etc. I find a lot of this thinking superficial, performative, and uncritical. I think “animal rights“, “saving the planet” is this new pseudo world religion; which is just capitalism 3.0. I find the whole pet industry the whole dog industry to be insanely bizarre, and I trust nobody who talks about “saving the planet“ who owns an iPhone, owns any sort of car, or has an Amazon prime subscription. Certainly not any vegans. Animals are animals. They are lower on the hierarchy and totem pole on earth. Man is the apex predator, the apex bully and the apex tyrant. Should we care for animals or “animal rights”? No. Animals are our slaves. If you consider even dogs and pets… they are essentially our emotional slaves. People talk a lot about the virtuosity of dogs being loyal or whatever… and giving you unconditional love. This seems like some sort of emotional slavery. The only dogs I respect are some sort of canine dogs, some sort of attack or defense dogs, or hunting dogs. For example, John Wick 3; Halle Barry and her dogs. An animal should either be a weapon, or nothing. Essentially it looks like men no longer have a backbone. No more spine. I trust nobody who owns a dog. Let us not forget; they call it dog ownership, or “owning a pet”. There is no more concept of “human ownership, or “owning a human.”￼￼￼ What is the end goal of humanity? To me it is towards entrepreneurship, innovation, art and aesthetics, philosophy etc. Design. Stoicism should be considered a tool which could aid you in these things. For example, I think 99% of entrepreneurship is courage. Stoicism could help you with that. I also think with design, great design is also 99% courage, having the courage to attempt something that won’t sell or be received well… stoicism is all about practical courage. The only designers with courage include Steve Jobs, Jony Ive, Elon Musk, Kanye West. ￼ Also, weightlifting. To attempt to lift a certain weight you have never attempted before takes great courage. For example, me atlas lifting 1000 pounds; that is 10 plates and a 25 on each side, ￼￼￼this is true stoic training. Why? The fear of injury is what holds most people back; if you had successfully conquered this fear and not injured yourself, this is pure stoic bliss. I think the only and the only proper way to lift weights is one repetition maximum training. That is; what is the maximum amount of weight you’re able to successfully lift or move, even half an inch? To me, the courage is the success. Even if you had the courage to attempt it… that is what is considered success. ￼￼ Simple exercises to do include the atlas lift, innovated by ERIC KIM, or a one repetition max rack pull. Or, a high trap bar deadlift, heavy Farmer’s walks, or heavy sandbag carries. Or even a simple thing you could do is go to the park or to the local nature center, find the biggest rock there and just see if you could pick it up. If you’re interested in stoicism, and have had some interesting thoughts on stoicism, one of the most noble things you could do is start your own blog. I think blogs are 1000 times more effective than publishing some sort of static printed book; I think the problem in today’s world is that everyone is seeking some sort of legitimacy by being picked up by some sort of legitimate publisher and getting “published“, and seeing your printed book at Barnes & Noble whatever. I say it is better to be open source, free and permissionless, ￼￼￼decentralized. Just publish your thoughts and book as a free PDF, and just host it on dropbox, Google Drive, or your own web server. Share the link freely, and also just publish the raw text as a big blog post. ￼ Even Sam Bankman-Fried wisely thought; 99.9% of books could just be summarized as big blog posts. Don’t trust any modern day published book which isn’t free, because… there is some sort of hidden clout chasing somewhere. ￼ Even one of the worst compromises that led to the demise of Ray Dalio was the fact that he took his Principles book, which was essentially a free ebook PDF on his website, and then took it off, because I think he got a book deal with Simon and Schuster. After he did that, he lost my respect. If you’re already independently wealthy, and you don’t crowd source your self-esteem… why would you need to externally validate yourself by getting some sort of constipated publisher and annoying editor? Editors are bad. Start your own blog and start blogging your own thoughts on stoic philosophy, and even start a YouTube channel and start vlogging on it. ￼￼My generalized thought is simple: if your thought your idea your blog post your video or whatever could even impact the life of one other human being on planet earth… it is worth it.

Title: A millennial couple worth seven figures invests most of their money in 3 ETFs but owns one individual stock and 1.5 bitcoin. Take a look at their portfolio.

Full Content:
After paying off a six-figure mortgage and student loans, Brennan and Erin Schlagbaum shifted their focus from debt paydown to wealth-building. Without a mortgage, the couple was able to save the majority of their income. They put most of their money in low-cost index funds and, over time, their brokerage account surpassed the $1 million mark, according to an account screenshot viewed by Business Insider. BI spoke with Brennan, a CPA who runs the financial literacy company Budgetdog, about his investment strategy and what he held in his portfolio as of December 2024. For years, nearly all of the couple's stock-market money was in three Vanguard index funds: a total stock market fund (VTSAX), a total international stock fund (VTIAX), and an emerging markets index fund (VEMAX). In October 2024, they moved 100% of their index funds to ETFs within all of their accounts in response to Vanguard's rollout of automatic ETF investing. They switched to Vanguard's equivalent ETFs, which you can find on the overview page of the index fund. For example, the equivalent ETF of VTSAX, which Schlagbaum said was their biggest holding, is VTI. The equivalent of their VTIAX holding is VXUS, and the equivalent of their VEMAX holding is VWO. ETFs and index funds are similar — in fact, many ETFs are index funds — and can offer long-term returns, diversification, and cost savings thanks to low expense ratios. One key difference is how they're traded: ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the trading day, while index funds can only be bought and sold once a day at the close of the trading day. ETFs also typically require a lower investment minimum. You can buy a Vanguard ETF for as little as $1, for example, whereas most Vanguard mutual funds have a $3,000 minimum. The Schlagbaums switched to ETFs for two main reasons: One, they're slightly cheaper. For example, VTSAX has an expense ratio of 0.04%, while VTI has one of 0.03%. Two, ETFs may offer tax savings when compared to index funds. ETF investors are taxed only when they sell the investment, while investors who own mutual funds — and index funds qualify as mutual funds — are liable for paying some capital gains taxes when a fund sells assets and realizes a gain. Just because they're putting their money into ETFs doesn't mean their strategy is shifting. They're still playing the long-term, buy-and-hold game, Schlagbaum said, adding that, "if you stay in index funds, it's not going to make or break you long-term." The way he sees it, the ETFs he converted to are very similar in terms of their holdings, just slightly less expensive and more tax-efficient: "It's like, why wouldn't you take it? It's low-hanging fruit, in my opinion." Schlagbaum owns one individual stock: Meta Platforms (META), which he said he bought in October 2022 when the stock price dipped to $97. He prefers index-fund investing to stock picking and especially doesn't like to try to time the market, "but we did time the market a little bit there," he said. "It just seemed like such an obvious buy." He considers META, which is at $624 as of December 16, 2024, "my biggest win of all time." That said, "If you're an investor and you're just starting, individual stocks should not be on your radar. That gets people into so much trouble, and it's not necessary to build wealth. The best investors have the bulk of their portfolio in ETFs and index funds." The couple owns a primary residence, but no investment properties. "If something breaks in my house, I call somebody, even if it's a hanging up a picture," said Schlagbaum. While he has zero interest in managing more than one home, he recognizes the benefit of diversifying his portfolio with real estate, which is why syndication deals make sense for him. A real estate syndication is when investors pool money to purchase a property. Once they contribute capital, their role in the deal becomes completely passive. The real-estate syndicator is responsible for finding the deal, executing the transaction, and, ultimately, delivering returns to the investors. "You lose control from that aspect. You don't really have control over how that performs," said Schlagbaum, who invests in five multi-family syndications. But if you work with a syndicator with a good track record that you trust, "I think it's one of the best ways for somebody that hates real estate but understands the tax benefits of real estate to get in, because you don't have to do anything." A small sliver, 1-5%, of the couple's portfolio is in bitcoin. "We have 1.5, and that position is sitting at $150,000 based on the price right now," said Schlagbaum. "But it's really just 1.5 bitcoin in general. That's going to move with whatever the pricing is, but that's been a huge grower. We were buying at around 15,000, and now it's at 100 plus thousand." When it comes to highly speculative assets, he believes in having a number of things in order before investing: "Bills paid, emergency fund intact, bad debt paid off, retirement secured, non-retirement invested, all other financial goals are handled — and then, if you have extra money, I think bitcoin is a solid buy."

Title: Wishes, love, and reshuffling (afterwards): The Arrival of Pavlos and the… royal matters, the forgotten bank amendment, Viva’s battle in London
URL: https://en.protothema.gr/2024/12/18/wishes-love-and-reshuffling-afterwards-the-arrival-of-pavlos-and-the-royal-matters-the-forgotten-bank-amendment-vivas-battle-in-london/
Time Published: 2024-12-18T09:33:06Z
Full Content:
Hello! So, a few days ago, I wrote to you about the Christmas spirit making its timely appearance (right on cue as we approach the holidays…). It has been felt in political life, suddenly in the media (let’s see how long that lasts), and, as of yesterday, among the MPs of New Democracy. The meeting of K.M. (Kyriakos Mitsotakis) with them went very well—smiles, selfies, and casual chit-chat about this and that (a little Lebanon, a little Syria, a little Recovery Fund)—and we’re all one big happy family, waiting for:a) The selection of a President of the Republic (that we all need to vote for), andb) The subsequent cabinet reshuffle, in which it’s hoped that around 7-10 MPs will be promoted to deputy ministers, and maybe even ministers, replacing some of the non-parliamentary ministers currently holding office but not contributing much. And the Reshuffle?So, now you might ask, what kind of reshuffle is this going to be? Well, the answer is that I could list everything I’ve heard, you could read it, and then recycle it over festive dinner conversations—but that doesn’t mean Mitsotakis will necessarily follow through with it. Honestly, I think the thread of the reshuffle starts with Gerapetritis and whether K.M. will bring him back to the Maximos Mansion (the Prime Minister’s office) or not. One source tells me that Gerapetritis himself is very keen on returning to his old position, which of course matters. If that happens, there’s one scenario in which Hatzidakis moves to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Pierrakakis to the Ministry of Economy, and Christos Dimas to Education, etc., etc. But let me tell you, I personally wouldn’t hold my breath for such predictions. Columns like this are meant to feature such entertaining reports—or “reports”—that often turn out to be baseless chatter and are far from official government gazettes. The Arrival of PavlosA major stir was caused by yesterday’s revelation that Pavlos (the eldest son of the former King of Greece) has decided to apply for Greek citizenship—a development that constitutes… a great victory for Democracy, considering that he will finally acquire a last name. I’d argue that this is a collective national fixation we’ve failed to resolve for 50 years—unlike every other civilized Western country. As of yesterday, the firstborn son of the former King is in Athens, and it’s not unlikely that he’ll head to the Athens Registry Office with Nikolaos, as it seems acquiring citizenship is a family decision. What Pavlos hasn’t shared with his interlocutors, however, is which surname he has chosen, as this is a prerequisite for identification along with recognition of the Constitution, the form of government, and the 1974 Referendum decision. The entire family will have to file similar applications, and any grandchildren born after citizenship is acquired will automatically inherit it. Pavlos’s Last NameA reliable source tells me that the surname Pavlos has chosen for his family is “Di Grecia,” as it appears on the Danish passports held by members of the former royal family. Of course, when asked about this, Pavlos offers “no comment,” avoiding delving into the issue while not denying the information either. The Banks and the FalloutThe greatest loss for the banks from the recent measures isn’t financial—though it’s not negligible—it’s the communication storm they faced from the political leadership and the press. This has tarnished the industry’s image in a way that cannot be immediately repaired. To be fair, the €100 million for the property entity, as well as the €100 million for schools, had already been put on the table by the banks. Another issue they raised was related to the procedures for the “My Home” program. Specifically, on July 5, 2023, the banks proposed to the government that the engineering certificate requirement be waived for applicants seeking to purchase apartments under the “My Home” program. They even submitted two alternative amendment drafts for this waiver, which would apply only to program beneficiaries. The proposal was made because the banks had identified that “My Home” required contract signings to be completed within 6 to 8 months of eligibility approval—a timeframe often insufficient for property legalizations due to bureaucracy. The Battle for Viva Continues in LondonThe legal battle between WeRealize (WRL), owned by Haris Karonis and Makis Antypas, and JP Morgan over Viva continues unabated. The two shareholders of the Greek fintech filed an appeal against the London High Court’s June ruling on the fair valuation of the company. According to the legal-focused Law360, both sides took issue with aspects of the initial decision. The appeal hearings began on Monday in London, where JP Morgan’s legal team (Freshfields law firm) argued that Viva’s valuation should not include a future U.S. expansion plan. Meanwhile, WRL’s lawyers (from Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan) claimed that JP Morgan has blocked Viva’s U.S. entry and hindered updates to its business plan, which would significantly boost the fintech’s valuation. The dispute centers on Viva’s valuation and which financial figures independent appraisers should use to determine its fair value in a potential sale, as well as the weight of the current business plan. It was revealed in court that any changes to Viva’s business plan require the consent of both shareholders. WRL argued that JP Morgan vetoed any modifications to the plan. The clash essentially revolves around the terms of the call option as part of JP Morgan’s acquisition of 48.5% of Viva, announced in 2022, which valued the fintech at €1.7 billion. According to disclosed terms, WRL forfeits its right to reject any Viva acquisition by JP Morgan if Viva’s valuation falls below €5 billion by the end of the fourth call option period in July 2025. The hearings continue. Signatures for the VOAK before the end of Q1 2025 Demanding procedures and a tight timeline are in place for the implementation of the major concession project Chania-Heraklion, which will become the most complex closed highway constructed in Greece in the coming years. The Northern Road Axis of Crete (VOAK) took center stage recently, as it was the focus of discussions during meetings between the Prime Minister and the political leadership of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport in Crete. According to the latest plans, the contractual documents for the Chania-Heraklion section are nearing completion and are expected to be finalized by the end of January. At this stage, the provisional contractor, GEK TERNA, is submitting the necessary information to secure its designation as the final bidder. The relevant documents have already been sent to the European Commission for Competition to provide an opinion on the project, and it is estimated that the contract will not be signed before the end of Q1 2025. Industry insiders describe VOAK as a highly challenging project due to the lack of studies and the need for a new route design to address construction difficulties and local opposition. This complexity is one of the reasons why construction companies (GEK TERNA, AKTOR, and METKA) have reached an agreement on managing the project and dividing their shares in both construction and the concession. This agreement is expected to be formalized after the contract signing, meaning after April 2025. It should be noted that both GEK TERNA, which is currently the provisional bidder, and METKA have been part of the project concession from the beginning of the tender, which is expected to exceed €2 billion. AKTOR entered the game later, following its acquisition by the administration of A. Exarchou. Public Proposal Today marks the final deadline set by law for mandatory public offers. Consequently, the informational memorandum by Masdar for TERNA ENERGY is expected to be submitted to the Hellenic Capital Market Commission. Interest from… India… for co-production at HDS At Hellenic Defense Systems (HDS), beyond the matter of the consortium with the Czech group CSG (for which a decision by the Council of State on the injunctive measures is expected any day now), there is considerable activity. Recently, major business groups from… India have expressed interest in producing ammunition at HDS that could be sold in the Middle East, Europe, and Africa. This interest was demonstrated both during a visit by Indian entrepreneurs to Athens 20 days ago and in a meeting between prominent Indian businessmen and the Prime Minister at the Greek ambassador’s residence in London in early December. Moreover, HDS is currently receiving interest in other projects as well, such as the maintenance of Patriot missiles and participation in the IRIS-T missile program, which will expand with new orders worth an additional €50 million. ADMIE and Google The recent, sudden announcement by ADMIE that it has reached an agreement with Serverfarm, a leading data center management company, to create the Gemini joint venture aimed at developing and operating hyperscale-ready data centers in Greece (up to 130MW), now has its explanation. It seems that ADMIE has secured its first major “hyperscale-ready” client for this data center, rumored in the market to be Google. Having already completed 15 years of presence in Greece, Google is ramping up its investments in the country, particularly in the Cloud and Artificial Intelligence sectors. The demand from the private sector for such services is increasing, while the government has also agreed to integrate AI into public services and sectors such as Civil Protection and Health. Meanwhile, ADMIE’s stock is soaring to unprecedented levels, with a market capitalization of €585 million and a price of €2.5, representing an 18.6% increase compared to six months ago. EYDAP is Planning (and Staying Quiet About It) Not a single word escaped the lips of EYDAP’s management yesterday regarding the highly anticipated—and nearly obligatory—placement of shares into institutional portfolios. This move is aimed at ensuring the necessary dispersion of ownership as well as boosting liquidity ahead of the company’s very large and ambitious investment plans. EYDAP’s top priority is to ensure that Athens does not run out of water, which is why it is rushing to finalize the details of connecting the Kremasta Lake with the reservoirs of Evinos and Mornos. Completing this project will require at least two years. Desalination, while considered an expensive (three times the cost) and often ineffective process by EYDAP’s management, could still be used in areas like Thisvi, Aspraspitia, or Itea, where infrastructure and industrial facilities already exist. For the water supply needs of the Hellinikon project, EYDAP plans to follow the successful model used on Aegina. Major parks, such as “Tritsis” and “Hellinikon,” will be irrigated using recycled water, which, however, requires a specialized network. Awaiting the Three Witches of Friday and… Santa Claus Just seven trading sessions remain until the end of this year’s stock market season, and the General Index is just over 3% away from reaching the psychological target of 1,500 points, spurred by the traditional “Santa Claus rally.” On the flip side, without genuine buying interest, most market moves are aimed at “locking in” profits and polishing up the valuations of professional portfolios. Banks continue to offer no support to the General Index, and yesterday other heavyweight stocks faced selling pressure as investors liquidated to increase their cash reserves ahead of the new year. This Friday marks the expiration of derivative contracts across stocks, indices, and commodities, which is why everyone is talking about December’s “triple witching.” Additionally, the FTSE index rebalancing will be finalized, with Autohellas departing after celebrating its transition with a +1.74% gain yesterday. The General Index closed at 1,452.8 points yesterday, losing -0.8%, with a trading volume of €122.14 million, of which just €7.2 million came from block trades. Banks are not seeing strong buying interest, but neither are they facing aggressive sell-offs. OTE, PPC, OPAP, and Jumbo saw losses exceeding 2% yesterday, driven by investment strategies. TITAN (+1.41%) at €39.45 was the only stock managing to offset the weight on the General Index, albeit modestly. How Likely is a Global Debt Crisis Today? Most economists today estimate that the probability of a serious global debt crisis over the next three years does not exceed 30%. Is this figure reassuring? Perhaps. The fact remains that, since we avoided a major debt crisis over the past two years—when public debt skyrocketed (in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic) and central banks dramatically raised interest rates to combat hyperinflation—the likelihood of a global debt crisis is now receding as things calm down. However, there are causes for concern. China, with total public and private debt at 290% of GDP (and half of its population on the brink of poverty), poses a significant risk. Still, China’s debt is almost entirely domestic, denominated in yuan. With inflation under control, its central bank could leverage its balance sheet to buy bonds and stave off a debt crisis if necessary. In the U.S., the fiscal deficit has reached $1.8 trillion in 2024 (6.4% of GDP), with official interest expenses exceeding $1 trillion annually. The spark for a global public debt wildfire could ignite in one of the emerging economies prone to fiscal mismanagement. Finally, serious problems may lurk in the “less transparent” corners of global debt and derivatives markets. There, we can only hope that the lesson of Lehman Brothers has been learned. From France to Germany: Disappointment Continues Germany is far from forming a functional government, and this is already reflected in its business confidence indices. The well-known Ifo Business Index dropped to 84.7 in December, down from 85.6 in November. This is the lowest level for the Ifo since May 2020, significantly below the long-term average of 96.6, with disappointment visible even when compared to recent years. Since the start of the war in Ukraine, the index has averaged just 88.2. The plunge in the Ifo Index is attributed to a sharp drop in expectations, which fell from 87 in November to 84.4 in December. The Lonely Party of the “Magnificent Seven” The Magnificent Seven was a classic 1960s Western directed by John Sturges, depicting the gritty journey of seven gunfighters in the Wild West. In today’s glamorous world of Wall Street, the term “Magnificent Seven” has been repurposed by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett to describe the seven tech giants: Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla—which, while not just an automaker, is now regarded as a high-tech company. These seven stocks are currently worth over $18 trillion. They have recorded gains of around 50% since the beginning of the year, compared to the 20% gains of the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 and the index’s overall +28% increase. This is happening while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has recorded its ninth consecutive losing session as of late last night, marking the longest downward streak since 1978.

Title: Oracles of Wall Street 2024

These 11 economists, strategists, and analysts made prescient calls that defined financial markets in 2024 In many ways, market trends in 2024 seemed like a continuation of those in 2023. The US economy remained on its path to a soft landing. Artificial intelligence companies retained their dominance and repeatedly beat earnings. And it increasingly looks like the S&P 500 is due to post another year of 20%+ returns. But that doesn't mean there weren't new developments in various corners of the market, or that these trends were particularly easy to predict. That's where Business Insider's 2024 Oracles of Wall Street list comes in, highlighting strategists, analysts, and economists who were on the money with their calls this year. Selections were made based on internal and external nominations, and those whose calls were both accurate and against consensus at the time were given the most weight. The list, of course, is not exhaustive, but it aims to lift some of the most impressive calls recently for some of the biggest trends in markets this year. Below, we break down how each selectee made their calls and share their top forecasts for 2025. The S&P 500 has continued on its torrid pace in 2024, posting 27% gains so far in 2024. Investors have cheered on rate cuts, artificial intelligence investment, economic stability, and Trump's election victory, lifting the index beyond most expectations. As the index sits just below 6,100, some strategists were closer than most with their predictions. Last December, the median 2024 year-end price target among top Wall Street strategists was just 4,500, according to Bloomberg data. In December 2023, DeGraaf said the S&P 500 could hit 5,800 in the year ahead based on a few pieces of evidence he saw. His proprietary cycle clock indicator, which considers inflation and growth trends, was bullish based on the premise that inflation was expected to stay cool while growth would be moderate enough to induce monetary stimulus. On top of that, investor sentiment was below where it should have been for how the market was performing in 2023, he thought. "Sentiment was ridiculously bearish for the kind of year we were having," DeGraaf said. "That's usually bullish. We call it the skeptical advance." His also-proprietary "thrust" indicator, which considers market momentum gauges, showed a 22% return over the following 12 months as the average outcome given momentum conditions at the time. "We just said, 'Look, this combination of things taking place certainly look bullish," he said. Next year, DeGraaf sees the S&P 500 delivering returns closer to 15%, a bit lower than the 28% gains so far in 2024. "We still like what we see," he said. Back in March, Bartels also predicted that the S&P 500 would rise to 5,800 by the end of the year. Bartels has been bullish since the stock market bottomed out in late 2022. Even when the market saw minor pullbacks in 2024, she pointed to strong corporate earnings and the continued leadership of the technology sector as tailwinds propelling stocks higher. With the index now north of 6,000, that optimism has proven correct. In particular, Bartels strongly believes that AI can transform the economy to the same extent as previous innovations, such as the personal computer. Similar to the early days of the tech boom in the late 1990s, Bartels believes many strategists don't know how to fully price in the impact of AI. "I think people are underestimating the improvement in productivity from AI," Bartels told Business Insider. "Productivity will continue to improve just like we saw from 1995 to 2000." Bartels is confident that the S&P 500 will continue to smash expectations in 2025. She's predicting the index ends next year at 7,200 to 7,400, and she doesn't expect the bull run to fizzle out beyond next year, either — Bartels believes that the S&P 500 could go as high as 10,000 by the end of the decade thanks to pro-business legislation, lower interest rates, and AI. Richey was another strategist who saw the S&P 500 climbing well above consensus. Building on Sevens Report founder Tom Essaye's bullish fundamental outlook, Richey compiled the technical indicators he watches and concluded in February that the index could hit 6,000 by the end of 2024. For example, the S&P 500's relative strength index, which measures price momentum, had stayed in "overbought" territory for three weeks at the time. When that has happened in the past, it's meant that the trend could continue for several months, Richey said. Investor sentiment was also bullish but not over-extended. And the yield curve was still inverted despite no sign of recession. "Some of the biggest gains in the bull market — statistically, it's measurable that they occur during yield curve inversions such as the late '90s and 2006-2007," he said. Going into 2025, however, Richey sees signs that the rally could face hurdles if a negative catalyst comes along. "Looking ahead, the collection of market indicators and cyclical signals we monitor suggest all the pieces are in place for this bull market to end in the weeks or months ahead and for a cyclical bear market to begin," Richey said in an email. But he added that: "There is nothing in the current fundamental backdrop that suggests a bear market in stocks is a sure thing or even likely for that matter." As we start to approach the midpoint of the 2020s, it's becoming increasingly clear that the US economy is in another "Roaring '20s" era a century after the first. Fiscal and monetary stimulus have fueled an extremely robust economic recovery following the pandemic, and artificial intelligence is expected boost profit margins and productivity. One strategist first called this a few years ago, and stuck with it even as recession fears swirled: In late 2021, Draho said in a client note titled "Rose Colored Glasses" that the US economy would enjoy a strong decade ahead. And even as recession fears became consensus in the market in 2022, he stuck with his call, arguing that government spending, artificial intelligence investment, and other factors would boost economic growth and create another "Roaring '20s" era. Three years later, Draho's prediction is well on its way to coming true. The economy has survived a bout of inflation and subsequent Federal Reserve rate hikes, multiple spending packages have been signed into law, and AI has disrupted the market landscape in full force. In 2025, Draho thinks GDP growth will remain higher than 2%, and the S&P 500 will climb to 6,600. "The way things have been trending, it's quite possible that by early 2025 only the most pessimistic investors will need rose-colored glasses to see a clear path to a Roaring '20s outcome," Draho wrote in a September 30 note. The first 50 basis-point cut in 16 years was one of the year's big surprises. Even after the call temporarily became consensus in August, the move at the September FOMC meeting still came unexpectedly to most. But at least a couple of economists stuck to their guns. Many in the market pushed back on Feroli's prediction that the Fed would start off its easing cycle with a 50 basis point cut in September. Other experts argued that such a cut would send the markets into panic by signaling that the economy was in a bad place. However, Feroli, who previously served as an economist at the Fed, believed that a more significant reduction in interest rates would be necessary to strengthen the labor market — and that the Fed would prioritize economic policy over the optics of a 50 basis point cut. Feroli thought the Fed should have started cutting in July, so a larger rate cut in September was one way to help the Fed catch up on its quest to bring interest rates into less restrictive territory. Going forward, Feroli believes 2025 could very well be an uneventful year for both growth and inflation. Trump's reelection means that there's already a playbook for investors of how things went down the first time, he said. However, a change in the White House is still bound to introduce some unknowns to the economy, especially regarding potentially inflationary policy proposals like tariffs and tax cuts, which is why Feroli believes the Fed will cut at a less aggressive pace next year. Feroli doesn't see any more jumbo-sized cuts in the future, and expects a 25 basis point cut in December. Dutta was another economist that stayed with his 50 basis point cut call for the September Fed meeting. He first argued that the Fed would cut by 50 basis points in August, when the Sahm Rule unemployment recession indicator triggered. That quickly became the consensus, but that view quickly faded in favor of a 25 basis point cut after August's inflation data showed continued cooling in price growth. Dutta, however, kept with his call. "The case for 50 is strong, so we are sticking with it," he wrote in a September 15 note. "Powell is more cautious than his counterparts. The most memorable line from his August 23 Jackson Hole speech was, 'We do not seek or welcome further cooling in labor market conditions.' Since then, labor market data has surprised uniformly to the downside." For 2025, Dutta said his highest-conviction view is that investors are overestimating the amount of fiscal stimulus that Congress will approve. "I think the most you can really expect is an extension of the tax law," he said. "Because it's a very thin majority in the House, it's going to be very, very challenging to ram things through." While investors expected rate cuts in 2024, most thought they would come much sooner than they did. A couple of experts, however, argued late last year that the market wasn't appreciating the degree to which the Fed was going to have to put off slashing their benchmark rate as the economy continually proved resilient. This time last year, the market was pricing in a near-0% chance that interest rates would still be above 5% in July 2024, with the expectation that the Fed would begin cutting rates as soon as March 2024. At the time, the federal funds rate was 5.25%-5.5%. But Osmani didn't agree with the overwhelming consensus. Instead, he said in November 2023 that the Fed wouldn't start cutting rates until the second half of 2024. Osmani based his call on the view that central banks would fail to reach their inflation targets. Specifically, wage inflation would continue to be an issue as consumers sought pay raises to keep up with rising prices, further fuelling stickier-than-expected inflation. When July came around, the fed funds rate had remained unchanged from the start of the year, proving Osmani's outlook correct. Looking towards 2025, Osmani believes that inflationary pressures will increase thanks to the impact of tariffs on top of already elevated wage inflation levels. As a result, expect the Fed to behave like a "hawkish dove," he said, meaning that while the Fed won't reverse course on rate cuts, it'll slow the pace of easing. Colmar was also in this camp, defying overwhelming market consensus that the Fed was poised to slash rates early in the year. He argued in January this year that the economy didn't need rate cuts, and that the Fed signaling them would essentially lead to a scenario where financial conditions eased on bullish sentiment, making inflation stickier, further hindering their leeway to cut. Realizing this, the Fed would then need to push rate cuts out as it sought to justify them, he said. Colmar said the Fed would end up cutting by 50-75 basis points in 2024. The central bank has cut by 75 basis points so far, and is expected to drop them again in December, but the market at the time was pricing in more than an 85% chance that rates would be even lower by the end of 2024. Plus, rate cuts have come far later than the market originally expected. "Our view was that interest rates weren't restrictive. Powell had just said that it was very restrictive, and we need to cut rates to bring it back down to equilibrium not to put us into recession. The market seemed to buy into that, and we said, 'No, no, no, he's got it wrong.'" In 2025, Colmar said he sees inflation hovering around 3%, above the Fed's 2% target. After lagging the S&P 500 for the first half of the year, small-cap stocks kicked off a furious rally in July as investors saw rate cuts on the horizon. Small-caps' sudden jump in anticipation of lower borrowing rates and an economic acceleration was one of the biggest moves in the market in 2024. Jonathan Golub saw it coming. The UBS strategist published a client note titled "Small Caps to Outperform Over Near Term" on June 18, and the sector surged just weeks later, with the Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund ETF (VB) rising 8.5% from July 9-July 15, and 17% in the second half of the year. "Over the past year, Small Cap stocks have outperformed when Treasury yields have declined, and underperformed as they've risen. When this relationship has become disconnected, it has quickly reverted," Golub wrote in June. "Since May 30, Large Caps have outperformed by 6.2% despite falling interest rates, a much larger disconnect than the one experienced earlier in the year. This represents the potential for mid- to high-single-digit Small Cap outperformance over the near term." Heading into 2025, Golub argues in a recent client note that currently high stock valuations are justified. He has overweight ratings on the financials, Industrials, technology, and utilities sectors. Nvidia had an incredible year in 2023, and its share price only flew higher in 2024, rising 180% thanks to impressive earnings beats amid strong demand for its graphics processing unit products. In December of last year, Nvidia was Ramsay's top chip stock pick for 2024. The stock had already appreciated 220% to a price of around $500, and Ramsay was confident that it had another 40% upside, giving it a price target of $700. One year later, Nvidia has broken record after record and Ramsay has repeatedly raised his target. After Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split in June, Ramsay set the chip giant's price target to $140, up from $120, by year-end. Nvidia's flagship GPU product is used by every leading cloud service provider and AI company — including Google, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla, and OpenAI — to train their large language models. "The suite of superior technology, long pedigree of innovation, and extensive growth-oriented investments should allow for strong, sustained, above-peer growth across a widening set of verticals," Ramsay wrote in a June 9 client note. While Nvidia GPUs are most well known for their use in data centers, Ramsay also mentioned a promising up-and-coming business line: autonomous driving, which became a billion-dollar component of Nvidia's business at the end of fiscal year 2024. Other growing end markets for Nvidia chips include gaming, healthcare, and robotics. Nvidia has smashed analyst estimates every quarter this year, most recently posting $35 billion in revenues last month for fiscal year 2025 Q3. TD Cowen has now upped Nvidia's price target to $175 for the next 12 months, citing sustained customer demand for the company's new Blackwell chips, released in March of this year. Ramsay recently left TD Cowen, the firm said. The price of gold also went on a tear this year, beating the S&P 500 so far thanks partly to rate cuts and global central banks buying up the asset. In July of this year, Milling-Stanley saw a plethora of signs pointing to a rally in the price of gold. At the time, gold was trading at around $2,370 per ounce. Milling-Stanley set a target price of $2,700 by the end of the year, representing 14% further upside. Gold has historically performed well in times of economic uncertainty, and there was plenty of uncertainty in the markets this year. Impending rate cuts, US dollar depreciation, sticky inflation, and geopolitical conflicts all signaled an increased appetite for the yellow metal, as investors sought to put a bigger portion of their portfolio in what has historically been deemed a safe-haven asset. Additionally, central banks in emerging markets began upping their allocation to gold, leading to a spike in buying behavior. The price of gold hit an all-time high ahead of the election on October 30, closing at $2,788 an ounce. It's up 30% overall this year for a price of $2,721 per ounce, in line with Milling-Stanley's prediction. With the potential of several inflationary policies being implemented under Trump, Milling-Stanley doesn't see demand for gold going anywhere in the year ahead. Tariffs, tax cuts, and increased government spending are all inflationary policies that will heat up the economy and increase prices, he said. The increasing national debt will be another factor supporting the price of gold as the dollar weakens, Milling-Stanley said. He predicts an 80% probability for the price of gold to stay at current levels or go higher — potentially as high as $3,100 an ounce by the end of next year. Jump to

We recently published a list of 10 Important AI Announcements for Investors. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) stands against other important AI announcements for investors. Blue Whale Growth, the investment fund supported by billionaire Peter Hargreaves, has reduced its holdings in major US tech firms, mentioning concerns over their substantial AI-related spending. Financial Times reported that fund manager Stephen Yiu highlighted a significant reduction in Microsoft shares, which dropped out of the fund’s top ten holdings for the first time since 2017. He noted that the return on invested capital for the company might decline due to AI investments and hinted at potentially exiting the stock entirely if AI costs exceed cash generation. The “Magnificent Seven” tech giants have faced growing scrutiny over their rising capital expenditures on AI infrastructure, with Wall Street increasingly wary about returns. Yiu has also reduced stakes in Meta and previously exited Amazon and Alphabet, expressing concerns over AI-driven spending outpacing profitability, the report states. While the fund remains optimistic about Nvidia, which now represents around 10% of its portfolio, Yiu expressed less confidence in the other six companies. He also supports Broadcom, benefiting from AI infrastructure development. According to the report, Blue Whale Growth, managing £1.3 billion, has returned 24% this year, outperforming peer funds, but has reduced its exposure to US tech stocks significantly compared to benchmarks.

In stark contrast to the caution seen in Western markets, Southeast Asia’s emerging economies are racing to establish themselves as key players in the global AI landscape. According to CNBC, the region benefits from a youthful, digitally savvy population and growing government support for AI initiatives. While Singapore has already made significant strides in AI adoption, other countries, such as Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaysia, are also accelerating efforts to harness AI for a range of industries, from agriculture to manufacturing. This growing focus on AI offers immense potential for economic growth, creating new jobs and boosting productivity. However, as these countries ramp up their AI strategies, they face challenges related to infrastructure, digital literacy, and the need for skilled workers. As experts point out, the AI race in Southeast Asia is not just about adoption but about tailoring technology to the region’s unique needs. Despite the hurdles, the region is positioning itself as a promising center for AI innovation, and many expect that ASEAN’s commitment to AI could help its economies thrive in the global tech ecosystem. Meanwhile, SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son is making a bold move to accelerate AI development globally. Son plans to invest $100 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, with a significant focus on artificial intelligence and related infrastructure. His goal is to create 100,000 AI-related jobs before the end of President-elect Donald Trump’s term, as reported by Reuters. Known for his strong advocacy for AI, Son has already made notable investments in AI companies such as OpenAI and Graphcore, further signaling his commitment to the sector’s growth. This massive investment, paired with Southeast Asia’s rising AI ambitions, highlights the growing global momentum behind artificial intelligence. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz upped his price target for Datadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) to $170, up from $155, while keeping an Outperform rating on the stock as part of his outlook for the software sector in 2025. This adjustment reflects the broader trend of increasing valuations for several companies, driven by higher comparison multiples. Moskowitz noted: “DDOG remains a clear leader in the observability market, with multiple businesses at scale, and with potential tailwinds in the form of digital transformation, cloud migration, and GenAI.” The firm expressed a more optimistic view than many regarding cloud adoption in the coming years, mentioning both existing on-premise customers and new clients as key drivers. This was part of its detailed 2025 software sector outlook. Overall, DDOG ranks 6th on our list of important AI announcements for investors. While we acknowledge the potential of DDOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Following significant workforce reductions in 2022 and 2023, this year has more than 130,000 job cuts across 457 companies, according to independent layoffs tracker Layoffs.fyi. Companies like Tesla, Amazon, Google, TikTok, Snap and Microsoft have conducted sizable layoffs in the first months of 2024. Smaller-sized startups have also seen a fair amount of cuts, and in some cases, have shut down operations altogether. By tracking these layoffs, we’re able to understand the impact on innovation across companies large and small. We’re also able to see the potential impact of businesses embracing AI and automation for jobs that had previously been considered safe. It also serves as a reminder of the human impact of layoffs and what could be at stake in regards to increased innovation. Below you’ll find a comprehensive list of all the known layoffs in tech that have occurred in 2024, to be updated regularly. If you have a tip on a layoff, contact us here.

The pending layoffs come after hundreds more employees were laid off in 2023. Confirmed to TechCunch that layoffs, conducted in December, had impacted 14 employees, accounting for 60% to 70% of the company, according to multiple sources.

Title: CFOs Are Paid More, But Have Less Job Security

Plus: Signet Jewelers CFO Talks About Her Strategy To Boost Top Line Growth, Rate Cut Is Likely This Week, SoftBank Makes Huge U.S. Investment Pledge, A Tax Deductible Executive Security Plan The CFO’s role is becoming more important to the company overall. In recent years, CFOs have played a more active role in creating strategy for the company overall, not just tallying up the funds but devising new programs, structures and tech investment plans to help the company’s bottom line. A new study from Datarails finds that average CFOs are becoming better compensated for their work. The average CFO salary, from an analysis of SEC filings for 1,657 publicly traded U.S. companies, was $3.8 million in 2023, up 9% from 2022 and one of the highest in the C-suite. CEOs and CTOs are the only positions that make more, with the average CTO salary only slightly more at $3.9 million. But the CFO also has the worst job security in the C-suite. In the last five years, the average CFO was at a company for only 3.1 of them. Datarails found that 48% of the companies it included in the study—771—had at least one CFO turnover in the last five years. Twenty-two had four CFOs in five years, while 152 had three. Breaking it down by industry, the average utility company CFO is there just over two and a half years. “The CFO position has become less a destination and more a crucible,” the report says. “Success can launch careers to new heights.” And that is true for some: The report found 15 CFOs who were promoted to CEO at their company in 2023. And, the report says, this underscores the new power of the CFO’s position. While it can have tenuous security, it’s a real opportunity for leaders to be forged, proving their acumen in both finance and strategy, and eventually rising to the top. Joan Hilson, chief finance and operating officer of Signet Jewelers, knows all about building strategy to drive better operations and sales. After coming to the world’s largest diamond retail company in 2019 as part of a strategic overhaul, she reformulated the financial and operational arm of the company to operate better in today’s consumer reality. I talked to her about these moves, and an excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. Forbes CFO will be taking time off for the holiday season. This is our last newsletter of 2024. We’ll be back in your inbox on Tuesday, January 7. Happy holidays! The Eccles Building in Washington, D.C., where the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee are headquartered. In the run-up to the last Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting of the year, which begins today, indicators have been mixed. Inflation remains sticky, with last month’s consumer prices 2.7% above where they were in November 2023, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics last month. Core inflation—excluding food and energy costs—was 3.3% higher than a year ago. The CPI met analysts’ expectations, though it’s a tenth of a percentage point higher than October’s 2.6% inflation rate—but both are above the 2% Federal Reserve target. These figures show a high likelihood that the Fed will cut its target interest rate for the third straight time since September. According to CME FedWatch, 97% of economists predict a quarter percentage point cut, down to 4.25%. While the rate cut trend has continued, Forbes senior contributor Simon Moore writes that in 2025, the trend may slow down, especially if inflation doesn’t start coming down more. Inflation is only one piece of the puzzle—job growth and the overall economy are also taken into account—but persistent inflation held interest rates at the two-decade high of 5.25% for more than a year. The stock market had a big week as well, with the Nasdaq composite exceeding 20,000 for the first time ever on Wednesday. The inflation report, as well as big tech stocks and AI confidence, buoyed the market rally, and the index again exceeded 20,000 on Tuesday morning. But all companies did not have a good week. Chipmaker Nvidia found itself in correction territory Monday, posting a more than 1.6% loss—11% below its all-time closing high of $149 on November 7. While nothing new happened with Nvidia on Monday, the continued dip may be residual hesitancy based on Chinese authorities announcing last week an antitrust investigation into Nvidia for issues stemming from its 2020 acquisition of Israel’s Mellanox Technologies, writes Forbes senior contributor Dan Runkevicius. SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son delivers remarks alongside President-elect Donald Trump and his choice for Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort. Japan’s SoftBank announced a huge investment in the U.S. on Monday. At a joint event with President-elect Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son announced the tech funder would invest $100 billion in the United States over the next four years, doubling the $50 billion investment SoftBank made during Trump’s first term. Son said the investment will bring about 100,000 jobs in AI and related industries to the U.S. “President Trump is a double down president, I’m going to have to double down,” Son said at the joint press conference. However, Forbes’ Richard Nieva notes there could be an issue with that commitment: SoftBank doesn’t have $100 billion right now. Its market cap is close—$97 billion as of Monday, Nieva writes—and the commitment is for investments over four years, meaning there is time for SoftBank’s funds to grow. SoftBank’s commitment comes on the heels of many Big Tech executives kowtowing to the president-elect—and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman all announcing $1 million donations to Trump’s inaugural fund. Police place bullet casing markers outside the hotel in New York City after United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson was fatally shot December 4. Since the shooting death earlier this month of United HealthCare CEO Brian Thompson as he walked into the annual Investor Day meeting in New York City, C-suites and boardrooms have been buzzing about executive security. While some companies have taken immediate measures like removing executive pictures and profiles from their websites, others are beginning to look at actual security details to protect the executives—something that just over a quarter currently have. But executive security is a costly proposition. Last year, Apple spent $820,300 on personal security for CEO Tim Cook, as well as $1.6 million on his private aircraft travel, writes Forbes’ Kelly Phillips Erb. However, she writes, there are ways for companies to get tax breaks on executive security. According to tax law, essential security measures for an executive—those provided in response to “bona fide business-oriented security concerns” that are provided as part of a plan pursuant to independent security studies—can be deducted by the company. (The SEC considers executive security to be reportable compensation, so they are disclosed.) Signet Jewelers Chief Financial and Operating Officer Joan Hilson. The fine jewelry industry has seen big changes recently, and Joan Hilson has been there to lead the way. Since 2019, she’s been CFO of Signet Jewelers, the world’s largest diamond jewelry retailer that is the parent company of Kay Jewelers, Jared, Zales, Blue Nile and Banter by Piercing Pagoda. She was recently promoted to chief financial and operating officer. I spoke to Hilson about how Signet Jewelers’ new strategies, both before and since the Covid-19 pandemic, have helped the company cut costs and increase sales. This conversation has been edited for length, continuity and clarity. A longer version is available here. When you first came to Signet in 2019, you focused on restructuring the finance department. Why was this important, and how did you do it? Hilson: I joined Signet in 2019, as we were working to transform the overall company. The transformation was cultural, strategic and, at its core, financial. My job was to link arms with our [then-]CEO Gina Drosos and the senior leadership team to be one of the key drivers and an architect of our future growth plans. When I came in as CFO, Gina started to disassemble some of the top-down culture that needed to change. I was excited to dig into the financial side, the forecasting, and bring goals and an understanding of those goals to the team so that they can realize what we needed to achieve to drive a strong framework for our future. We rolled out [strategic plan] “Path to Brilliance” in 2018, and because of the progress we made on those goals, we accelerat[ed] to the “Inspiring Brilliance” strategy, which focused on enhanced capabilities. One of the things that I focused on as the financial leader of the company was: What do we need to do to drive top line growth and recognize that our banners span 80% of U.S. jewelry customers. By focusing on our core banners, we can drive that top line growth, which was critical to our strategies. We also focused on expanding our operating margins. That came along with developing a high-margin jewelry services business, which can take care of all of our customer needs, in terms of love and care for their jewelry. Along with that, we focused on a cost-savings initiative that drove out costs over $900 million since 2019. We did that by not just focusing on cutting costs that the customer doesn’t see or care about, but by changing processes and understanding how to simplify and what’s important to the overall growth of our business. Those efficiencies included the labor scheduling model we have in our stores. We have over 2,500 stores. With investments in data and analytics, we were able to bring forward labor scheduling models that enabled the strongest jewelry consultants to be in the stores at peak hours. We were able to look at locations by hour and by jewelry consultant to understand the best productivity opportunities. Our sales per labor hour is a key metric. [It] was up more than 40% versus pre-pandemic. It was a huge improvement in leveraging analytics and labor scheduling to serve our customers ultimately in a better way. The next big focus was our real estate strategy. Over my tenure, we closed over 1,000 stores. We did reopen stores in optimal locations for our business, but the net was a 630 [store] closure. It improved our gross margin leverage by 400 basis points by optimizing our fleet and then putting stores in the right locations within markets. We also moved from in-mall to off-mall to better serve some of the smaller markets in the U.S. While doing that, the savings that we were able to achieve we invest[ed] in our digital capabilities. With this change, we were able to grow our e-commerce business significantly over the five years from 2019. We went from 5% penetration to 20% penetration. We brought Signet into the digital and technology world and proved that jewelry and high-price-point items can be purchased online. In general, consumer spending across many categories has been down for about the last year and a half. How has Signet made it through that? We have a value-oriented consumer and they are looking for a value in whatever they purchase. We brought an assortment that can speak to the different economic circumstances of our customers. We have a portfolio that spans from Banter by Piercing Pagoda to Diamonds Direct and Blue Nile at the accessible luxury end of our business. Within each of those banners, we have good, better, best price points based on overall design and content of precious metals. We’ve addressed it with assortment architecture and bringing our customers price points that serve wherever they are at that time of year or their circumstance.

Title: My favourite VR headset from 2024 just got its first major price cut, and it's not the one you think

Just in time for Christmas - and you get three free games When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Meta Quest 3S and Apple Vision Pro sure have hogged the VR limelight this year, but there's another headset that I think you should know about if you're shopping for a new mixed-reality device this Christmas. The Pico 4 Ultra launched only a few months ago, and it has some specs that are even more powerful than the Meta Quest 3. I was scrolling through Christmas-time deals at Amazon today when I came across its first-ever major discount - to the tune of a £60 reduction. That means that for a limited time, you can get the Pico 4 Ultra for just £469 at Amazon, which is the same price as the 512GB Quest 3. Because this VR headset is so new, the discount isn't all you get. You can still make the most of the Pico 4 Ultra's launch bundle, which gets you three free games (try saying that a few times out loud) with your purchase for no extra cost. Those games are packing serious heat: Blade & Sorcery, Pistol Whip, and Synth Riders, as well as a one-month subscription to VRChat Plus. That's quite tempting versus the one free Batman game you get when buying the Quest 3. Pico 4 Ultra 256GB + 3 Free Games + VRC+ Subscription | £529 £469 at AmazonSave £60 - This is the first time that the Pico 4 Ultra has dropped in price since its launch earlier in the year. Its pre-order bonus offer is still available, which means you can get three free games with your purchase, two of which are Blade & Sorcery and Pistol Whip, which are two of the best VR games ever made in my opinion. Buy it if ✅ You want a powerful standalone VR headset✅ You want something that's better than the Meta Quest 3✅ You want to play on PC✅ You want three free games to get you started Don't buy it if: ❌ You'd prefer a Meta Quest headset❌ You already own a PS5 Now priced at the same level as the Meta Quest 3, the Pico 4 Ultra finds itself in a straight shootout. I've had the good fortune of reviewing both headsets and although both are plenty capable of giving you mixed reality goodness and VR gaming fun, there's one I'd probably choose over the other. Pico 4 Ultra has 12GB of RAM, more than the 8GB you get in the Meta Quest 3. In addition, it has a really lightweight feel on your head because the head strap you get out of the box is a bit more substantial than the stock one Meta gives you. This spreads the weight a bit better, meaning it's more comfortable to wear for longer sessions. One of my biggest concerns with Pico's OS was that it might have a smaller library of games than the popular Quest options. While that is true, I was surprised that the 4 Ultra still had access to lots of great titles, and many of the best VR games are present. In standalone mode, the Pico 4 Ultra uses the same processor as the Quest 3, the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2, but with its beefier memory, larger battery, faster Wi-Fi, and crystal clear frontal cameras, I'd probably pick the Pico 4 Ultra. You may think the opposite is true when you consider the Quest 3's increased 512GB storage or slightly wider field of view, but I'd disagree. Memory makes more of a difference to gaming performance in a VR headset, and a longer battery life will be a big factor for you. VR games are bizarely small in terms of storage sizes, and in over a year of owning my Quest 3, I've not come close to filling up its 512GB drive. Of course, if you're on a budget, you might want to opt for the cheapest alternative, which will be the Meta Quest 3S. It also shares the same chipset as the headsets above, although does cut some corners with other internal specs. Still, it only costs £299, so if you need to keep costs down at this time of year (I wouldn't blame you), that headset might suit you better.

Title: AppLovin has rocketed to a $100 billion valuation. Some industry insiders are skeptical its run can last.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/applovin-meteoric-rise-some-advertisers-have-big-questions-2024-12
Time Published: 2024-12-17T15:43:04Z
Full Content:
Shares in the mobile ads and gaming company AppLovin have been running wild — and advertising industry insiders have a lot of questions. AppLovin entered the Nasdaq 100 in November, with its market value surpassing the $100 billion milestone and shares up more than 780% so far this year. It's a remarkable ascent for any company, but especially for one that had flown fairly under the radar until recently, even within the ad industry itself. At its current valuation, AppLovin dwarfs even The Trade Desk, long considered adtech's star performer, which has a market capitalization of around $65 billion. AppLovin — which helps app developers make money through advertising and find new users through ads — has grown its share to 42% of the mobile gaming market, per analysts at Piper Sandler. But there's one key new development that's driving its stunning stock run: e-commerce. Bullish analysts say AppLovin has room to grow further and do for e-commerce marketers what it has for gaming companies, taking on Meta in the process. "In all my years, it's the best product I've ever seen released by us, fastest growing, but it's still in pilot," AppLovin CEO Adam Foroughi said of the company's new e-commerce product on an earnings call last month. With its stock riding high, some industry insiders also think AppLovin could make a transformative acquisition that would make it a household name. Still, others in the ad industry say AppLovin's business model deserves some skepticism amid its meteoric rise. 22V Research analyst John Roque wrote in a recent note that AppLovin was the most overbought stock in the Russell 3000. AppLovin declined to comment on a list of detailed questions about its business. Wall Street's interest in AppLovin soared this year as the company unveiled a plan to go after a new target customer outside the mobile gaming community: e-commerce advertisers. The move opened up a total addressable ad revenue opportunity of around $120 billion, two to three times the size of the $40 to $50 billion mobile games user acquisition market, according to Macquarie Equity senior analyst Tim Nollen. Nollen recently raised the firm's target share price for AppLovin to $450 from $270, citing its e-commerce push. Cody Pfloker, chief marketing and revenue officer for Jones Road Beauty, which is testing AppLovin, said direct-to-consumer advertisers are excited by the prospect of a new player in the market. "Meta has been the dominant customer acquisition channel for brands and while other platforms have come up like TikTok a few years ago, none are either as efficient or scalable," Pfloker said. "Nothing has been able to dethrone Meta." AppLovin says it can reach a potential audience of 1.4 billion daily active users across mobile apps and connected-TV devices — an audience comparable to Meta or Google's apps. Pfloker said part of the appeal is that e-commerce advertisers can easily repurpose their Meta ads into ads for AppLovin's mobile games and other apps. AppLovin is only inviting e-commerce advertisers that spend upward of $20,000 a day on Meta ads to try its product, and it's incentivizing some of those buyers with $10,000 ad credits, multiple industry insiders told BI. They, like some others in this story, requested anonymity to preserve business relationships; their identities are known to BI. Prescient AI, a marketing measurement company, ran an analysis in October that found AppLovin delivered a 1.5 times higher return on ad spend for its customers than Meta and Google Adwords, on average. "A pretty startling thing is happening," said Will Holtz, VP of strategy and operations at Prescient AI. The top spenders are spending 25% to 30% of their budgets on AppLovin, he said, something Prescient hasn't seen before on a new channel, except for something like TV where people bulk up spending over the holidays. What's more, Holtz added: "They're spending incremental dollars; they're not just shifting budget away from channels like Meta." It's worth noting that the ads are full-screen and can't be skipped, which also likely boosts some performance metrics compared to other platforms. The results are also early and could fluctuate as more advertisers come on board. Despite the enthusiasm from some customers, others in the digital ad community have raised concerns about AppLovin. Some industry insiders attribute AppLovin's performance to its cornering of every part of the mobile app ad transaction. AppLovin operates AppDiscovery, the technology that advertisers use to buy the ads; the MAX mediation technology developers use to sell their ads; and the ALX exchange that connects the two. It also has Adjust, its ad measurement platform, and AXON, an AI engine designed to improve the performance of its ads. This could give AppLovin a unique view of the market and allow it to see what different advertisers and buying platforms are bidding. Theoretically, AppLovin could use this intelligence to refine its own ad bidding strategies. "It's one company for monetizing your app, growing your userbase, and then grading its own homework," a mobile ad veteran told BI. "They say there's a firewall and 'we don't talk,' but it's hard to prove otherwise." If that sounds familiar, it's because it's similar to how people often describe the approach that helped Google dominate advertising on the web. A judge in Google's adtech antitrust trial is currently weighing whether that strategy, as well as its use of other auction tactics, amounted to Google operating an illegal monopoly. Google denies this and has said the adtech market is fiercely competitive and that its innovations have brought benefits to consumers, publishers, and advertisers. Jeromy Sonne, the founder of marketing AI technology company Simbiant, has been monitoring the early AppLovin e-commerce results. He said he'd seen an "extremely high correlation" between when AppLovin sees a spike in conversions and when Meta sees an increase in ad spend. He said he hadn't seen a similar trend when comparing Meta and Google or AppLovin and Google. He said that made him wonder if AppLovin was driving real incremental value or whether its campaigns were just reaching the exact same audience as Meta in some way. He said he'd also seen a "concerning overlap" where Shopify sales purportedly driven by AppLovin have a very high geographic overlap with where Meta ad website traffic was coming from. Separately, Prescient AI's analysis found that brands spending between 25% to 30% of their digital ad budgets on AppLovin acquired fewer incremental new customers than brands in the 5% to 10% range. While reacquiring some old customers isn't necessarily a bad thing, the finding raises questions about the appropriate level of spending advertisers should devote to AppLovin, Prescient AI's Holtz said. Other advertisers have questioned why AppLovin doesn't share granular data about exactly where their ads ran. "It's a little bit of a black box — we have no idea where our ads are appearing," Pfloker said of AppLovin. "There's a lot to be excited about, but there's a lot to be skeptical about." AppLovin recently paid more than $150 million to add developer Zynga's portfolio of games to its MAX ad exchange as part of Zynga's divestment of its adtech platform Chartboost, three people familiar with the matter told BI. This boosted AppLovin's already huge audience of gamers. A spokesperson for Zynga owner Take-Two declined to comment. Some in the industry think AppLovin could make an even bigger move. The company recently sold $3.5 billion in bonds, which Bloomberg reported were to pay down debt "and for general corporate purposes." Could that include an acquisition? Alex Merutka, an early AppLovin employee who now runs his own digital marketing company, Craftsman+, thinks AppLovin should make a bid for a social network — a particularly valuable sector of apps because users tend to be logged in, visit often, and share useful data. People who use mobile games don't usually hand over data like phone numbers or email addresses, vital pieces of information for marketers to help connect their ads to outcomes, and to retarget users with ads. AppLovin is already trading at a larger market capitalization than Snap, Pinterest, and Reddit combined. Years ago, Snap held informal, early-stage talks about potentially acquiring AppLovin, a person familiar with the matter told BI. Perhaps the roles could be reversed this time around. While Snap posted a revenue growth bounceback in its latest quarter, it's struggled to keep momentum amid fierce competition from the likes of TikTok. AppLovin could theoretically help optimize Snap's ad platform for performance advertisers to better compete with Google and Meta. "If Adam was in control, Snap could be a $100 billion business — a $200 billion, $300 billion company — and AppLovin would be stronger too," Merutka said, referring to AppLovin CEO Adam Foroughi. "There's a lot of opportunity there." However, AppLovin execs said onstage at the Nasdaq Investor Conference earlier this month that M&A wasn't a near-term priority and that the company was keeping a close eye on its head count and margins. "It's much harder than people realize, and it's exceptionally hard for a company that's structured like us," Foroughi said of M&A and the difficulty of absorbing different company cultures, according to a transcript provided by the market intelligence platform AlphaSense.

Title: What's Happening With Broadcom Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/12/17/whats-happening-with-broadcom-stock/
Time Published: 2024-12-17T14:07:18Z
Full Content:
SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA - DECEMBER 12: A sign is posted in front of a Broadcom office on December 12, ... [+] 2024 in San Jose, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO), a semiconductor, enterprise software, and security solutions provider, has seen its stock surge over 40% in a week. This can be attributed to better than expected earnings and outlook, followed by stock upgrades from some of the large Wall Street institutions. Also see, Buy, Sell, Or Hold Bitcoin? Broadcom recently reported its Q4 fiscal 2024 results (fiscal ends in October), with revenues of $14.05 billion and earnings of $1.42 per share, versus the consensus estimates of $14.09 billion and $1.38, respectively. Broadcom is seeing a stellar demand for its AI products, a trend expected to continue in the coming years. Let’s dive deeper into the company’s recent performance and the impact on its stock price. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Broadcom’s revenue of 14.05 billion in Q4 was up a stellar 51% y-o-y. This can partly be attributed to the contribution from VMware, which it acquired for $69 billion last year. Apart from VMware, Broadcom’s AI products contributed to its top-line growth. The company’s AI revenue in fiscal 2024 stood at $12.2 billion, reflecting a whopping 220% y-o-y growth, driven by strong demand for its AI XPUs (Broadcom’s custom AI accelerators) and Ethernet products. Broadcom is benefiting from the generative AI boom, with its wide suite of networking and storage solutions, cybersecurity, and semiconductor offerings. Broadcom also announced that it’s developing AI chips with three large cloud companies, which reportedly include Google and Meta. The company’s outlook of $14.6 billion in Q1 fiscal 2025 also reflects a strong 22% y-o-y growth. Not only did the company post strong revenues in Q4, its adjusted operating margin expanded 90 bps y-o-y to 62.7%. Higher revenues and margin expansion resulted in the bottom line of $1.42 on an adjusted basis, versus $1.11 in the prior-year quarter. Also, look at What's Behind The 500% Rise In RGTI Stock? Admirably, AVGO stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last 4 years. Returns for the stock were 56% in 2021, -13% in 2022, 104% in 2023, and 104% so far this year. Similarly, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Broadcom’s solid growth for its AI products and guidance prompted an upward revision for its stock price by several Wall Street analysts. That said, most of the estimates are now met, after a large 40% move seen in a week. At its current levels of $250, AVGO stock now trades at 23x trailing revenues, versus the stock’s average P/S ratio of 5x over the last three years. Now, the company’s acquisition of VMware, the massive opportunity in generative AI with its chips, as well as networking products, and strong profitability does warrant a meaningful upward revision in valuation multiple. After its recent rally, AVGO has now become the eighth stock to exceed the $1 trillion market capitalization. Notably, the $226 average of analysts price estimate for AVGO stock implies that it’s now fully valued. While AVGO stock looks like it is fully valued, it is helpful to see how Broadcom’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

Title: Meta Quest 3S review: “Maybe the best entry-level VR device ever created”

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The Meta Quest 3S isn’t like other Lite hardware, because it actually feels like the flagship Quest 3 and you really need to look to see the differences. This will give most players everything in a VR headset they’ll want, and it’s not going to break the bank like this technology usually does. In short, it continues the mission of the Meta Quest 2 by bringing great standalone gaming, mixed reality, and a huge wealth of games and apps to the masses at a reasonable price point. Approachable price tag Huge library of games A lot of spec similarities with the Quest 3 and… …It actually feels like an affordable Quest 3 Controller tracking isn’t great Battery life is fine Fresnel lenses do feel like a downgrade No audio jack Why you can trust GamesRadar+ Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy. I’m going to level with you and admit that, even for someone like me who has tried a number of different VR headsets through the years, it can be hard to tell the difference between the Meta Quest 3S and its full-fat sibling. Yes, there are a few obvious comparisons you can make, but for their respective prices, the Quest 3S does a very impressive imitation. And that’s a good thing. A lot of the time an “S” device that comes in cheaper than a flagship model feels half-baked because the manufacturer really wants you to spend money on the more expensive version. The Quest 3 is one of the best VR headsets out there at the moment, but it didn’t exactly continue the Quest 2’s mission of making virtual reality technology affordable for all. The Meta Quest 3S remedies that because it comes in two sizes (128GB and 256GB) and costs only $299.99 / £289.99 or $399.99 / £379. That lower MSRP is the same price as the Quest 2 before it was discontinued. Pandemic launch or not, that headset made a name for itself by making a mainstream VR device approachable, and the Quest 3S may see major success for the same reason. Not only does the Meta Quest 3S feel like the proper spiritual successor to the Quest 2, but it sort of looks like one too. It has the same rectangular look with sharper corners that make it look a bit more refined. If it weren’t for an upgraded frontal camera module, the Quest 3S would look eerily similar to the Meta Quest 2. For a “Lite” model of the Meta Quest 3, it does make me laugh that Zuck’s engineers have only managed to shave one measly gram off the Quest 3’s weight. It’s the equivalent of taking a feather out of your inventory in Skyrim and suddenly not being over-encumbered, and it’s hilarious that Meta is actually marketing it for its “lightweight design”. Nice try. The Quest 3S comes with the same cleverly designed head strap as the Quest 3. It’s definitely a basic, stock option, but it does the job with a top velcro strap that can be adjusted to your head size, as well as some loops around the back to tighten or loosen the fit. Thankfully, the design of the Quest 3S has been thoughtfully executed, since the best Meta Quest accessories made for the original will fit either headset - no need to buy specially fitted ones for either device. Out of the box, the facial interfaces of both feel identical, with some fabric upholstery and quite plush cushioning for your cheeks and forehead. It’s no surprise that the Quest 3S connects to a charger or gaming PC through USB-C, although it misses out on the Quest 3’s 3.5mm audio jack, which is a shame. I’m not sure this would cost too much more to add in 2024, and since budget buyers are far more likely to use it than wireless or Bluetooth headsets, it feels like a glaring omission. Thankfully, you get the additional onboard buttons for when your controllers inevitably run out of battery. Some volume adjustment keys and a handy action button lie on the headset’s underside, which should always be present on standalone headsets like this. There’s also the standard power button on the 3S’s left-hand side. Even when you’re looking at the spec sheets comparing the Quest 3 and 3S, you need a trained eye to figure out the differences, because, in truth, there aren’t many. Both feature the same Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor, which is one of the biggest wins of this more affordable headset. It’d be all too easy for Meta to scale back on power for the lighter model, but with so much competition in the VR world at the moment, the use of this processor feels like they’re rolling up their sleeves. The Pico 4 Ultra also launched this year, touting that same APU but even more RAM than the Quest 3. Despite Meta’s financial footwork to get around it when the Quest 3S launched, the Pico 4 Ultra is still a serious rival in Europe, so this processor is more important than a lot of shoppers realize. If you think about it, the Quest 3S gets you the processing power of the Quest 3, the Pico 4 Ultra, and even the new HTC Vive Focus Vision for undeniably cheaper than any of those devices. The latter will set you back $999 / £999, and although it’s designed to harness the power of the best graphics cards, that’s still a massive win for people buying the Quest 3S. The biggest talking point for most is that the Quest 3’s pancake lenses are missing from the Quest 3S. For me, this is perhaps the most noticeable change when using either headset. The wider area of focus really does make a difference in gaming and mixed-reality menu hopping. Combine that with a lower per-eye resolution, and the Quest 3S does start to feel more like a budget option. Still, with the same 8GB of RAM, integrated spatial audio speakers, and variable refresh rate, the Quest 3S has more than enough to make first-time VR buyers swoon. Another spec disparity of note is that the Quest 3 has an integrated depth sensor which can help with passthrough clarity as well as room tracking and mapping. The Quest 3S omits this, instead using a few InfaRed projectors to map out a room and your position in it. I didn’t notice less accurate tracking in my side-by-side tests of the 3 and 3S, but it might be worth taking into consideration if you play in a more sensitive area of your home with lots of breakable goodies near you. Similarly, if you play in darker rooms, the Quest 3’s depth sensor might be better for low-lighting conditions. Battery life is technically better on the Quest 3S, despite its mAh being smaller. Depending on what you use either headset for in one session, you’ll get a similar 2-hour battery life without a pro headstrap. I’ve found just over 2 hours for either is an accurate statement, with gaming being the more intensive activity that brings it down closer to that baseline. Neither is particularly impressive in terms of lifespan because they’re just short enough to feel like an inconvenience. If you don’t charge up between uses, you’re probably going to be cutting your next Power Wash Sim session short. What is constantly disappointing is that the controllers have an even worse battery life, and will often run out of charge between uses. For that reason, I can highly recommend charging docks to keep the controllers ready to go for your next session - unless you have an unlimited budget for AA batteries. I want to state right now that the Quest 3S is a very impressive VR gaming device for the money. Most of the performance notes I have are about the few times I paid attention to the man behind the curtain, noticing where the Quest 3 does things better. That’s probably going to be the case for most “Lite” model reviews because it’s where the natural comparisons are going to sit. That said, it doesn’t mean the Quest 3S isn’t worth buying. I’m really looking for the nitty gritty details I’ll mention below, and I’ll admit that they were quite tricky to find. Normally, I wouldn’t actually compare two devices so closely when they have a two-hundred-dollar price disparity, but the fact I feel those comparisons are valid says a lot of good things about the Quest 3S on its own. Even five years ago, the idea of an “entry-level” VR headset was pretty alien. The idea of a headset under $450 with full-color passthrough, genuine standalone gaming power, and loads of mixed-reality potential was so out of reach that it was a fantasy. For the first few weeks of testing this headset, I wasn’t actually sure what I was going to say in this review. Unless I really looked for the slight differences between the 3 and 3S, I couldn’t find them. I could boot up a game and play for hours without any immersion-breaking performance hiccups to give away that I was using a “budget” device. Especially if you’re not used to playing VR games, this headset will be very capable of making your jaw drop. Like the Quest 2 before it, it can immerse you to a degree that you’ll come out of a longer session and need to take a second look at your real hands to know you’re out of the Matrix. The resolution per eye may be weaker than the Quest 3 512GB, but when it’s that close to your eyeballs you don’t need to suspend your disbelief like you might need to on a big TV these days. In truth, it took me diving into the same levels in both headsets to really understand the weak points of the 3S. The Quest 3’s colors and display seem more vivid and colorful overall. Maybe this was the pancake lenses showing their worth, or the fact that two LCD displays are better than one. Perhaps it was a combination of these things and the Quest 3’s boosted resolution. Regardless, things just seem more focused, and colors appear clearer on Quest 3. The Quest 3S still does a great job though, making it easy to spot the tiny bits of grime that still needed washing away in Power Wash Sim. I must say, both headsets come up a bit short in Blade & Sorcery Nomad when it comes to jaggy lines - something the Pico 4 Ultra has them both beat on. Doing more formalized tests really solidifies the value of extra RAM in that headset, especially because environments and details in surroundings pop in much more noticeably on the Quest 3S. Controller tracking is also a bit disappointing, which makes some weapons in the game unusable. The Pico 4 Ultra suffered similar issues, but I felt much more immersed in my sequences of fantasy mass murder on Pico’s headset than I do on the Quest 3S. The increased resolution of the Quest 3 really shows its worth in Asgard’s Wrath 2, with even its softer, more illustrative art style appearing clearer on the flagship model. To a layman, these environments will still be plenty expressive on the 3S, but you definitely notice a difference with some beefed-up resolution and an extra display panel. The same great audio quality from the Quest 3 carries over to the 3S though, so I can’t make any complaints about how immersive and high-quality games sound. I’m not one for mixed-reality spatial computing, but I did a bit more testing with this headset than I usually do. I can see it being a big draw for people who like the look of the Apple Vision Pro but are attracted to a much more affordable device. Hand tracking works fairly well for the most part, allowing me to pinch my fingers to interact, or get physically closer to a virtual menu and use them like I would a touch screen. The fact that Meta's Quest OS windows now operate within real spaces is pretty clever. Going upstairs in a friend’s house, then looking down at the ground, only to see the headset’s app library window still open through the floor was a bit wild, and something people are bound to get a kick out of. Watching content on YouTube and streaming services was where I found the Quest 3 to be a much more versatile option because focus is such a priority for big virtual cinema-like screens. With Pancake lenses, you definitely get a wider area of a virtual cinema screen in clarity without needing to move your head. Similarly, the Quest 3S’s narrower FOV makes itself known in these instances where you aren’t fully immersed since it can be harder to zone out the black borders around your content. Either way, PSVR 2 and the detail and vivid colors its OLED displays can throw at your eyeballs is much better. Not least because the inky black surroundings of any virtual screen in cinematic mode help you to feel more immersed. Keep in mind that I’m making these comparisons from the point of someone who has tried lots of VR headsets and that I’ve really been looking for holes to pick in the 3S. Even five years ago, the idea of an “entry-level” VR headset was pretty alien. The idea of a headset under $450 with full-color passthrough, genuine standalone gaming power, and loads of mixed-reality potential was so out of reach that it was a fantasy. The Quest 3S has all of that, and the fact I can nitpick those features in a device at this price point is excellent. If you haven’t yet owned a modern, standalone VR headset, this is a fantastic option that gets you so many of the Quest 3’s software tricks and lots of its internals for a decent price. Enthusiasts who have played a lot of VR games before, on either a Quest 2 or PC VR headset, will probably want more than the 3S can provide, so I’d be inclined to recommend the full-fat Quest 3, or the Pico 4 Ultra. If you do have more budget to play with, maybe consider a PC option like the HTV Vive Focus Vision - not least because my concerns with how Meta collects our data still make me hesitant to recommend its hardware (see my Meta Quest Pro review). Still, this is maybe the best entry-level VR device ever created. Both in looks and spirit, it’s the spitting image of its father, the Meta Quest 2. However, with updated internals and software perks to its name, it’s potentially more worth a buy than its parent ever was. I tested the Meta Quest 3S for just over a month before writing this review. In that time I’ve used it for plenty of VR gaming, as well as watching some streaming content and general spatial computing tasks. I played a lot of Blade & Sorcery Nomad, Power Wash Sim VR, and Asgard’s Wrath 2 on the Quest 3S to test its gaming potential. To compare it with the Quest 3, I loaded up the same levels in each game and played them one after the other to take notes.

2024 Marked by Strategic Repositioning to Spatial Core AI and Cloud Based Revenues, Significant DoD Contracts, and Positioning Toward Revenue Growth and Profitability NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / December 17, 2024 / The Glimpse Group, Inc. ("Glimpse") (NASDAQ:VRAR)(FSE:9DR), a diversified Immersive Technology platform company providing enterprise-focused Virtual Reality ("VR"), Augmented Reality ("AR") and Spatial Computing software and services, today issued a letter to shareholders from its President & CEO, Lyron Bentovim, summarizing key Glimpse developments for Calendar Year 2024. Dear Shareholders: 2024 was a transformational year for Glimpse, in which we made significant strides in our strategic transition to focus on providing enterprise-scale Spatial Computing, Cloud and AI driven Immersive middleware software and solutions ("Spatial Core") - led by our subsidiary company Brightline Interactive. This successful transition included major contracts with leading U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD") and other large entities, while working directly with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cesium and many others. In parallel, we streamlined our organizational structure and reached a point where we are cash flow profitable from operations. We achieved this milestone without raising capital and while maintaining a clean balance sheet with no debt, converts or preferreds. In fact, we expect our cash balance on December 31, 2024 to match and potentially exceed our cash balance on September 30, 2024 - the first time that has occurred in our history as a public company from internal operations only. The Immersive industry itself also made important progress in 2024, with major initiatives and products announced by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Nvidia, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Samsung (KS:005930), Snap and others. These bode well for the Immersive industry in general and for Glimpse in particular. Spatial Core Summary: In 2023 we commenced on a strategic transition, focusing our investment on Spatial Core. This transition was largely completed during 2024 and Spatial Core is now Glimpse's primary growth engine and value driver. Spatial Core has tremendous potential and has gained strong traction during the year. We are working with some of the leading companies in the world to develop the Immersive middleware that takes in huge amounts of 2D data, creates detailed and life-like digital twins in 3D and then on top of that 3D data makes complex computations inside the digital twin environment while also adding important utility functions, all via the Cloud, in large scale and in real time.Spatial Core is highly relevant and powerful in industries where there is complex 2D data that can be utilized far more effectively in a 3D setting with multiple use cases in Enterprises, Manufacturing, Engineering/Architecture, Oil/Gas, Robotics as well as in Government and the Military.AI is a key element in Spatial Core:Automate the generation of digital twin environments - 2D to 3D, utilizing machine learning and computer vision.Generative AI inside a Spatial Environment - utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to ask functional questions about a descriptive environment. For example, "If I place a building in this location, will I be able to see the other building".Neuro Learning Networks - learn in an immersive environment by performing a function repeatedly, based on visual inputs, and then distribute that learning to all other participants. For example, robots learning to do complex tasks.These AI capabilities, combined with the vast and real time computing available via the Cloud, and delivered via 5G networks are transformative in our ability to create complex and powerful simulations and scenarios, in a cost effective, scalable and effective manner.I encourage you to view the Spatial Core webinar we hosted earlier this year: "The intersection of AI and Spatial Computing, bringing the power of bringing AI into the 3D world": https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2934/51186 Examples of Spatial Core traction include:Signed a $4MM+, 12-month contract with a Department of Defense entity for a Spatial Computing ecosystem, integrating AI workflows and accelerated compute for a variety of defense use-cases.Entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the US Army Combat Capabilities Development Command, Command, Control, Communication, Computers, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Center, to develop, assess and improve workflows to create and augment synthetic imagery for use in training and assessing AI and machine learning Machine learning algorithms.Extended partnership with a Fortune 500 government Systems Integrator for VR Training in Digital Twin Environments to a key U.S. government agency with over 45,000 employees on a mid six figure contract.Brightline Interactive, Cesium & NVIDIA teamed up at the GEOspatial INTelligence Symposium 2024 to introduce Brightline's Spatial Core which uses AI workflows for complex computations on top of real life data sets, enabling powerful real time, massive data driven, digital twin and simulation applications.Successfully Completed the Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the US Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division for the adaptation of immersive technologies.Completed a contract to support a major immersive technology hardware provider to accelerate their computing interfaces into GPU-enabled cloud, with streaming and visualization capabilities.We are at an advanced stage of securing several additional multi-million dollar Spatial Core contracts with multiple Government, DoD and large enterprise customers. The short-term aggregate value for these contracts is in the $5-10 million range.Each of these potential contracts has significant growth elements built into them that could lead to significant annual recurring software revenue once the original contracts have been successfully performed.Other Glimpse Entities Summary: In parallel to Spatial Core, our other Immersive businesses continued their positive momentum. Some examples:Foretell Reality entered into a 6-figure partnership with a large University to develop an AI-driven VR training system enabling students and trainees to learn various professional skills through conversation-centric simulations with an AI-based avatar in different immersive settings.Glimpse Learning entered into a two year, mid-six figure contract with the College of Staten Island CUNY ("CSI") Technology Incubator for the design, deployment and integration of a suite of immersive technologies in its new Innovation Hub. This is a cross Glimpse effort, with a significant software license componentIn recent months, we have experienced an increase in our revenues with Snap for AR 3D models and lenses.Sector 5 Digital ("S5D") entered into a 6-figure engagement with one of the world's largest architecture firms to visualize in AR the new business campus of a multinational retail company; a mid-six figure contract with a global water and hygiene infrastructure company for an augmented reality (AR) solution; and a mid-six figure contract with a global energy company for Immersive content.Glimpse Learning entered into a multi year, mid-six figure contract with a state district for Immersive education.Immersive Industry: While the Immersive industry, and Glimpse as a significant participant in it, has faced challenging headwinds over the past two years, we are now seeing and experiencing concrete positive growth indicators in both our business and the Immersive industry. We believe that the Immersive industry is poised for significant growth, driven by:Meta's VR gaming platform continues to grow, and their new Ray-Ban AI glasses have exceeded expectations, demonstrating consumer appetite for discreet wearable tech.Apple boldly entered the headset market with the Vision Pro, its initial Spatial headset, signaling their intent to lead the next digital era.Samsung's recent re-entry to the market, leveraging Google's new Immersive operating system, signals a competitive resurgence and further industry maturation.Perhaps the most significant development lies in Meta's "Orion" concept AR headset. This vision of seamlessly integrating digital experiences into the real world represents a fundamental shift in human-computer interaction. This vision is directly correlated with our vison for Spatial Core.Specifically, as it relates to Spatial Core, the following are key industry developments:Matured AR Cloud and Interoperable Standards for Enterprise and Government Workflows: standardized "AR Cloud"- open standards and protocols enable seamless interoperability, allowing different contractors, departments, and partners to integrate and share geospatial data, maintenance records, and situational guidance without being locked into proprietary ecosystems.Enhanced On-Device Spatial AI for Operational Efficiency and Security: Spatial computing devices can now perform advanced AI-driven tasks directly on their own hardware, enabling real-time environmental understanding, object recognition, and anomaly detection without constant cloud connectivity. Use cases: secure border monitoring, emergency response planning, infrastructure maintenance and technical troubleshooting.Industry-Grade Mixed Reality Headsets and Toolchains for Scalable Enterprise Solutions: High-performance mixed reality headsets, offering comfortable wearability, robust tracking, and industrial-grade durability, became standard gear in many professional fields letting enterprises rapidly create, deploy, and maintain applications - ranging from advanced training simulations for defense personnel to augmented production workflows for automotive manufacturing lines.We believe that these industry developments, coupled with ongoing technological advancements, position the Immersive industry for potential rapid adoption and substantial market expansion in upcoming years. 2025 Expectations:Looking forward, we expect overall revenues to be significantly higher in the coming quarters compared to the past year, resulting in above $3 million/Q revenue on average in the coming quarters. We expect that revenues for 2025 will be well above our revenues for 2024 (for reference, we previously disclosed that we expect our aggregate revenue for FY '25 - ending June 30, 2025 - to be in the $11-12 million range). This expected growth will be primarily driven by an increase in Spatial Core revenues, as well as potential growth in our other businesses.Our Gross Margin should continue to be in the 60-70% range.Post operational restructuring, our current operating cash expense base (pre revenue) is now less than $1 million per month.We expect to be cash flow positive and increase our cash balance throughout the upcoming calendar year, without the need for a capital raise.VRAR StockThe transformational and positive developments achieved in 2024 are not currently reflected in our stock price, creating what we believe is a very significant disconnect between our intrinsic value and our public company valuation.We have a strong position in the Immersive technology segment, AI and Cloud driven revenues, large enterprise and DoD customers, relationships with some of the most successful tech companies in the world, strong pipeline of growing revenues, high gross margins, positive expected cash flow, a clean balance sheet, 10 issued Immersive patents, etc. - yet we have an extremely low market cap and consistent selling pressure on the stock. In essence, we are an abandoned "Nano-Cap" but with top tier customers, partners, IP and technology in an exciting growth industry.The management, board and co-founders of the Company own approximately 33% of the outstanding shares. This group has never sold a share in the Company's history, even after the Glimpse's IPO in 2021, and is determined to maximize shareholder value. It is also a key reason why Glimpse continues to maintain a clean capital structure with no debt, no convertible debt and no preferred equity - a rarity in public companies of our size.This valuation disconnect has had, and continues to have, a substantial negative impact on our ability to execute on our growth strategy. As such, the Board of Directors of the Company is exploring various aggressive strategic options to enable the business to be in a position to invest in its growth while unlocking the value inherent in our business and/or assets and may pursue such options in the future.Summary Remarks We have made major strides over the past year in repositioning and restructuring Glimpse strategically and operationally. It's an exciting time for the Immersive industry, Glimpse is positioned as a leading provider of enterprise Immersive software and services, and we are poised for revenue growth and cash profitability. However, this is not reflected in our stock price, to the great detriment of our growth potential and shareholders. Going forward, we are going to continue our focus on profitable growth and in parallel aggressively explore all strategic options with the goal of unlocking the value of our business and/or underlying assets.

Company Contact: Maydan RothblumCFO & COOThe Glimpse Group, Inc.(917) 292-2685 SOURCE: The Glimpse Group, Inc.View the original press release on accesswire.com 2024 Marked by Strategic Repositioning to Spatial Core AI and Cloud Based Revenues, Significant DoD Contracts, and Positioning Toward Revenue Growth and Profitability NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / December 17, 2024 / The Glimpse Group, Inc. ("Glimpse") (NASDAQ:VRAR)(FSE:9DR), a diversified Immersive Technology platform company providing enterprise-focused Virtual Reality ("VR"), Augmented Reality ("AR") and Spatial Computing software and services, today issued a letter to shareholders from its President & CEO, Lyron Bentovim, summarizing key Glimpse developments for Calendar Year 2024. Dear Shareholders: 2024 was a transformational year for Glimpse, in which we made significant strides in our strategic transition to focus on providing enterprise-scale Spatial Computing, Cloud and AI driven Immersive middleware software and solutions ("Spatial Core") - led by our subsidiary company Brightline Interactive. This successful transition included major contracts with leading U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD") and other large entities, while working directly with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cesium and many others. In parallel, we streamlined our organizational structure and reached a point where we are cash flow profitable from operations. We achieved this milestone without raising capital and while maintaining a clean balance sheet with no debt, converts or preferreds. In fact, we expect our cash balance on December 31, 2024 to match and potentially exceed our cash balance on September 30, 2024 - the first time that has occurred in our history as a public company from internal operations only. The Immersive industry itself also made important progress in 2024, with major initiatives and products announced by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Nvidia, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Samsung (KS:005930), Snap and others. These bode well for the Immersive industry in general and for Glimpse in particular. Spatial Core Summary: In 2023 we commenced on a strategic transition, focusing our investment on Spatial Core. This transition was largely completed during 2024 and Spatial Core is now Glimpse's primary growth engine and value driver. Spatial Core has tremendous potential and has gained strong traction during the year. We are working with some of the leading companies in the world to develop the Immersive middleware that takes in huge amounts of 2D data, creates detailed and life-like digital twins in 3D and then on top of that 3D data makes complex computations inside the digital twin environment while also adding important utility functions, all via the Cloud, in large scale and in real time. Spatial Core is highly relevant and powerful in industries where there is complex 2D data that can be utilized far more effectively in a 3D setting with multiple use cases in Enterprises, Manufacturing, Engineering/Architecture, Oil/Gas, Robotics as well as in Government and the Military. AI is a key element in Spatial Core: Automate the generation of digital twin environments - 2D to 3D, utilizing machine learning and computer vision. Generative AI inside a Spatial Environment - utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to ask functional questions about a descriptive environment. For example, "If I place a building in this location, will I be able to see the other building". Neuro Learning Networks - learn in an immersive environment by performing a function repeatedly, based on visual inputs, and then distribute that learning to all other participants. For example, robots learning to do complex tasks. These AI capabilities, combined with the vast and real time computing available via the Cloud, and delivered via 5G networks are transformative in our ability to create complex and powerful simulations and scenarios, in a cost effective, scalable and effective manner. I encourage you to view the Spatial Core webinar we hosted earlier this year: "The intersection of AI and Spatial Computing, bringing the power of bringing AI into the 3D world": https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2934/51186 Examples of Spatial Core traction include: Signed a $4MM+, 12-month contract with a Department of Defense entity for a Spatial Computing ecosystem, integrating AI workflows and accelerated compute for a variety of defense use-cases. Entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the US Army Combat Capabilities Development Command, Command, Control, Communication, Computers, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Center, to develop, assess and improve workflows to create and augment synthetic imagery for use in training and assessing AI and machine learning Machine learning algorithms. Extended partnership with a Fortune 500 government Systems Integrator for VR Training in Digital Twin Environments to a key U.S. government agency with over 45,000 employees on a mid six figure contract. Brightline Interactive, Cesium & NVIDIA teamed up at the GEOspatial INTelligence Symposium 2024 to introduce Brightline's Spatial Core which uses AI workflows for complex computations on top of real life data sets, enabling powerful real time, massive data driven, digital twin and simulation applications. Successfully Completed the Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the US Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division for the adaptation of immersive technologies. Completed a contract to support a major immersive technology hardware provider to accelerate their computing interfaces into GPU-enabled cloud, with streaming and visualization capabilities. We are at an advanced stage of securing several additional multi-million dollar Spatial Core contracts with multiple Government, DoD and large enterprise customers. The short-term aggregate value for these contracts is in the $5-10 million range. Each of these potential contracts has significant growth elements built into them that could lead to significant annual recurring software revenue once the original contracts have been successfully performed. Other Glimpse Entities Summary: In parallel to Spatial Core, our other Immersive businesses continued their positive momentum. Some examples: Foretell Reality entered into a 6-figure partnership with a large University to develop an AI-driven VR training system enabling students and trainees to learn various professional skills through conversation-centric simulations with an AI-based avatar in different immersive settings. Glimpse Learning entered into a two year, mid-six figure contract with the College of Staten Island CUNY ("CSI") Technology Incubator for the design, deployment and integration of a suite of immersive technologies in its new Innovation Hub. This is a cross Glimpse effort, with a significant software license component In recent months, we have experienced an increase in our revenues with Snap for AR 3D models and lenses. Sector 5 Digital ("S5D") entered into a 6-figure engagement with one of the world's largest architecture firms to visualize in AR the new business campus of a multinational retail company; a mid-six figure contract with a global water and hygiene infrastructure company for an augmented reality (AR) solution; and a mid-six figure contract with a global energy company for Immersive content. Glimpse Learning entered into a multi year, mid-six figure contract with a state district for Immersive education. Immersive Industry: While the Immersive industry, and Glimpse as a significant participant in it, has faced challenging headwinds over the past two years, we are now seeing and experiencing concrete positive growth indicators in both our business and the Immersive industry. We believe that the Immersive industry is poised for significant growth, driven by: Meta's VR gaming platform continues to grow, and their new Ray-Ban AI glasses have exceeded expectations, demonstrating consumer appetite for discreet wearable tech. Apple boldly entered the headset market with the Vision Pro, its initial Spatial headset, signaling their intent to lead the next digital era. Samsung's recent re-entry to the market, leveraging Google's new Immersive operating system, signals a competitive resurgence and further industry maturation. Perhaps the most significant development lies in Meta's "Orion" concept AR headset. This vision of seamlessly integrating digital experiences into the real world represents a fundamental shift in human-computer interaction. This vision is directly correlated with our vison for Spatial Core. Specifically, as it relates to Spatial Core, the following are key industry developments: Matured AR Cloud and Interoperable Standards for Enterprise and Government Workflows: standardized "AR Cloud"- open standards and protocols enable seamless interoperability, allowing different contractors, departments, and partners to integrate and share geospatial data, maintenance records, and situational guidance without being locked into proprietary ecosystems.

Title: SoftBank’s $100 Billion Promise To Trump Is More Than Its Entire Market Cap
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardnieva/2024/12/16/softbank-trump-masayoshi-son-100-billion/
Time Published: 2024-12-17T00:35:35Z

The Japanese tech conglomerate has assets, like a majority stake in British chip company Arm, but hasn’t detailed how it will pony up. SoftBank announced a $100 billion commitment to U.S. projects over the span of Trump's presidency. On Monday, SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son and President-elect Donald Trump jointly announced a bold commitment: The Japanese tech conglomerate aims to invest $100 billion in U.S. projects over the next four years. It was a glitzy pledge from a global tech leader, teaming up with the incoming president with a promise to create at least 100,000 new American jobs in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies. The announcement eclipses a similar one Son made in 2016 as Trump first took office — a $50 billion pledge and 50,000 jobs. “President Trump is a double down president,” Son said during a press conference at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s private residence in Palm Beach, Florida. “I’m going to have to double down.” There’s just one hitch: SoftBank doesn’t actually have $100 billion at the moment. As of market close on Monday, its entire market cap was $97 billion, and it has $29 billion in cash on hand. It’s unclear how the company would finance its pledge and Son didn’t bother to detail how during its announcement. The commitment is over the span of Trump’s presidency, so SoftBank will have years to make good on its promise. The company did fulfill its 2016 vow of $50 billion, with investments in dozens of companies including Slack and DoorDash. It’s more difficult to determine if it created that number of jobs, and the company did not provide an estimate at the end of Trump’s last term. SoftBank didn’t respond to a request for comment. The company’s most valuable asset is a majority stake in Arm Holdings, the British semiconductor company that went public last year. Arm’s market cap is currently $152.6 billion, with SoftBank’s roughly 90% stake valued at $137.3 billion. If liquidated, it would easily cover the company’s commitment. It’s unlikely, of course, that SoftBank would sell off its entire stake. Offloading large amounts of stock would probably cause the share price to crater. It could use its Arm stock as leverage to take out debt that would finance this commitment; but SoftBank has already taken out $8 billion in margin loans against its Arm stock. In reaching into the Arm piggy bank, SoftBank doesn’t want to repeat missteps it took with Alibaba. In 2000, SoftBank invested $20 million in the Chinese ecommerce company, which went public in 2014 in the largest tech IPO ever, raising $25 billion. SoftBank reportedly owned 24% of the company at the time — a stake that dwindled to 7% in 2022, and down to half a percent by last May. SoftBank’s announcement comes as several tech executives have tried to curry favor with Trump as he returns to power. In the last few days, Facebook parent Meta, Amazon and OpenAI have reportedly promised to donate $1 million each to Trump’s inauguration fund. With key supporters like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, Silicon Valley has struck a different tone from when Trump first took office four years ago. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg recently made a visit to Mar-a-Lago, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai reportedly has a visit in the works. SoftBank is best known for its Vision Fund, a $100 billion venture fund it announced in 2017 for investing in tech companies worldwide, with half the funds raised from the sovereign wealth funds of Middle East countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. But the Vision Fund came to be known for misplaced bets, including the ill-fated coworking real estate company WeWork, and Softbank posted an $18 billion loss. In 2020, the activist investor Elliott Management bought a $2.5 billion stake in the Vision Fund and pushed for restructuring and more transparency. By the time Softbank set out to raise more money for a Vision Fund 2, the company had trouble courting investors because of the first fund’s issues. In trying to hit the $100 billion mark, the company could potentially count already-announced commitments to its tally. For example, Softbank reportedly invested another $1.5 billion in OpenAI last month through an employee tender offer. In May, the Japanese company said it would commit $9 billion a year to AI investments, though it didn’t specify where it would make its bets. Trump, who described Son as “one of the most accomplished business leaders of our time,” didn’t seem worried about where the money would come from, and even pushed for more. “I’ve looked at their books and they do have the possibility of doing more,” Trump said Monday. “I’m going to ask them to do a little bit more.” He then challenged Son to double his promise again to $200 billion. While remaining noncommittal, Son laughed and said he would “try to make it happen.” “He’s a great negotiator,” he said. Additional reporting by Iain Martin.

Longtime Wall Street favorite Nvidia extended a rare down stretch, as shares of the artificial intelligence colossus slipped into correction territory, a ding that comes as Nvidia’s trillion-dollar peers enjoy a robust period of gains. A Nvidia display in Shanghai. Nvidia stock fell 1.7% Monday to $132, its lowest end-of-day share price since Oct. 15. That’s 11% below the stock’s all-time closing high of $149 set Nov. 7, officially heading into a correction. Monday’s losses moved against a broader rally for technology stocks, with the Nasdaq index gaining 1.2% to a new record. And shares of each of the six other most valuable American companies – the other members of the “Magnificent Seven” group including Apple, Amazon, Facebook parent Meta, Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla – gained at least 0.7% apiece, led by Tesla’s 6% rise. 5.7%. That’s how much shares of Nvidia are down since Election Day, far underperforming the S&P 500 index’s 5% gain during the period. Notably, the six-week stretch has been a strong one for Nvidia’s big tech peers, as each of the other Magnificent Seven stocks advanced at least 9.9%. There has been no singular catalyst for the Nvidia selloff – its earnings report last month exceeded analyst estimates across the board – though the stock has previously slumped due to geopolitical fears from Nvidia’s reliance on Taiwanese manufacturers. The recent dip for Nvidia shares may be hard to digest for investors, especially in an otherwise rosy market, but the stock’s longer-term returns are still eye popping. Nvidia’s 170% year-to-date return is the best of any company valued at more than $200 billion, according to FactSet data, with shares up a whopping 700% over the last two years. Nvidia rose to prominence over the last two years as the unquestioned market leader in designing the semiconductor technology powering generative AI, causing its market capitalization to grow from below $300 billion in late 2022 to as high as $3.6 trillion last month. Nvidia, whose clientele includes Amazon and Microsoft, translated the surging interest in generative AI into a significant upswing in its financial performance, as sales grew by more than 600% during Nvidia’s most recent quarter compared to 2022’s comparable period. Nvidia is still the third-largest company in the world by market value, trailing only Apple and Microsoft. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

The latest rally was spurred by Broadcom's better-than-expected earnings report late Thursday, and an uplifting outlook for the first quarter. Broadcom, which sells semiconductors and infrastructure software, is seeing soaring demand from the boom in generative artificial intelligence and reported a 220% jump in AI revenue for the year to $12.2 billion. Goldman Sachs analysts, who recommend buying Broadcom shares, lifted their 12-month target to $240 from $190, citing additional large customers for custom silicon. They also referenced management's execution following the $61 billion purchase of VMware, which closed last year. "We now have even higher conviction on the company's forward revenue and earnings growth outlook," the analysts wrote in a report dated Dec. 15. Barclays raised its priced target on the stock to $205 from $200, while Truist raised its call to $260 from $245. Broadcom shares are now up 126% for the year, closing at $250 on Monday. Nvidia, which has been the primary beneficiary of the AI craze due to the popularity of its graphics processing units, or GPUs, is up more than 165% this year, reaching a market cap of $3.2 trillion. The Nasdaq has gained 34%. Broadcom refers to its custom AI accelerators as XPUs, which are different than the GPUs Nvidia sells. Broadcom said it doubled shipments of XPUs in the quarter to "our three hyperscale customers." The company does not name the customers, but analysts say the three are Meta, Alphabet and TikTok parent ByteDance.

Title: 3 Enormous Supercomputers May Now Be In The Works

[+] chip visible in the background, in this photo illustration taken in Brussels, Belgium, on December 30, 2023. (Photo by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images) When I wrote about XAI’s Colossus project a few weeks ago, the scale of the initiative seemed, for lack of a better word, dizzying. You can look back at the video with Patrick from ServetheHome leading the audience through the halls of a supercomputing cluster ostensibly created to power XAI’s Grok chatbot: you can see row after row, rack after rack, of processors set in powerful motion, like a massive army, marching in lock-step and served with enormous amounts of electricity and water. According to recent news, a major vendor of AI hardware is now claiming that three of its major customers are planning projects on the colossal scale of Colossus. Broadcom reports that no fewer than three of its clients may develop data centers with 1,000,000 processors by 2027. This came from the company Q4 earnings call Dec 12, where leaders cited a 220% spike in revenue for the year. "As you know, we currently have three hyperscale customers who have developed their own multi-generational AI XPU roadmap to be deployed at varying rates over the next three years," President and CEO of Broadcom Hock Tan reportedly said on the call. "In 2027, we believe each of them plans to deploy 1,000,000 XPU clusters across a single fabric." For reference, Colossus started by reporting a need of 100,000 GPUs. After quickly doubling that order, Musk then came out with the frank update: that the center would require a cool million of the Nvidia GPUs that run there. Industry leaders like Jensen Huang marveled over the breakneck pace of the data center’s construction: so did notable journalists. It seemed like a unicorn. But is this kind of project, within the next few years, going to become de rigueur? The available reporting clarifies that there are no specific identifications of who is planning these enormous designs. Ask ChatGPT, and it will confirm this, although the model does give a list of top companies that it believes are more capable of scaling up these kinds of plans, including: · Nvidia · Microsoft · Amazon Web Services · Google · OpenAI · Meta · Tesla In addition, ChatGPT cites a collection of Chinese companies that have their own large data center capabilities, including Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu. When you dig a little deeper, it looks like most of these companies are pretty far from this metric. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg has publicly said that the company is aiming for about 350,000 data center GPUs by the end of this year. Google has estimated a total of 2 million GPUs in all of its global operations, not just one center. As for major clusters at AWS, where the hardware provides B2B services, one of the official numbers is that AWS has built a virtual supercomputer performing 9.95 petaflops, which looks like it would require a couple of hundred Nvidia H100s. So a million GPUs is still a really big deal. While the news is impressive, some are likely to be less than enthused about the idea of multiple data centers of this size. If we go back to Colossus, we have critics on the record talking about what they fear in terms of resource competition by this power-hungry behemoth. For one thing, Colossus is estimated to need up to 1,000,000 gallons of water per day - where you often see per capita municipal usage of around 100 gallons per day. There’s also the use of natural gas turbines to provide all of that energy… Experts have been suggesting for a while now that the U.S. is poised to expand nuclear power infrastructure, in order to power data centers, and specifically, to locate the power sources right next to the superclusters in order to make things more efficient. But even if they’re 100% efficient, it’s obvious that the power needs are going to be immense. As key journalists and others covering this issue have been pointing out, things are moving at an incredibly rapid pace. We’re going to have to figure out what impact these supercomputers are making on our society, because even though Colossus is the only one publicly identified as in the works, others are likely to be here soon.

December 16, 2024 06:30 ET | Source: Radisson Mining Resources Inc. Radisson Mining Resources Inc. ROUYN-NORANDA, Quebec, Dec. 16, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Radisson Mining Resources Inc. (TSX-V: RDS, OTCQB: RMRDF) (“Radisson” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce results from an important diamond drill hole at its 100%-owned O’Brien Gold Project (“O’Brien” or the “Project”) located in the Abitibi region of Québec. OB-24-337 is an exploratory hole drilled to a depth of 1,700 metres, the deepest hole ever drilled at the Project and the first hole drilled directly below the historic O’Brien Mine workings. At approximately 1,500 metres vertical depth it intersected sheared and mineralized rocks of the Piché Group, the dominant host rocks for O’Brien gold mineralization, and returned 242.0 g/t gold (“Au”) over 1.0 metre within a mineralized interval that averaged 31.24 g/t Au over 8.0 metres. Matt Manson, President and CEO, commented: “Following our “Jewellery Box” re-discovery news of December 9, 2024, we are taking the unusual step of releasing assays from another single drill hole today because of its particular significance to the future of the O’Brien Gold Project. Hole OB-24-337 was intended to be a pilot hole testing whether the Project’s host geology extended below the historic mine and to be a platform for future wedging and directional drilling. The fact that this hole intersected mineralization and visible gold at such a high grade greatly exceeded our expectations. Recall that approximately 75% of our existing Mineral Resource is defined at depths above 600 metres. On September 24th we announced that drill hole OB-24-324 had intersected 27.61 g/t Au over 6.0 metres at 1,100 metres vertical depth. Now, we have new gold mineralization in a classic O’Brien setting at 1,500 metres vertical depth, a full 500 metres below the deepest workings of the old mine. It is clear that O’Brien gold mineralization is extensive at depth, implying significant future upside potential for the Project.” Figure 1: Visible Gold in Drill Hole OB-24-337 Figure 2: Long Section in Oblique View of Gold Vein Mineralization and Mineral Resources at the O’Brien Gold Project, with Drill Hole OB-337 and Other Recent Deep Drill Holes Illustrated. Table 1: Detailed Assay Results from Drill Hole OB-24-337 Notes on Calculation of Drill Intercepts:The O’Brien Gold Project March 2023 Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”) utilizes a 4.50 g/t Au bottom cutoff, a US$1600 gold price, a minimum mining width of 1.2 metres, and a 40 g/t Au upper cap on composites. Intercepts from drill hole OB-24-337 presented in Table 1 are calculated with a 1.00 g/t bottom cut-off over a minimum 1.0 metre core length so as to illustrate the frequency and continuity of mineralized intervals within which high-grade gold veins at O’Brien are developed. Intercepts presented in the deep drill hole compilation in Table 2 are calculated with a 3.00 g/t Au bottom cut-off, representing the lower limit of cut-off sensitivity presented in the March 2023 Mineral Resource Estimate. Sample grades are uncapped. True widths, based on depth of intercept and drill hole inclination, are estimated to be 30-70% of core length.

See “Notes on Calculation of Drill Intercepts”) Notes Deep Drill Holes OB-24-321 and OB-24 324W2 did not return any intercepts >3 g/t Au Figure 3: Cross Section of the Historic O’Brien Mine Locating Drill Hole OB-24-337 Recent Deep Drilling Results Today’s results from deep drill hole OB-24-337 are from the third batch of drill results released since September that have shown high grade O’Brien gold mineralization within Piché Group rocks well below the base of the existing Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”). Seven deep drill holes or drill hole wedges have been completed since this time. Six of the seven returned instances of visible gold and five of the seven returned drill intercepts well above the Project’s grade cutoff in the March 2023 MRE. The holes were drilled at northerly declinations with initial inclinations of between -65 and -85 degrees, followed by angling to provide a high angle of incidence with the southerly dip of the Piché Group rocks and vein mineralization. Estimated true widths of drill intercepts at the point of contact with mineralization is estimated to be 30-70% of core length. Deep drill results since September 2024, summarized in Table 2, have now included: and now: The frequency and grade of intercepts returned by these deep drill holes, as well as the observed host geology, its deformation, the style of alteration, and the mineralogical association of the gold mineralization, are all familiar from the historical O’Brien mine and consistent with the modern geological model developed at shallower depths. The implication is that characteristic O’Brien style gold mineralization is extensive at depth, well below the level of the historic mine workings and the current MRE. Gold Mineralization at O’Brien Gold mineralizing quartz-sulphide veins at O’Brien occur within a thin band of interlayered mafic volcanic rocks, conglomerates, and porphyric andesitic sills of the Piché Group occurring in contact with the east-west oriented Larder Lake-Cadillac Break (“LLCB”). Gold, along with pyrite and arsenopyrite, is typically associated with shearing and a pervasive biotite alteration, and developed within multiple Piché Group lithologies and, occasionally, the hanging-wall Pontiac and footwall Cadillac meta-sedimentary rocks. As mapped at the historic O’Brien mine, and now replicated in the modern drilling, individual veins are generally narrow, ranging from several centimetres up to several metres in thickness. Multiple veins occur sub-parallel to each other, as well as sub-parallel to the Piché lithologies and the LLCB. Individual veins have well-established lateral continuity, with near-vertical, high-grade shoots developed over significant lengths. The historic O’Brien mine produced over half a million ounces of gold from such veins and shoots at an average grade exceeding 15 g/t and over a vertical extent of at least 1,000 metres. Based on drilling complete to the end of 2022, the Project has estimated Indicated Mineral Resources of 0.50 million ounces (1.52 million tonnes at 10.26 g/t Au), with additional Inferred Mineral Resources of 0.45 million ounces (1.60 million tonnes at 8.66 g/t Au). Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Current exploration is focussed on delineating well developed vein mineralization to the east of the historic mine, with additional high-grade shoots becoming evident in the exploration data over what has been described as a series of repeating trends (“Trend #s 0 to 5”). Table 3: Drill Hole Collar Information for Holes contained in this News Release QA/QC All drill cores in this campaign are NQ in size.

Cybersecurity researchers are calling attention to a new kind of investment scam that leverages a combination of social media malvertising, company-branded posts, and artificial intelligence (AI) powered video testimonials featuring famous personalities, ultimately leading to financial and data loss. "The main goal of the fraudsters is to lead victims to phishing websites and forms that harvest their personal information," ESET noted in its H2 2024 Threat Report shared with The Hacker News. The Slovak cybersecurity company is tracking the threat under the name Nomani, a play on the phrase "no money." It said the scam grew by over 335% between H1 and H2 2024, with more than 100 new URLs detected daily on average between May and November 2024. The attacks play out through fraudulent ads on social media platforms, in several cases targeting people who have previously been scammed by making use of Europol- and INTERPOL-related lures about contacting them for help or getting their stolen money refunded by clicking on a link. These ads are published from a mix of fake and stolen legitimate profiles associated with small businesses, governmental entities, and micro-influencers with tens of thousands of followers. Other distribution channels include sharing these posts on Messenger and Threads, as well as sharing deceptively positive reviews on Google. "Another large group of accounts frequently spreading Nomani ads are newly created profiles with easy-to-forget names, a handful of followers, and very few posts," ESET pointed out. The websites these links direct to have been found to request for their contact information and visually imitate local news media; abuse logos and branding of specific organizations; or claim to advertise cryptocurrency management solutions with ever-changing names such as Quantum Bumex, Immediate Mator, or Bitcoin Trader. In the next step, cybercriminals use the data gathered from the phishing domains to directly call the victims and manipulate them into investing their money into non-existent investment products that falsely show phenomenal gains. In some cases, victims are duped into taking out loans or installing remote access apps on their devices. "When these victim 'investors' request payout of the promised profits, the scammers force them to pay additional fees and to provide further personal information such as ID and credit card information," ESET said. "In the end, the fraudsters take both the money and data and disappear – following the typical pig butchering scam." There is evidence to suggest that Nomani is the work of Russian-speaking threat actors given the presence of source code comments in Cyrillic and the use of Yandex tools for visitor tracking. Similar to major scam operations like Telekopye, it's suspected that there are different groups who are in charge of managing each and every aspect of the attack chain: Theft, creation, and abuse of Meta accounts and ads, building the phishing infrastructure, and running the call centers. "By using social engineering techniques and building trust with the victims, scammers often outmaneuver even the authorization mechanisms and verification phone calls the banks use to prevent fraud," ESET said. The development comes as South Korean law enforcement authorities said they took down a large-scale fraud network that defrauded nearly $6.3 million from victims with fake online trading platforms as part of an operation called MIDAS. More than 20 servers utilized by the fraud ring have been seized and 32 people involved in the scheme have been arrested. Besides luring victims with SMS and phone calls, users of the illicit home trading system (HTS) programs were enticed into investing their funds by watching YouTube videos and joining KakaoTalk chat rooms. "The program communicates with the servers of real brokerage firms to get real-time stock price information, and uses publicly available chart libraries to create visual representations," the Financial Security Institute (K-FSI) said in a presentation given at the Black Hat Europe conference last week. "However, no actual stock trades are made. Rather, the program's core feature, a screen capture function, is used to spy on users' screens, collect unauthorized information, and refuse to return money."

Title: Webscale Network Operators Exhibit Robust Growth and Investment in Q3 2024

December 16, 2024 05:14 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Dec. 16, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Webscale Network Operators: 3Q24 Market Review" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. This report reviews the growth and development of the webscale network operator (WNO, or webscale) market since 2011. It covers 21 companies. In the most recent 12 months (4Q23-3Q24), webscalers represented $2.53 trillion (T) in revenues (+9.1% YoY), $307 billion (B) in R&D spending (+6.5% YoY), and $254B in capex (+32.5% YoY). They had $631B of cash and short-term investments (-11.3% YoY) on the books as of September 2024, and $538B in total debt (-4.1% YoY). The value of webscalers' net plant, property & equipment (net PP&E) on the books as of September 2024 was $854B, up 25.9% YoY. Webscalers employed approximately 4.226 million (M) people at the end of 3Q24, up 2.3% from the Sept. 2023 total of 4.130M. Key Report Highlights: Revenues: Single quarter revenues in 3Q24 were $638.6 billion (B), up 10.6% YoY. That pushed annualized revenues to $2.527 trillion. Topline growth has been driven by the big 4: Alphabet, Amazon, Meta (FB) and Microsoft. For five straight quarters, all of these companies have recorded double digit revenue growth, well above the rest of the pack. For the 3Q24 annualized period, the fastest growth came from Meta, up 23.1% versus 4Q22-3Q23, followed by Microsoft (+16.4%), Alphabet (14.4%), and Amazon (11.9%). The biggest dollar impact on growth in 3Q24 came from Amazon, as its single quarter revenues grew $15.8 billion from 3Q23 to end 3Q24 at $158.9B, up 11.0% YoY. The only curb on growth in 3Q24 was Japanese IT services & cloud vendor Fujitsu, which recorded 3Q24 revenues of $5.8B, down $492 million (M) YoY (-7.8%). Capex: After declining 5% in 2023, webscale capex has grown at incredibly fast, unsustainable rates in 2024: up by 25%, 51%, and 58% YoY in the first three quarters of the year. 3Q24 capex of $75.6B pushed the annualized total to $253.9B, up 32.5% YoY, and another all-time high. Investor interest in generative AI has spread rapidly, driving GPU spend in the data center. The current investment spike would seem to be inspired by a mix of hype and fear of missing out, as GenAI brings with it a plethora of legal & regulatory risks and relative lack of proven business models. Most recent webscale capex is focused on outfitting existing data centers: from 46% of annualized capex in 3Q22, Network/IT and software capex was 53% of total capex for the latest annualized period. The biggest capex outlays in 3Q24 came from Amazon ($22.6B), Microsoft ($14.9B), Alphabet ($13.1B), and Meta (FB) ($8.3B). These four account for about 80% of single quarter spending. They are the reason behind the unsustainable surge in the price of NVIDIA stock. Profitability: Webscale free cash flow margins averaged out to 17.6% for the 3Q24 annualized period, a bit lower than a year prior (17.9%) but higher than the 14.1% booked in 3Q22. Average net profit margin for 4Q23-3Q24 was 18.9%, a bit higher than 16.9% in 3Q23. Both profitability metrics are around the same level as in the year before COVID. Meta, Tencent and Microsoft are regularly near or at the top of the heap on both metrics, and this was again the case in 3Q24. The ecommerce specialists Amazon and Alibaba are the laggards, as usual. The biggest drops in free cash flow margins came at the companies with surging capex: Alphabet and Amazon. The biggest decline in net profitability was Apple, which was fined 13 billion Euros in September 2024 for taking illegal profits from a tax scheme in Ireland over two decades. This tax scheme has been widely known about and criticized for many years. While 13 billion sounds like a lot, it hardly impacted Apple's market trajectory at all. Apple's stock price is around 14% higher now than on 1 July 2024. Consumers and taxpayers are losing out, while big tech uses political friends to secure victories. This will get worse with new political leadership in the US. Employees: Headcount in the webscale market totaled to 4.23 million in September 2024, slightly up from 4.13 million in September 2023. This difference is negligible, considering the size of some of the webscalers and how quickly the ecommerce specialists in particular can change workforce levels. Amazon's workforce grew by 51,000 between September 2023 and 2024, for instance. Total webscale headcount has been approximately 4.1 to 4.2 million or so steadily since late 2021. Some of the biggest webscalers are investing heavily in AI and GenAI, with one clear goal being to improve their internal cost efficiencies. This inevitably will mean fewer employees. Even within the ecommerce space, there is a rising use of robots and autonomous vehicles in the logistics chain. Per our latest forecast, we expect webscale employment to rise slightly in 2025 but decline thereafter due to greater use of robotics, automation and AI. Regional trends: The Asia-Pacific region has been a drag on the market for several quarters, and that continued in 3Q24. Webscale revenues in the Americas, Europe, and MEA have been growing in the low double digit range for a few quarters, but AP has been weak: 3Q24 revenue growth was 5% YoY, in line with the last few quarters of low single digit percentage growth. Weak Asian currencies and a very competitive 'big tech' market in China account for the gap. Another factor is TikTok. This company, owned by ByteDance, has grown at explosive rates for the last few years, but remains private. We have no reasonable way to include TikTok figures in our database. The ByteDance surge also ate into the 2022-23 growth of some western webscalers, notably Meta (FB), but that effect has ebbed.

Title: The hefty bill for the banks, the MPs’ initiatives, and the whining about the Metro, the disgrace of the TV-lawyer, and the billionaire’s financial strains

Time Published: 2024-12-16T09:38:57Z
Full Content:
Greetings, well, it’s well-known that when K.M. takes charge of something, he doesn’t make mistakes or do sloppy work. That’s what happened yesterday during the budget discussion, where the measures he announced for the banks outshone any proposals from the opposition. But he also gave a social touch by imposing a “mandatory donation” of 100 million euros from the banks to support school infrastructure. So, Kyriakos Mitsotakis took things a step further and caught the bankers off guard with yesterday’s announcements. On fees for basic transactions (bill payments, dealings with the public sector, etc.), we’re looking at a complete elimination—not mere reductions, as initially expected. This is estimated to cost banks about 120 million euros annually, alongside the ENFIA (property tax) adjustment, as the Prime Minister mentioned legislative provisions to make this permanent. Add 100 million euros for the body that will manage properties of vulnerable borrowers and another 100 million for funding the renovation and construction of new schools, and the ENFIA adjustment. Altogether, the bill handed to the banks yesterday amounts to approximately 320 million euros. K.M.’s announcements, such as covering pharmaceutical expenses for low-income pensioners and granting a hazard allowance for uniformed personnel, were initially proposals from New Democracy MPs. Back then, they were labeled as “rebellious” initiatives, but the Maximos Mansion didn’t “criminalize” the suggestions. Instead, it processed them and is now implementing them. This way, the government showcases tangible actions, and the MPs can boast to their constituents that they influenced governmental decisions. The other day, there was a technical failure on a Thessaloniki Metro train. Passengers were inconvenienced, having to walk along the tunnel’s emergency corridor, which is specifically designed for such situations. The whole power outage lasted about 90 minutes, but the actual inconvenience for passengers was much shorter. Nobody truly claimed there was any risk to people because the power cut affected a Metro train. Yet, in Parliament, PASOK, SYRIZA, and the New Left (especially Haritsis, who pretends to be “modern”) raised a huge fuss. Honestly, I don’t think there’s another country in Europe where the opposition collectively blows up over a power cut in a single train on a completely new Metro system (and therefore bound to have some technical glitches). We’re talking about sheer ridiculousness! Six months ago, on a Sunday afternoon in early summer, the public was bombarded with reports about the arrest of a well-known TV lawyer who had almost beaten his wife and mother of his children to death. Initially, there were absurd excuses he gave during the investigation—claims that she “fell down the stairs”—but soon, under pressure from the police and investigators, she revealed the horrific truth. There was explosive media coverage for a few days. The coroner’s report revealed brutal beatings (17 punches to a woman’s face!). There were also dubious claims of psychiatric issues, and eventually, the whole thing faded out of the spotlight. Fast forward six months—before the year even ends—and this monster of a lawyer is appearing on TV shows as an angel. Look, here’s his new home, his new partner, and praise for his severely beaten ex-wife as a good mother, and so on. And life goes on. Now, you tell me: with a government that boasts laws against domestic violence and a justice system like ours, can anyone believe that things are improving in this country? Rot and corruption, or just the overwhelming sense that, in the end, everything here gets swept under the rug and left “half-resolved”? We still don’t have any progress on the issue of abolishing the Public Sector’s special rights in its 8.4% stake in the National Bank of Greece. The delay didn’t come from the Finance Ministry or the HFSF (Hellenic Financial Stability Fund). From the Greek side, all procedures are complete, and the delay stems from discussions between the ESM and SSM. The SSM doesn’t oppose abolishing the special rights, but the ESM wants to handle the matter in a way that fully safeguards their interests. So, it’s just a matter of time. Financial constraints—let’s put it politely—are plaguing the billionaire (?) Beny Steinmetz, also known as the “diamond king.” Word in the market is that he sold one of his two mines in Guinea (the operational one), as well as the nickel plant he owned in Skopje. Regarding the refinery in Italy, which even got the attention of the Financial Times, it was eventually bought by shipping magnate G. Economou because Steinmetz couldn’t come up with 140 million euros at the time. I’m telling you this to keep you informed since Greece doesn’t have many billionaires, and Steinmetz is one of them. Aside from being the diamond king, he’s also the king of arrests at airports (Israel, Cyprus, etc.), thanks to warrants against him. So, he’s spending his time in our country—not that he’s suffering, as he splits his days between a residence in Vouliagmeni (owned by a well-known Greek businessman) and his yacht. The regional airports packaged together Ultimately, the 22 regional airports will be granted as a single “package” to one operator. These airports will be released from the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (HCAP) for concession via an international tender in the first half of 2025. Advisors for the tender have already conducted on-site inspections of the airport cluster (Karpathos, Chios, Alexandroupolis, Araxos, Limnos, Ioannina, Milos, Naxos, Paros, Ikaria, Kythira, Leros, Sitia, Nea Anchialos, Kalymnos, Skyros, Syros, Astypalaia, Kastellorizo, Kastoria, Kasos, and Kozani) to assess their current condition and identify needs to structure the tender framework. There is also consideration for some of these airports to be utilized for cargo transport or charter flights. Additionally, there is an intention for HCAP to retain a stake in the airports, similar to the Kalamata airport case. However, some issues remain unresolved, such as matters involving the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), though HCAP estimates that the concession process will be completed by the end of 2027. The €765 million PPP for the prisons In April, bids are expected to be invited from interested companies for the major €765 million Public-Private Partnership (PPP) project involving the relocation of Korydallos prison to Aspropyrgos. A prerequisite is the approval of the environmental terms. A positive development is the recent approval of a special urban planning framework. The project, managed by the Recovery Fund’s Maturity Unit on behalf of the Ministry of Citizen Protection, involves partnering with a private entity for the design, construction, and maintenance of the facility for up to 30 years. Interest has been expressed by companies such as GEK Terna, Mytilineos, Aktor Concessions, and Avax, with the competitive dialogue nearing completion. The prisons will be relocated to a 100-acre property at the site of the former “American Convenience” military base in Aspropyrgos. The new premises and infrastructure for the modern Judicial Correctional Institution of Athens (JCIA) and the Attica Court Transfer Directorate (ACTD) will be located on the site of the old NATO base. End of an era Last year, Allianz stated that Christos Georgakopoulos, the founder of European Reliance, would remain a member of the board and an administrative advisor. However, his departure from the board of European Reliance-Allianz has quietly marked the end of his tenure. Tensions had arisen anyway, stemming from cultural differences between the German insurance giant and the Greek company. ADMIE board’s term extended Before the stock market opens today, ADMIE (the Independent Power Transmission Operator) will close the cycle of announcements for its nine-month results. Although the third-quarter financials are being released in mid-December, significantly late, they maintain expectations for a distribution of the remaining €14.5 million in dividends in September, along with the pre-dividend of €13.5 million. However, the key highlight is that by this time next year, the electrical connection between Attica and Crete will have been completed, generating an additional €770 million in annual revenue for ADMIE. Following the publication of the nine-month financial statements, a letter will be sent to shareholders regarding the renewal of the current administration’s term, resolving the final pending matter of the year. ECB halts bond purchases starting today Starting today, the European Central Bank (ECB) will permanently cease repurchasing bonds issued under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP). This marks the ECB’s withdrawal from the European bond market as the largest buyer of eurozone countries’ debt. The ECB launched PEPP in March 2020 following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, reaching a peak portfolio of €1.72 trillion two years later. Bond reinvestments were scaled back in July and officially end today, as the ECB wraps up for the holiday season. From now on, each issuer of debt—i.e., each individual country—will have to manage market fears and expectations, which will dictate the pricing of their bonds. The biggest challenge will likely be faced by France, where 52% of its public debt is managed by foreign investors and funds. France’s public debt already stands at 118% of GDP, and Paris will be seeking more than €300 billion (!) in 2025. Greece, on the other hand, appears to have managed its situation, with the €8 billion it needs to borrow next year not expected to pose a problem. The Public Debt Management Agency (PDMA) has planned only two new short-term bond issues and 10 re-issues on agreed dates. Industrial parks The prepayment (40% of the subsidy) from the Recovery Fund has been disbursed to ETBA Industrial Parks S.A. for the business plan aimed at developing industrial parks. elvoX automotive | mobility | technology is a Greek startup that designs and develops electric commercial vehicles—vans. Based in Acharnes, the elvoX team is striving to bring electric innovation to the commercial vehicle market. Reports suggest that this Greek startup has already attracted the interest of angel investors, mainly from the Middle East, for the development of its pioneering electric vehicles designed to meet the needs of urban and suburban professional transport, with the potential for future autonomous operation. Foreign investors are using Greece as a pilot “entry point” for research and development, prototype completion, and—if all goes well—the initiation of electric van production in Greece for the European market. Last Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 86 points (-0.2%), marking its 7th consecutive session of losses. This is the longest losing streak for the blue-chip index in nearly five years. This is happening during a period of general stock market euphoria on the other side of the Atlantic, where 46% of investors predict further price increases. However, at the same time, there have been record stock sales by major shareholders of Wall Street’s “champions.” For example, Jeff Bezos of Amazon sold $1.25 billion worth of his company’s shares in November. In total, in 2024, Amazon’s founder and his close associates sold $12.5 billion worth of shares. Last week, Mark Zuckerberg liquidated another block of Meta shares worth $153 million. In 2024 alone, Zuckerberg sold shares of the company he founded worth approximately $2.4 billion. Meta is now valued at over $1.5 trillion for the first time in history, and the S&P 500 index appears poised to end the year with annual gains of around 24% or more. Meanwhile, top executives at NVIDIA have also announced stock sales worth $1.85 billion this year. A total of about 11 million NVIDIA shares have been sold since the start of the year, the most of any single company. Jensen Huang, NVIDIA’s CEO, revealed he sold 6 million shares. The question remains: who knows better? Those selling shares of the companies they lead, or those buying them? The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the FED will conclude its two-day meeting this coming Wednesday. Markets have already priced in a quarter-point reduction in the federal funds rate. Things will get more interesting next year, with less consensus on how the FED should address persistent inflation amidst concerns about economic growth. But that’s a problem for next year. For now, investors have the holiday season to look forward to. The Bank of England and the Bank of Japan will announce their monetary policy decisions on Thursday. However, Jerome Powell’s problem is much more complex. Currently, the average interest rate on U.S. government debt is 3.4%, the highest since 2008. The U.S. government is paying heavily for its borrowing. Over the last two years, U.S. debt interest rates have more than doubled. About $6.4 trillion of U.S. debt is in treasury bills with an average interest rate of 4.7%, while $14.4 trillion is in government bonds with an average interest rate of 2.8%. In reality, the total net interest cost reached an annualized record pace of $1.1 trillion in the third quarter of 2024. The U.S. government is spending $3 billion EVERY DAY just on interest payments. This may very well be the only reason Powell feels compelled to reduce dollar interest rates… Explore related questions

We've rounded up deals on Batman Lego sets, Blu-ray box sets, and the Meta Quest 3S Batman: Arkham Shadow bundle below the omnibus. $82 ($150) After Batman: Arkham Asylum became a huge hit in 2009, DC Comics didn't waste any time creating extra content for fans to dig into.

The full list for this collection includes: These are all great miniseries and one-shots featuring several of DC's best creators at the helm, and Batman: Arkham Unhinged is notable for being a digital-first series that has been added to this collection. While it was later reprinted in traditional comic book form, it is nice to have it included with the other series in this omnibus. Another cool thing about this hardcover is that the Arkham City series was illustrated by Carlos D'Anda, who worked with Rocksteady to create several unique redesigns for Batman and his rogues gallery in the Arkham games.

U.S. stock indexes drifted through mixed trading ahead of a meeting by the Federal Reserve later this week that could set Wall Street’s direction into next year NEW YORK -- U.S. stock indexes drifted amid mixed trading Monday, ahead of this week’s upcoming meeting by the Federal Reserve that could set Wall Street’s direction into next year. The S&P 500 rose 0.4%, coming off its first losing week in the last four. The Nasdaq composite climbed 1.2% to a record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was a laggard and fell 110 points, or 0.3%. Broadcom leaped 11.2% to help lead the S&P 500 for a second straight day after delivering a profit report last week that beat analysts’ expectations. The technology company is riding a wave of enthusiasm about its artificial-intelligence offerings in particular. The market’s main event, though, will arrive on Wednesday when the Federal Reserve will announce its last move on interest rates for the year. The widespread expectation is that it will cut its main rate for a third straight time, as it tries to boost the slowing job market after getting inflation nearly all the way down to its target of 2%. The question is how much more it will cut rates next year, and Fed officials will release projections for where they see the federal funds rate ending 2025, along with other economic indicators, once their meeting concludes. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will also answer questions in a press conference following the meeting. For now, the general expectation among traders is that the Fed may cut a couple more times in 2025, according to data from CME Group. But such expectations have been shrinking following reports suggesting inflation may be tougher to get all the way down to 2% from here. Besides last month’s slight acceleration in inflation, another worry is that President-elect Donald Trump’s preferences for tariffs and other policies could lead to higher inflation down the line. Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle has dropped his earlier forecast of a cut by the Fed in January, for example. Beyond the possibility of tariffs, he said Fed officials may also want to slow their cuts because of uncertainty about exactly how low rates need to go so that they no longer press the brakes on the economy. Expectations for a series of cuts to rates by the Fed have been one of the main reasons the S&P 500 has set an all-time high 57 times so far this year and is heading for one of its best years of the millennium. The economy has held up better than many feared, continuing to grow even after the Fed hiked the federal funds rate to a two-decade high in hopes of grinding down on inflation, which topped 9% two summers ago. On Wall Street, MicroStrategy jumped as much as 7% during the day as it continues to benefit from the surging price for bitcoin, which set another all-time high. But its stock ended the day down by les than 0.1% after bitcoin’s price pulled back below $106,000 after setting a record above $107,700, according to CoinDesk. The software company has been building its hoard of the cryptocurrency, and its stock price has more than sextupled this year. It will also soon join the Nasdaq 100 index. Bitcoin’s price has catapulted from roughly $44,000 at the start of the year, riding a recent wave of enthusiasm that Trump will create a system that’s more favorable to digital currencies. Honeywell rose 3.7% after saying it’s still considering a spin-off or sale of its aerospace business, as part of a review of its overall business. It said it plans to give an update with the release of its fourth-quarter results. They helped offset a drop for Nvidia, whose chips are powering much of the world’s move into AI. Its stock fell 1.7%. Because it’s grown so massive, with a total value topping $3 trillion, it was the single heaviest weight on the S&P 500. All told, the S&P 500 rose 22.99 points to 6,074.08. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 110.58 to 43,717.48, and the Nasdaq composite rose 247.17 to 20,173.89. In the bond market, Treasury yields held relatively steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 4.39% from 4.40% late Friday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, eased to 4.24% from 4.25%. In stock markets abroad, indexes fell modestly across much of Europe and Asia. They sank 0.9% in Hong Kong and 0.2% in Shanghai after China reported lackluster economic indicators for November despite attempts to strengthen the world’s second-largest economy. South Korea’s Kospi fell 0.2% as law enforcement authorities pushed to summon impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol for questioning over his short-lived martial law decree, and the Constitutional Court met to discuss whether to remove him from office or reinstate him. ___ AP Business Writer Elaine Kurtenbach contributed. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

U.S. stock indexes drifted through mixed trading ahead of a meeting by the Federal Reserve later this week that could set Wall Street’s direction into next year NEW YORK -- U.S. stock indexes drifted amid mixed trading Monday, ahead of this week’s upcoming meeting by the Federal Reserve that could set Wall Street’s direction into next year.

The Nasdaq outperformsU.S. stocks ended Friday mixed. The S&P 500 was flat, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2% for its seventh straight day of losses and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.12%. Shares of Broadcom jumped 24%, launching it into the trillion-dollar market capitalization club. Europe's regional Stoxx 600 fell 0.53% to end the week in the red, snapping a three-week winning streak. OpenAI opens up about MuskOpenAI co-founder Elon Musk pushed to create a new for-profit structure for the company in 2017, OpenAI alleged in a blog post. However, "when he didn't get majority equity and full control, he walked away," wrote OpenAI alongside screenshots of Musk's email. In November, Musk asked a federal court to block OpenAI from converting to a for-profit entity. Tech companies donate to TrumpTechnology companies that have a history of clashes with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump are donating to his inauguration. Meta donated $1 million, the company confirmed to CNBC, Amazon is planning to donate the same amount, according to The Wall Street Journal and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is making a personal donation also of the same amount, according to the company. South Korea president impeachedSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached on Saturday after 204 lawmakers in the National Assembly voted in favor of the motion. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo will serve as acting president. On Sunday, Han spoke with U.S. President Joe Biden, and the country's finance ministry said it would continue monitoring markets. [PRO] Eyes on rates and pricesInterest rates and inflation are in focus this week. The U.S. Federal Reserve's rate-setting meeting ends Wednesday, while the personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation because it reflects how consumers actually spend money, comes out on Friday. A near-surefire of figuring out where markets are heading is to make a prediction — and disregard it. The S&P 500 may have slipped 0.6% last week, snapping its three-week winning streak. But it's still up almost 27% this year, shattering the 6,000 level for the first time on its journey upward. That's way ahead of forecasts made by top financial strategists at the end of 2023, notes CNBC's Pia Singh. JPMorgan's chief U.S. equity strategist, Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, for instance, expected the broad-based index to close the year at just 4,200. Even the most optimistic prediction — a 5,200 target from John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer — didn't capture the exuberant stock rally this year. And that's why even though market strategists anticipate the S&P to finish 2025 at 6,630, according to the average forecast from the CNBC Market Strategist Survey, investors should take it with a pinch of salt. Granted, there's positive sentiment bubbling among investors, thanks to Trump's high regard for the stock market as a barometer for his presidential tenure, steadily loosening monetary policy, the prospect of lower corporate taxes, among other factors. But, in markets — as in life — the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry. Inflation might make an unwelcome return — like measles and possibly polio in the U.S. — because of Trump's promised tariffs and the tit-for-tat trade wars that could ensue. Indeed, inflation already "looks a little stuck," said Goldman Sachs' vice chairman Robert Kaplan, previously president of the Dallas Fed. Still, despite my skepticism of predictions, I'd love it if Bank of America's Savita Subramanian proves to be a prescient market forecaster. Imagine ending 2025 with the S&P at Subramanian's target of 6,666. — CNBC's Sarah Min, Pia Singh, Sean Conlon and Samantha Subin contributed to this report. Got a confidential news tip?
