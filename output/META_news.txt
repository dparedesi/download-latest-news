ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. In investing, patience is rewarded. Mutual funds can deliver on several investment goals, with capital appreciation being near the top of the list. Growth mutual funds consolidate fast-moving companies into one portfolio, which can yield exciting results. The funds highlighted below cover a range of exposures and include both active and passive management styles. Despite the strategy differences, they align on the objective of delivering above-market returns for their shareholders. This list of growth mutual fund picks includes options targeting a range of exposures, from up-and-coming domestic small caps to foreign multinationals. They additionally meet these criteria: The table below highlights six top growth mutual funds that meet the noted parameters. Reviews of each fund follow. FECGX by the numbers: Fidelity's small cap growth fund tracks the Russell 2000 Growth Index. The index includes Russell 2000 companies that outperform peers on EPS growth and sales per share growth. The average five-year EPS growth for the group is 18.66%, about 50% higher than the 12.29% growth average among broader Russell 2000 companies. Historically, small caps have provided important diversification for stock portfolios. Smaller companies are riskier and more volatile, because they can have less predictable business performance and reduced access to capital. But smaller companies can grow faster than bigger ones, as they did between 2000 and 2012. While large caps have been dominant in recent years, many analysts believe this is a cyclical trend that will reverse itself. A conservative position in small caps prepares you for that reversal. FMDGX by the numbers: The Fidelity Mid Cap Growth Index Fund replicates the performance of the Russell Mid Cap Growth Index. The index isolates the growth-oriented companies of the Russell Mid Cap Index. These fast-movers are identified by high price-to-book ratios, two-year growth outlooks and historic sales per share growth. High-growth mid caps are poised to become the next large caps. Companies to watch in this portfolio include the AI darling Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN). Middle-sized companies are more nimble than large caps and more stable than small caps. They can outpace large companies when the economy is expanding and they hold up better than small companies when the economy is contracting. Mid caps can also offer cheaper valuations than large caps—though Palantir is a notable exception. SWLGX by the numbers: Schwab’s large-cap growth fund invests in the Russell 1000 Growth Index. The index includes growth stocks that are also among the 1,000 largest U.S. companies by market capitalization. In five of the last six years, SWLGX has produced annual returns from 27.53% to 42.66%. 2022 was the exception; a broad technology sell-off in that year pushed SWLGX to a 29.16% decline. SWLGX has more than 50% concentration in the Magnificent Seven stocks: Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG) and Tesla (TSLA). The group earned the name by driving much of the S&P 500 gains in recent years. Given their collective performance, it’s hard not to prioritize them in a growth portfolio. Beyond the Magnificent Seven, SWLGX also includes payment processor Visa (V), pharma stock Eli Lilly (LLY), club store Costco (COST) and Home Depot (HD)—solid performers in their own right. ANWPX by the numbers: The New Perspective Fund invests in stocks that benefit from growing global trade. Portfolio companies are multinationals, each with a significant business presence outside their home country. About 53% of the fund's assets are U.S. equities, 43% is in foreign stocks and the remainder is held in cash. ANWPX is an actively managed fund, meaning the fund managers are making strategic trading decisions—rather than relying on an index to define the portfolio. Active funds can and sometimes do beat the market but they also charge a higher expense ratio than index funds. ANWPX has made the trade-off worthwhile in recent years, outperforming the MSCI All Country World Index and the Morningstar Global Large-Stock Growth category average in the prior 10-year and five-year periods. The portfolio includes many recognizable names in a composition you won't find in an index fund. Top holdings include Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and French eyewear company EssilorLuxottica (ESLOF). VINEX by the numbers: The Vanguard International Explorer Fund invests in smaller growth companies located outside the U.S. The focus is on developed markets in Europe and the Pacific, though emerging markets stocks comprise 7.4% of the assets. The portfolio's median market capitalization is $4 billion, and its earnings growth rate is 14.6%. VINEX provides diversified exposure to foreign small caps—about 350 companies spread across 20 countries. The fund can be volatile, but the portfolio has strongly outperformed U.S. small caps in the last year, returning 12.52% compared to FECGX’s 3.5% return. Due to its volatility, you would hold this fund in a relatively small proportion alongside larger positions in domestic and foreign large caps. VWIGX by the numbers: VWIGX invests in non-U.S. large caps with growth characteristics. Portfolio companies are primarily located in Europe (48.6%), emerging markets (21.1%), the Pacific (17.2%) and North America (12.2%). The fund's median market cap is $90.4 billion and the earnings growth rate is 25.3%. Vanguard’s international large-cap growth fund holds interesting companies that may be too volatile for most investors to hold as individual positions. Examples include ecommerce giant MercadoLibre (MELI), Chinese tech company BYD (BYDDY) and Dutch semiconductor company ASML Holding NV. VWIGX earned a Silver rating from Morningstar in 2025, for excelling in process, performance, people, parent and price. The fund has a long-term focus, but its managers occasionally make opportunistic moves into stocks with trend-driven upside or those with underestimated potential. The fund can be volatile, so most investors will hold it as a diversifier rather than a core position. Bottom Line Growth investing is high risk and high reward. You can mitigate some risk through diversification and long holding periods. The diversification limits your dependence on one company, industry or economy. And long holding periods prevent you from realizing losses created by short-term volatility. In investing, patience is rewarded.

Title: Apple might buy Perplexity AI to bolster AI division
URL: https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/06/23/apple-might-buy-perplexity-ai-to-bolster-ai-division/

Apple is still considering its AI moves, and now it seems like the startup Perplexity might be on the menu. A new report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says that Apple is weighing the pros and cons of an acquisition that could help it acquire more AI talent and products. On the flip side, there are reports that Apple might partner with the company instead of buying it. This partnership could lead to an AI search engine powered by Perplexity and integrating the company’s tech into Siri. The report says Apple has made no formal offers, but has met with the company several times lately. This deal and/or partnership is likely spurred by two things. First is the potential for Apple and Google’s deal for search on iPhone to evaporate as U.S. courts look at Google as a monopoly on the search market. Apple is also seen as behind the competition in AI, and a major move like this is bound to be good for the stock price. The Bloomberg report mentions that Google’s stock fell a point after the news went live about Apple’s possible AI acquisition. There’s also some speculation that Sam Altman and OpenAI’s deal with ex-Apple design legend Jony Ive on some AI hardware might be putting pressure on Apple to get into the AI game sooner rather than later. That being said, Apple is working on its own AI tools, so it’s likely a matter of how long it thinks those will take to make and how much the company actually cares about what Wall Street thinks. There is an argument to be made that with Apple’s dominant market share in the iPhone, it can likely afford to be a few years late to the AI game, especially since we’ve seen so many issues with the current crop of generative and search AI tools. However, previous reports said Apple’s top executives are split on AI adoption, so things might be stalling in either direction. The report also mentions that Meta has already made an offer to buy Perplexity, but the companies couldn’t come to an agreement, so Meta invested in Scale AI. Perplexity’s CEO says that Meta even tried to poach them for its ‘Superintelligence’ team. Meta has also approached staff from OpenAI and offered salaries with $100 million signing bonuses. Meta’s investment in Scale was US$14.3 billion, (C$19.6 billion), so it stands to reason that the company offered a similar deal to Perplexity. The AI startup is valued at US$14 billion (C$19 billion) after its last funding round, so I expect it will cost even more if Apple wants to buy the company. The big question I have at this point is, if Apple is considering making big AI moves, will that delay some of the already announced features, like the Siri enhancements we’ve been waiting for since WWDC in 2024?

Title: Coffee Break: Nihilists at Google Wrecking Existing Business to Chase AI Growth
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/?p=294347
Time Published: 2025-06-23T18:00:03Z
Full Content:
In 2016 Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced that “in the long run, we’re evolving in computing from a ‘mobile-first’ to an ‘AI-first’ world.” In 2018, he famously told Kara Swisher that AI is “one of the most important things that humanity is working on. It’s more profound than, I don’t know, electricity or fire.” It’s generally over-looked that he opened that statement by saying “We don’t take a very optimistic view of AI” and closed by responding to Swisher’s comment that “fire is pretty good” with “(fire) kills people too, we have learned to harness fire for the benefits of humanity but we have to overcome its downsides too.” And yet, just over four years later Pichai, by then also CEO of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, issued a ‘code red’ and directed multiple department heads including those in charge of research, trust, and safety “to switch gears to assist in the development and launch of AI prototypes and products.” This directional switch took place only three weeks after the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT product. At the time, The New York Times warned that “because these new chat bots learn their skills by analyzing huge amounts of data posted to the internet, they have a way of blending fiction with fact” and “that could turn people against Google and damage the corporate brand it has spent decades building.” The Times also quoted University of Washington professor Margaret O’Mara saying, “For companies that have become extraordinarily successful doing one market-defining thing, it is hard to have a second act with something entirely different.” That was in late 2022, as of mid-year 2025, it is clear that Pichai has damaged Google’s brand and its core search product in a seemingly competition with OpenAI. As I tried to understand what Pichai was doing, my initial framework was Cory Doctorow’s “enshittification” concept defined as when “vendors create high-quality offerings to attract users, then they degrade those offerings to better serve business customers, and finally degrade their services to users and business customers to maximize profits for shareholders.” Over the past year I’ve found Ed Zitron’s analysis of Google’s decision-making has deepened my understanding of WTF Pichai is up to. I’ll come back to Zitron in a moment, but for those new to his work, I’d recommend giving these three pieces a quick skim: I’ve also found pioneering AI researcher Gary Marcus’ work very useful — he flagged most of the limitations of LLM AI decades ago and has been consistently vindicated in his skepticism that the current OpenAI and Alphabet approach to AI will truly prove “as important as fire.” We’ll come back to Marcus too. But first I want to touch on an idea that Naked Capitalism readers have seen recently in another context via Curro Jimenez: nihilism. Curro was quoting the French sociologist Emmanuel Todd’s analysis of Israel’s recent behavior in Gaza and Iran and this quote jumped out at me: “Perhaps in the unconscious depths of the Israeli psyche, being Israeli today is no longer about being Jewish — it’s about fighting the Arabs.” I would argue that for Pichai and those remaining at Google under his leadership, being Google today is no longer about being the dominant search engine — it’s about fighting OpenAi/ChatGPT. On Wednesday, I’ll be applying Todd’s formulation to the current leadership of the Democratic party which is no longer about being the party of the working class but rather it’s about fighting off the progressive wing of the party. Now, let’s dive into Ed Zitron’s explanation of why Google is willing to risk its incredibly lucrative core search business and maybe even destroy the open web itself in a quest to compete with Open AI. Zitron is an effective polemicist so let’s let him cook a little: Google no longer provides the “best” result or answer to your query – it provides the answer that it believes is most beneficial or profitable to Google. Google Search provides a “free” service, but the cost is a source of information corrupted by a profit-seeking entity looking to manipulate you into giving money to the profit-seeking entities that pay them. The net result is a product that completely sucks. …That’s because Google has, like every major tech company, focused entirely on what will make revenues increase, even if the cost of doing so is destroying its entire legacy. Google has announced their own “Bard AI” to compete with Bing’s ChatGPT integration, and I’ll be honest – I feel a little crazy that nobody is saying the truth, which is that Google broke the product that made them famous and is now productizing fixing their own problem as innovation. … Venture capital and the public markets don’t actually reward or respect “good” businesses or “good” CEOs – they reward people that can steer the kind of growth that raises the value of an asset. …Sundar Pichai isn’t paid $280 million a year because he’s a “good CEO.” After all, Google has all but destroyed its search product. He’s paid because he finds ways to increase the overall growth of the company (even while their cloud division still loses money), and thus the stock goes up. Zitron expanded on these ideas in his “Business Idiot” piece: Our economy is run by people that don’t participate in it and our tech companies are directed by people that don’t experience the problems they allege to solve for their customers, as the modern executive is no longer a person with demands or responsibilities beyond their allegiance to shareholder value. The incentives behind effectively everything we do have been broken by decades of neoliberal thinking, where the idea of a company — an entity created to do a thing in exchange for money —has been drained of all meaning beyond the continued domination and extraction of everything around it, focusing heavily on short-term gains and growth at all costs. In doing so, the definition of a “good business” has changed from one that makes good products at a fair price to a sustainable and loyal market, to one that can display the most stock price growth from quarter to quarter. Ewan Morrison elegantly summarized why Pinchai’s commitment to AI is so riskly to its search business and the Open Web itself: One drop of sewage in a glass of water turns the entire glass into sewage.This is happening with AI hallucinated facts on the internet. AI systems have 48% error margins & are turning our historical, news, philosophical & scientific info on the net into sewage.Do not drink it. pic.twitter.com/nN0dhV9Dg2 — Ewan Morrison (@MrEwanMorrison) June 19, 2025 And like Captain Ahab, Pinchai knows he must have a crew just as dedicated to his suicidal mission as he is. He might not be nailing a gold coin to the mast and demanding loyalty oaths, but he is aggressively pushing buy-out offers on Googlers who are not down with the program: Remember Google is offering buyouts to employees who aren’t all-in on how the company is doing things and it’s “AI first” direction. Sadly, I have to think that still working for Google at this point means they support what’s happened and how the company intends to become an an answer engine. — Katherine Argent (@effthealgorithm) June 21, 2025 Let me wrap with a couple of paragraphs from Freddie de Boer about the issues the whole of tech faces and why it thinks AI is the answer: the hype is a phenomenon driven by needs that are fundamentally financial in origin. The tech companies need a new suite of products that can restore their eroding profitability and inspire the public the way that the public was inspired in the late 2000s and early 2010s; the financial sector and investors need the tech companies to be the unicorn stocks that they once were. As usual with speculative capitalism, the tail is wagging the dog. When hockey stick growth does not emerge naturally from reality, it will be invented. Media hype about AI, the almost literal absence of any countervailing narrative, the relentless way that the stodgiest publications inflate the threats/hopes that have been invested in these technologies… it’s all downstream of the desire to feel about tech the way people did in the Obama era and the demand from the moneyed to have the right lottery tickets to buy. A lot of people who are used to getting what they want are looking to let the good times roll again, and “AI” is precisely the kind of vague instrument into which they can throw those hopes. Anyone who points out that the emperor has no clothes is simply told that they don’t understand the technology, and every year that goes by that human life is not seriously disrupted by this technology is just a minor delay. Rinse and repeat. In future posts, I’ll look at other players in the AI space — OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple. Veteran political operative and corporate media professional. Tech billionaires have debunked the myth that private companies produce the best products. They charge the highest prices for the lowest quality products. The solution is clear: nationalize search engines and AI. Hey, it worked for Larry Ellison / Oracle. Everyone else is just following in his footsteps. Some would point to IBM as the original innovator in this space. The rot goes way back. You can nationalize the industry, or the industry can privatize the government. As things stand, the top echelons of the tech giants see their interests largely aligned with the ideologues and bureaucrats and power-seekers in the state apparatus. A new trend is top dudes at Palantir and other companies joining the army (and immediately being promoted to Lt. Col.). It goes both ways. Privatizing will work until it doesn’t. Expect catabolic disruption in the coming year as capabilities get converted to cash leaving nonfunctional systems, not obviously reparable. Mariana Mazzucato in ‘The Entrepreneurial State” discusses the contribution of state funded, mostly university based, R&D, including blue sky research, and covers the big Pharma low risk predisposition. She uses the i-phone case study, as GPS, touch screens and other essential component technologies were all state funded. However, she doesn’t evaluate state directed research against resource consumption, so any comprehensive systems analysis. The values applied often involve military uses, such as through DARPA, but sustainability or social usefulness is more spinoff than deliberate. In the 250 years since the Industrial Revolution we don’t seem to have learned that purely profit oriented development is often damaging both to society and environment. The US definitely has an issue with short-term thinking, and that influences how the gov’t and companies interact with AI, but there’s a lot more going on. Russian President Putin said he was treating AI as on par with nukes in strategic importance. The capacity for AI-enabled weapons to transform war means those who don’t have it are severe underdogs. And while there’s a lot of “ai slop” there is a lot of genuinely impressive capability that is consistently improving, even with occasional bad updates, enshittification, short-term incentives, and so on. Self driving cars are a real thing, esp in China. Autonomous drone swarms that self-select their targets are real. AI isn’t going away, and it will only get better (at least for the paying customers, if not for consumers of “free” services who are actually the ‘product’). Just because US companies are structurally stupid (because the owners enforce short term thinking on executives) doesn’t mean AI is not a game changer. Fundamentally, what is google? A search engine! what does a search engine do? It connects people with the information or resources they seek. That is what Chatgpt does, but in a much more engaging direct way (at least by many users’ standards). To get the ‘answer’ directly instead of sifting through industry technical standards, endless usenet forums, news website archives, or whatever data source – that’s a big shift, and clearly it’s possible even if now it’s not yet super reliable. That’s why one of Google’s top execs recently said something like “we will go bankrupt before we lose the AI race”. Their search was already degrading years ago and financially they were doing just fine. But this LLM chat-interface really could eat their lunch, and they see that. It sounds like they don’t know how to preserve their ad biz just yet, but they know they need to be at the forefront of this new tech and rebuilding their revenue streams to incorporate it, not hold on to an old model that just won’t be as competitive. There’re are a lot of reasons to be upset with Google, but their embrace of LLM-based interactions at the search page backed by their traditional search engine seems smart to me. Separate from the chat interface is LLMs’ reasoning capability, or ability to connect disparate data points in meaningful ways. That will transform search. Google would be foolish not to go head first into this and get the best people and capabilities early on. Don’t get me wrong, I think AI is a disaster for humanity and it’s already having lots of terrible impacts, as NC had documented. But I think ragging on Google for trying to jump on this new tech is not acknowledging the situation they’re in, or the likely future abilities of the tech. Google search sucks because they refused to filter out the spam, because the spam was what brought in the revenue. However: It connects people with the information or resources they seek. That is what Chatgpt does, but in a much more engaging direct way (at least by many users’ standards). To get the ‘answer’ directly The ‘answer’, right or wrong, with no way to evaluate it’s veracity. At least you were honest enough to put it in quotes. If this is the direction society is going, we’re doomed. The FDA evaluating drug safety on what AI halucinates from the swamp of anti-vax drek? EPA deciding pollution rules based on the weight of anti-regulation spam out there? Building codes revised to reflect opinion pieces by developers and material vendors? Because that’s all that AI is – it’s running a popularity contest to see what the most probable ‘answer’ is for any input. That results (for now) seem reasonable is just because the spam hasn’t had a chance to overwhelm the valid, human generated content. Just wait. Completely agree. The ‘answer’, right or wrong, with no way to evaluate it’s veracity. I don’t use Chrome or Google search, but this makes me appreciate Brave browser’s Leo AI in search, which at least cites each website as the source(s) for each detail in its “answer,” and gives links to each cited website below that “answer,” making it easy to click through to verify. But yeah, as we all seem to agree, AI ain’t a thing to celebrate. Sorry, you are kidding yourself. AI had been caught out repeatedly fabricating sources You cannot trust its sourcing. DO NOT USE AI for research, FFS. It isn’t even OK for transcriptions, as IM Doc has reported long form. That’s not true, it’s quite possible to verify a LLM response’s veracity. At the end of your query, add a clause to give citations. I never make a query without doing this. And then I always check the links, as I would with wikipedia. Essentially I just use it to point me to the original source material. It’s been helpful a number of times. This also helps me keep tabs on how often the AI makes shit up, and when. Ha ha. And how many people know to do this? 0.00..01%? Or bother? But they’ll act on the ‘answer’ nonetheless. And what makes you think the citations aren’t hallucinations? And what makes you confident Google et al won’t conveniently change their query processing to ignore your clause, as they’ve done with boolean operators, “exact” match clauses and uncountable other changes they’ve snuck in on the sly? But you do you. Self driving cars are a real thing, esp in China. Autonomous drone swarms that self-select their targets are real. These examples are based on pattern matching, which is something that certain AI technologies can do pretty well. Don’t confuse these with llvm applications, which try to find the the most probable series of human authored tokens in their training data to correspond to a prompt. I don’t anticipate anything good or useful coming out of llvm, partly because of its high error rate, and partly because of its tendency to corrupt future training data. LLMs have no reasoning capability. Agreed. This whole phrase is utter nonsense: “LLMs’ reasoning capability, or ability to connect disparate data points in meaningful ways” I don’t buy it. There are many kinds of reasoning. Some kinds AI is terrible at, and some it’s very impressive at. People’s definition of “reasoning” is changing dramatically, as AI is proving more and more capable. Obviously there are huge reasoning gaps, but they’re shrinking, and much of the pattern matching is simply good enough for many applications if used carefully. Look at geo-guessr. A huge amount of deductive reasoning goes into deciding on a location from clues in the picture. I also know two people who got better medical advice from chatGPT than actual doctors, for non-trivial problems, and in one person’s case it’s been a helpful ongoing consultant. Again, I’m no fanboy and mostly avoid AI and LLMs especially. And I’m very willing to ack the drawbacks and negative influences on society which are copious. But let’s acknowledge the capabilities that are there. No, your assumption is false. First, AI does not and never reasons. Saying it does is a massive category error. Second, LLMs will never never never have enough source material on which to train. So they train on other LLM generated material. That generates more errors over time. It’s a multiplying “garbage in, garbage out” problem. Narrow AI (like reading certain types of images) may perform well, but not the ones you encounter most often, the LLM. There are many articles like this if you would listen to something other than the hype: LLMs are getting dumber and we have no idea why https://www.ignorance.ai/p/llms-are-getting-dumber-and-we-have AI Hallucinations Are Getting Worse. What Can We Do About It? https://builtin.com/articles/ai-hallucinations-worsening-solutions Newer LLM models are getting worse https://www.linkedin.com/posts/richardselfllm_this-is-interesting-the-newer-llm-models-activity-7330013445070741505-_6cj I’ll circle back to ChatGPT and the fundamental reason it is not going to replace Google search. Ed Zitron has demonstrated beyond a doubt that it is not financially viable, not at the free level, not at the premium level. Their last best hope seems to be a turn toward surveillance tech but they’re going up against Palantir and multiple incumbents there. Google’s P/E is down to 18, so lower and more normal compared to the rest of the tech sector (Apple, Microsoft and NVIDIA are all around 30-40, Meta is 25). So investors are increasingly valuing the stock based on actual revenue, not some nebulous growth potential. AI race is all about restoring the perception of these tech stock as having growth potential and pushing the P/E ratios back up without creating actual revenue. Short-term game because you can only maintain the illusion for so long, but enough to create substantial stock price growth for Pinchai and his buddies to collect their bonuses and cash out. Computer sub-literate here, so it’s a given that my opinion/analysis transacts at a very high discount, but I still have to rhetorically ask: if AI is being trained on an ever-increasing mass of Internet data, ever more of which is trash/increasingly enshittified, then isn’t it inherently entropic? We know too well the quality of it most Internet content, and I assume it exceeds the amount of pre-digital knowledge/information daily if not hourly. As humans become ever-more passive and stupefied by tech, why is AI not doomed to become the equivalent of a fiftieth-generation photocopy, or Gresham’s Law applied to information science? See, it doesn’t take an engineering degree to see the basic fallacy at play! You are entirely correct. Your intuition is correct and has already been confirmed scientifically. Not that those mega-corporations care much about it… Maybe AI will kill these corporations and their leaders if this is to be believed: https://www.newsweek.com/ai-kill-humans-avoid-shut-down-report-2088929 Yes. Essentially it is exactly what it says it is, a Probability engine based on a Large Language Model database that includes all inputs stored in that database, good or bad, scientifically valid and invalid, copyright protected or not. And now I will break for lunch… hopefully the wood glue has kept the cheese from sliding off my pizza and onto the broiler floor. Another illustration of this was the Facebook experiment (in 2017 I think) where they had two AI chatbots talk/negotiate with each other. They ended up both speaking in gibberish (which was framed as ‘inventing their own language’) before being shut down. In hindsight, it was a good example of a closed AI loop with no human input eventually becoming unstable. Both of them were operating on content completely different from their training set, resulting in unpredictable and degenerate output, which then fed back into the input and contributed further to the problem. Thank you for this post. I find much of what Ed Zitron has to say, e.g., on tech companies and their CEOs in general, fairly perceptive. He identifies the fundamental problem of scaling in gen AI (similar to that which Yves has identified for blockchain), in his post There Is No AI Revolution: Putting aside the hype and bluster, OpenAI — as with all generative AI model developers — loses money on every single prompt and output. Its products do not scale like traditional software, in that the more users it gets, the more expensive its services are to run because its models are so compute-intensive. And later, The only product that OpenAI has succeeded in scaling to the mass market is the free version of ChatGPT, which loses the company money with every prompt. This scale isn’t a result of any kind of product-market fit. It’s entirely media-driven, with reporters making “ChatGPT” synonymous with “artificial intelligence.” my pleasure as always to post for this wonderful community. And yes, Zitron and Gary Marcus are my go-tos on AI scepticism. Zitron on the business side and Marcus on the tech fundamentals. We are in the midst of the biggest Ponzi scheme in human history. “still working at Google at this point” might also mean that most workers, even highly paid tech workers, are still workers that rely on a paycheck and have to make choices in life in regards to what kinds of principals you can eat and what kind you cannot eat. Oh, what a world where we could all say fock you to the American capitalist elite and just quit this exploitative system en mass. I occasionally use AI to to double check that I have covered most or all of the relevant bases of subjects I once knew well but I haven’t looked at for some stretch of time. It’s truly amazing how much BS hallucination gets injected as fact, which someone with even a rusty degree of subject matter expertise might easily catch, but think of the poor souls who used AI to breeze through their education or training, and who haven’t developed the critical eye to help them distinguish actual fact from AI fact. AI is the super-highway to Idiocracy. Excellent post and comments. For my part I did a Google search on Ahab’s gold coin because high school was long ago and I wanted a refresher. The Wikipedia article on the Moby Dick coin is pretty good, but I wanted to go a bit deeper. That led me to using ChatGPT with the following transcript: https://chatgpt.com/share/6859bdda-f50c-8004-940c-f7a995af0e2d showing it’s not just math errors you have to watch out for. I just find it remarkable that this glib AI pretends to know so much, spins unsupported theories, asserts easily discovered falsehoods, and is obsequious but not regretful when confronted. Reminds me of certain annoying people from high school. Back then people would have blamed the parents, which seems even more justified here and now. Just when you do a Google search these days you get the AI answer at the top of the results. Sometimes they give good leads but that is what the original search page did. But often it totally misunderstands the query and gives information of something completely different and is akin to asking a stranger a question who makes up an answer rather than admit that they do not know or are guessing at the answer. We have been finding that the first pages of “results” from our Google searches are now all infotainment and commercial ads disguised as “information.” Earlier years of Google search showed how good results can be provided to the questioner. This proves that the system can be designed to function for the searcher’s benefit. Today’s Google search is proof that the “service’s” core function has been deliberately degraded to rent seeking behaviour. Stay safe…information now available for a small fee from Google! thank you for the kind words and the analysis of AI’s summary of Ahab’s speech. Oh the lulz. Sometimes it pays to be old. I need to find a new copy to replace my long lost copy from 1976 and re-read Computer Power and Human Reason. Joseph Weizenbaum was right when I was the youngest guy in the lab and he is still right when I am the oldest guy in the lab. The noise-to-signal ratio is a lot higher now, though. YMMV but I seem to have found that presearch.com works fairly well. Almost 60 years ago, a text by Mortimer Taube has been published that anticipates much of nowadays discussions about AI: “Computers and Common Sense – the Myth of Thinking Machines”. Still holds. Interesting article, Nat, and it’s great to see these topics covered on NC. I think I disagree with some of the reasoning behind Google’s pivot to AI. It’s not wrong to say the Google search sucks and Google’s prioritization of their ad revenue has made their core product worse. This also comes at a time when Google has to share more and more of its ad market with competitors. No, I think this pivot to AI is a part of a strategic shift for Google. Cloud hosting is much harder for competitors to break into due to the amount of physical investment, and its customer base is much less fickle than ad firms. If consumer markets tank (as I’m sure they will, soon), cloud hosting will still be immensely important for most institutions, governments, and militaries. Sure, firms everywhere are planning on replacing their workers with ChatGPT, which almost definitely will not work, but many in the military are salivating over the potential AI can play in streamlining intelligence gathering, targeting, and offloading the liability of killing. Breaking into military contracting is no easy task, as the majority of this sector has been monopolised by Raytheon and the like for decades now. With Google’s cloud offerings like Project Nimbus, the Israelis are allowing the IDF to easily build and host AI systems to conduct their genocide; they have the perfect testing ground for future product offerings to both the US military and beyond. Big, billion-dollar contracts in a sector where there will only be a few competitors (Amazon, Microsoft, and to a lesser extent, Oracle) sound a whole lot better than trying to save a faltering product like Google search when it’d be too little, too late. thank you NM. It’s entirely possible you’re correct. Google execs just have to be smarter than I’m giving them credit for or its the biggest deliberate destruction of shareholder capital in my lifetime. Amazon, Oracle and MSFT are definitely using AI to make cloudside plays but I don’t see Google cracking the top 3. However I think there remains a multi-trillion dollar opportunity in delivering high quality search — you know, the kind Google had up to about 2015 or so. It may be a situation where we are both correct to an extent. Don’t forget that Alphabet also owns DeepMind, which I would argue is one of the largest AI companies (that has certainly been overshadowed by others like OpenAI recently). In the Project Nimbus contract (the deal between the Israeli state and AWS and Google Cloud to build 6 “soverign” data centres), Israel stated specifically that they chose Google and AWS over Microsoft and Oracle because of their increased AI capabilities. I did a factual Google search yesterday, with its now automatic AI synopsis, but more in hope than expectation. This was for the full line-up of a one day rock festival I attended in London on May 7th 1972 which gig included both top British and American acts. It was a sellout, with 10,000 there. Yet, apart from one headliner, there is no accurate information – no-one seems to have documented this one-off. Most bands have their own (often obsessive) biographers with tours and gig lists. Most classic venues have their own proud historians. Details often even go as far as set lists, timings, and band members. Google AI then invented a line-up, including merging rock bands and acts who were not there but who performed at other 1972 UK rock festivals, (Reading is 50m away from London) and even adding in from tours in different years. The AI account was totally fictional, hopefully not in a deliberate Orwellian disinformation mode, but with an exceptionally high “Garbage In, Garbage Out” quotient. How harmful can AI be when it is incredible, and with such a low level of accuracy ? This level of factual precision, masquerading as being both an ‘intelligent’ and reliable response, is positively harmful, if there is any genuine expectation of believability. It was as fake as a White House briefing. I’ll suggest that there is a threshold, say the Leavitt threshold of truth, against which current and future AI is measured. The question then arises as to whether any real world decision making ought ever to be left to AI generated material, when even a simple rock concert lineup ends up as distorted as a hall of mirrors. For all I love about NC, this is one of the most insightful comment threads I’ve ever witnessed. As a reader of NC for over 20 years I am truly humble to have posted the post that triggered this conversation. GOOGL doesn’t want to get lapped by a new technology. See companies like Kodak and Blockbuster that failed to adapt. This is more like Kodak choosing to abandon film for disappearing ink technology than any kind of film vs digital ink debate.

Title: Hinge CEO Justin McLeod says dating AI chatbots is ‘playing with fire’

The head of Hinge on AI, monetization, and the future of online dating. The head of Hinge on AI, monetization, and the future of online dating. Today, I’m talking with Hinge founder and CEO Justin McLeod. Hinge is one of the biggest dating apps in the United States — it’s rivaled only by Tinder, and both are owned by the massive conglomerate Match Group, which has consolidated a huge chunk of the online dating ecosystem. A fair warning here: I’ve never actually used a dating app — the algorithm that matched my wife and me was the university housing lottery, which put us in adjacent dorm rooms in the fall of 2000. And my wife is now a divorce lawyer, so playing around with these apps seems a little bit risky. So I always end up approaching conversations about dating apps a little bit removed. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! I asked Justin what it’s like to be the married CEO of a dating app company who doesn’t use his own product anymore, especially as his own personal romantic journey is very intertwined with Hinge. The entire idea of the company and how it has evolved over the years connects to Justin’s own life and his decision to reconnect with his college girlfriend, just a month before she was supposed to marry someone else. The story is so unbelievable that it was turned into an episode of Netflix’s Modern Love. You’ll hear Justin explain how that experience connects to the company’s values, culture, and his vision of what Hinge is really for — and how all of that is geared toward helping people find lasting connections. Hinge bills itself as the app that’s “designed to be deleted,” and that, of course, is in deep tension with how mobile apps and services grow users and revenue. Then there is the AI of it all. Hinge, as part of Match Group, is using AI both internally and within its product, just as Tinder and other competitors are. There’s AI coaching features to help you improve your profile, pick better photos, and even catch an inappropriate message before it gets sent. But pull the string on all these ideas, and you get to a place where people might be talking to AI all the time, even falling in love with it, or having AI agents dating each other before meeting in person. Justin had some pretty strong feelings about the importance of centering real human connection and encouraging people to put their phones down and go out on dates in the real world. Justin also called the idea of AI companionship “playing with fire” and compares those relationships to junk food. There’s a lot more in this conversation. We got on the topic of the Trump administration and how seriously Hinge takes the privacy of its users’ data during an unprecedented crackdown on LGBTQ+ rights. We talked briefly about Apple and its App Store restrictions, now that companies like Epic Games and Match Group are free to send people to the web to process in-app purchases. Hinge has some plans that you’ll hear Justin get into near the end. There’s a lot going on in this one; you might even fall in love. Okay: Hinge CEO Justin McLeod. Here we go. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Justin McLeod, you’re the founder and CEO of Hinge. Welcome to Decoder. Thanks for having me. I’m excited to talk to you. I’ve got to tell you, this is one where I feel like Jane Goodall or a sociologist of some kind. I’m old. I’m married to a divorce lawyer. I can’t even download this app. It’s too risky. I’m watching through the looking glass here. I asked my younger staff for their Hinge feature requests. Don’t worry, I’ve got a million of those. Great. Excited to hear those. When TaskRabbit comes on Decoder, I’m like, “I booked a TaskRabbit.” This is very different. When was the last time you actually used Hinge as a user? Over a decade ago. Wow. Yeah. What’s that like? What’s it like trying to run this team? Is it all just data driven for you, because there’s a real element of dogfooding here. Yes, definitely. We have a lot of single people on our team at Hinge, so there’s a lot of internal dogfooding for sure, and a lot of opinions. I think that the relationship is different. So, I started the company in 2011, and I was single at the time, and I was single for the first four years of Hinge, and then, long story: I got back together with my college girlfriend, and we’ve been together for the last 10 years, married with kids and all. Did you get back together on Hinge? We were together. I tried to get her back. She said no. I started Hinge in response to that. And then someone whom I met on Hinge inspired me to go back. She was about to get married to someone else. She was living in Switzerland. I flew over a month before the wedding. She called off her wedding and moved back to New York, which led to the whole reboot of Hinge. The whole story is very interconnected. I feel like I should throw out my questions. We should just do an episode of Call Her Daddy or something like that. That sounds very complicated. Yeah, it’s been a ride. An incredible ride, and very intertwined with Hinge. But back to your question, I think that we can overweight our own personal experience a bit, especially as the CEO of the company. What I found over time is that people have a wide array of very diverse experiences, and to some extent, I think it actually helps that I’m not in there overweighting my own niche feature requests that would matter to me but not to the whole population. So the app has evolved. It’s more about helping others than it is about helping myself, which was probably the original idea of Hinge. How do you think about the connection between what the data is telling you, the data about what Gen Z daters are doing versus millennial daters, which is the cohort you started with, versus the very emotional experiences people have on this platform, which are out of your control? Eventually, you’ve got to take the meat sack to the bar and look at the other person and not fuck it up, right? Hinge can’t solve that problem, but that’s the heart of the whole enterprise. How do you connect those two in your brain? This is a very complex, nuanced industry. I think sometimes people look at their Hinge feed and they’re like, “Why doesn’t this understand my taste as well as my TikTok feed does?” People don’t quite understand that people aren’t products; they’re not infinite copies of everyone.They don’t always behave the same. Your videos on TikTok don’t have to like you back. There’s just a lot of nuance to getting this right. And you’re right. A fair amount of this comes down to the people on the platform. So what we’re trying to do is to [not only] build a great product but also an environment and a community where people are encouraged to be intentional and authentic, and attract users who are looking to find their person. So that’s definitely the art and the nuance of trying to build a dating app like ours. One of my big criticisms of social media apps right now in 2025 is they’ve all become marketing platforms in some way. At the end of the rainbow, Mr. Beast is trying to sell you an energy bar. That’s what they’re for. And smaller creators are trying to get their first-brand deals or whatever. But there’s a real organization around just marketing. And the platforms try to encourage people to create content for a whole number of reasons, but their reason for being is advertising spend, and then a lot of the content creation on the platform happens for marketing purposes. You can just see how it goes. Hinge and other dating apps are different. You’re trying to incentivize content creation. You’re trying to get people to talk about themselves, to talk to each other. The goal is to market yourself. How do you divorce that from the actual thing you’re trying to do, which is to have people fall in love and get into stable relationships? Well, it’s very much about what you’re optimizing for. And you’re right; social media is ultimately optimizing for engagement, retention, and time in app. That is the lifeblood of any of these companies. How long can they keep you sucked in? That is their objective, and so everything is built around that. And we’ve seen what the consequences of that are. They’re pretty dire. I think Hinge is almost the polar opposite of that. We’re trying to get you to spend less time on your phone and more time out in real life on dates. It’s interesting. When I started Hinge back in 2011, as venture capitalists looked at our business they asked those questions around engagement and retention. They were looking at social media, and they’re like, “What’s your daily over monthly? How much time are people spending in the app? How many sessions per day?” We were optimizing for those things, because that’s what VCs were asking about. That’s how we were raising money. Then Hinge did a pretty big pivot in 2015, when I let go of half the company and we rebooted from scratch, because we felt as if we’d really lost our way. We’d become more of a piece of entertainment that was just about getting people more matches and more activity, and getting them back every day. We’d lost sight of what we were trying to do, which was to have people come to us to find a relationship. We weren’t really optimized around that anymore. When we did that pivot in 2015, the biggest change we made was to stop focusing on the competition. We started focusing on the customer, and we made our North Star metric actual great dates. We introduced the “We Met” survey, where we asked people we suspected had gone on a date if they did in fact go on that date and whether it was good. Everything became oriented toward optimizing for that. That ended up creating a very, very different experience. That actually became the primary differentiator of Hinge. A lot of the other apps in the industry were based on engagement and retention and just getting people back; they were more like entertainment platforms. Hinge became a utility. We started growing through word of mouth, and today we’re the fastest-growing, and in fact the only growing, major dating app. We grew 40 percent last year, while other dating apps are shrinking, because we built a very sustainable business model that delivers on value. The lifeblood of our company is getting more users out on dates, so they tell their friends and then their friends come and join Hinge. The interesting thing about that business model is it’s in the tagline of the company. I always laugh when you all put out a press release, because it says, “Hinge, the app designed to be deleted,” and then a little trademark logo follows every time it’s mentioned, which is just very funny. I appreciate that you have to do it, but it just makes me laugh every time. That means you’re trying to graduate users. You’re a utility, you pay until you’re done, and then you’re out. Yeah, precisely. It means you constantly have to find new users. You basically have a different churn problem. How do you think about that life cycle? We think about it in terms of good churn. We want people turning off the app for the right reason. We don’t want people turning off the app because they gave up too early or because they don’t like Hinge. We want people turning off the app because they found someone, ideally on Hinge. What does it mean to find somebody on Hinge? Like you’re married? You’ve gone on three dates? It’s different for different people. When we did the reboot, our core market was definitely 25- to 35-year-olds, and very much people who were, I would say, looking to find their person and get off the app. Now our fastest-growing segment has been 18- to 25-year-olds, and they’re at a different phase in their lives. It was pretty interesting. When we saw that segment starting to grow, it came as almost a surprise to us. I think what attracted these younger daters wasn’t so much a focus on finding a long-term relationship, or a marriage partner today; it was very much about the authenticity and vulnerability and intimacy they found on Hinge, and a moving away from platforms that felt very gamified and flat to something that felt very human and intentional and authentic. So we think about our daters as having a journey mindset. They’re headed in a direction, they’re on a journey of self-exploration. They don’t want to waste their time on bad dates, but they aren’t necessarily looking for their marriage partner today, and that’s totally fine. We’re just looking to help people get off the app and out on great dates, and form intimate connections in real life. But there’s a difference between getting off the app and going on great dates, and then deleting the entire thing, right? Forever, yes. There’s one exit ramp that is very different from another exit ramp. Not to keep comparing it to social media, but again, I feel as if I’m just viewing this from the outside, so it’s all metaphors for me. Mark Zuckerberg is terrified that young audiences will just abandon his core app, or whatever the core social media dynamic is at the time. This is why he bought Instagram. You can read his emails over the course of these trials. He’s like, “There’s another mechanic. I need to buy it before they overtake us.” Zuckerberg keeps going down the line, whether that’s Stories or Reels or whatever the next thing is. You have the same problem, only you don’t get to keep the old users on the old mechanic. You don’t get to run Facebook and buy Instagram. How do you think about reinventing the app for that new, younger cohort that has different dynamics on the internet? We always stay in tune with where the culture’s going. I think it’s just imperative, because, you’re right, we can’t rely on only a legacy user base. So we have to stay on top of culture and where it’s going, and then continually evolve the app accordingly. Right now, a big focus is on AI, and how we can increase the effectiveness of the app in a couple of different dimensions. We’re actually finding, for example, the extent to which coaching has become really, really important right now. Especially during the pandemic, we saw social skills atrophy. People felt less comfortable meeting up with others in real life and interacting. So we’re helping people create their profiles, write their prompts, things like that. Another big thing that came out during the pandemic was more of a focus on voice, and adding voice prompts, which I think is, again, an example of our moving where the culture goes. So we’re always making these kinds of tweaks to continually keep the app fresh. Do you feel the same existential pressure? There’s this idea that some cohort of people will delete the app — the old millennials will be married or tired or whatever it is they’re going to do, and you’ve got to go get a bunch of new Gen Z users or Gen Alpha users, which is frankly terrifying. How do you think about, “Okay, we’ve got to break the old model, because it’s existential for us if we don’t capture the younger user,” or is it more of a gradation? If you look at the relatively brief history of this industry starting in the ‘90s, there’s only been one major disruption moment, which was around 2012. So you had the birth of the industry in the late ‘90s, where you had Match and eHarmony come on the scene, and then they dominated from 1996 to about 2014. It was actually a much smaller niche industry at the time. The users were older, people who felt as if they’d really struggled to find someone in real life. Then you had the mobile dating apps come on because of a few different technologies that started to come online all together — one was mobile, one was the cultural change of everyone having a social media account. Another was data-processing power and moving away from the world of searching for people to a world of a feed of relevant people, one after another. That created a pretty big paradigm shift, where suddenly technology enabled an entirely new type of experience that it was hard for the old incumbents to mirror. They tried to pivot to mobile, but they couldn’t unseat themselves from their way of thinking about the world. It resembles a very classic disruption problem. I think the next opportunity for that kind of disruption is going to be a big technology shift. We haven’t seen that up until very recently. Like with VR, AR, and other technologies like that, I just don’t see those working until they’re deeply adopted by 70 percent to 80 percent of the population, and that’s when I think it will really become something that people start using for dating. AI I think is a very different story, and it’s unclear at this point whether it becomes a disruptive force for the current players or whether it becomes more of an evolution. Obviously, Hinge has a tremendous amount of data we can use to train AI models. We’re seeing huge gains in our ability to match people up more thoughtfully given the tools, and at the same time we could introduce very new paradigms for dating. I want to talk about AI with you, but you mentioned Match, so I think this is a good time to get to the Decoder questions. You’re part of Match Group. You sold to Match Group, and now Match Group owns all of the dating apps minus one, which is a little contentious. It doesn’t own Bumble. There’s a lawsuit. We can set that aside. What’s it like being part of Match Group? When you sold your company, what was that decision like for you? Honestly, at the time we were in a tough position as a company. I’d done the reboot, and we were about a year into that reboot experience, and we had not really cracked the code yet. There were green shoots there that made me believe and made, I would say, the trained eye believe that there was really something there. But VCs just saw that we were popular, and then we tore down our business, and we restarted, and we started to rebuild again. There wasn’t a lot of juice there. So we went with a strategy of recognizing the value of what we were seeing, including massive increases in effectiveness, women coming to the platform in a much higher proportion than on other dating apps. So that was very interesting to Match. And so we received a strategic investment from the company in 2017, and that gave it a path to buy the rest of the company, which it did at the end of 2018. What’s that structure like inside of Match Group now? It’s evolving. There’s a brand-new CEO, Spencer Rascoff, who just started, and I think he’s taking a fresh look at some of that. But up until recently, and still today, the company operates pretty independently. We’re in New York. We pretty much have our own space. We have our own product teams, our own engineering teams, our own marketing teams that operate very independently. We share learnings across the platform. We use shared services like accounting and legal and things like that. But for the most part, the company has its own independent culture, its own independent mission, product road maps, marketing strategies, all of that. You said you shared some central services, like accounting and finance. Is there any product or data that you’re sharing? We certainly share learnings. Especially on things that we don’t really want to compete on, such as safety or monetization or things like that. So there’s certainly that, and there’s sharing for safety purposes. Those are the main ways we share. So if you’re a young and carefree single on Tinder, and you graduate to Hinge, you don’t get to just bring your data along for the ride? [Laughs] No. Again, I’m just looking from the outside. Tinder is interesting. The CEO of Tinder just stepped down. Your new CEO at Match, Spencer, stepped in to run Tinder for a minute. In any normal circumstance, you would be on the attack. If Tinder wasn’t part of the same company as you, this would be a moment to say, “Okay, there’s some strategic weakness over there. We’re going to go get them. We’re going to put the screws on.” Are you allowed to do that inside Match Group? So first of all, I’ll just say that we don’t really think too much about Tinder as Hinge’s competition. We think about Tinder in a very different psychographic mindset. You come to Hinge because you want to really take your time, be intentional, be thoughtful, find your person. Tinder has a much more casual, younger, “anything can happen” mentality. And so that was a very intentional portfolio strategy decision that Match made back when it acquired us. So no, we don’t think about it like that. That’s why I asked about the data and the lifecycle question. There’s a time in your life where you might use Tinder, there’s a time in your life where you might use Hinge. It seems from the overall umbrella company perspective, you want to move that user around your family of apps, but it doesn’t seem as if that’s actually happening at the top level. Yes. From the outside that would make sense. It’s a bit nuanced, because there are very different brand reputations. We like to think of Hinge pretty independently, and I think so do our users. So there’s no pop-up on Tinder that’s like, “Maybe, it’s time to cool it and download Hinge”? There’s not. [Laughs] Okay, feature request for you. What’s your org chart like? How is Hinge structured? That’s also been evolving over time, and we’re still a relatively small company. We have about 350 employees. If I think about the evolution of Hinge growing from one person to the first 100 to 150 people, originally, it was very centrally run. There was tight coordination. A lot of direction came directly from me and my executive team. Then as we started to grow beyond 100 people, I would say a lot of the technology was relatively stable. Like with social, mobile, big data, the question became, “How do we keep optimizing and iterating around this?” We became a pretty decentralized organization, where we had principles around pushing decision-making down to the lowest levels possible, keeping it really on the front lines. We had pretty independent cross-functional product teams that would work on their individual little missions or surfaces. We oscillated back and forth between that. People felt they had a lot of autonomy. That was the main ethos of the company. And then I think with AI over the last couple of years, we felt like, “Whoa, we really need to make a pretty big shift.” Like I said, the risk of disruption is high, with very big opportunities to shift the product experience in a new direction. It now requires pulling decision-making back in toward the center a bit, and giving a much clearer strategic direction to the team, so that we’re all working in concert toward one thing. Because the whole app really has to move together. Different parts of the app have to talk to each other in ways that when we weren’t going through much change, wasn’t as essential. That said, we still have very highly cross-functional product teams where product managers sit with a dedicated designer, researcher, data scientist, and tech lead to attack very mission-oriented problems. You mentioned “surfaces” and “missions.” Are those expressed as just the tabs at the bottom of the app? Is that how they’re broken down, or are they actual user journey missions? That’s what I mean — surfaces versus missions. I think we’ve gone in different directions. There’s never really a clear line of one versus the other. Do you own the Discover tab, where users just discover new people, or is your job to help people find the right person? In that case, you have to think more cohesively about operating across different surfaces or parts of the app. Now we think about our teams operating less as individual surface units and more as part of a cohesive dating-outcomes team, where people feel a bit more flexible moving around to different surfaces. How do you think about assigning product managers to those teams? Because PMs, at least in my experience, are like, “I own this square, and I will mess with this square to make this number go up as much as I can.” But “I can mess with all the squares” is really hard, right? Yes, that’s why we have strong directors at the VP level who oversee an overall mission the way that a head of dating outcomes or a head of growth, who’s coordinating a set of product managers, would. And again, we ask our PMs. Their primary identity is as a dating outcomes PM, not as a discover PM, or a profile PM, or something like that. And while day to day most of their work may focus on the profile and identity work, they see themselves as very much operating as part of this team. That feels like something you evolved to. You’re a relatively young founder. I think you founded the company right out of Harvard Business School. How has your decision-making framework evolved? How do you make decisions? That’s also hugely evolved. Everything I’ve learned, I’ve learned through doing it all the wrong ways first and then eventually getting to the right way. When you’re a founder and you have a small team of 10, 20, or 30 people, you’re just making decisions by the seat of your pants. What feels good? What feels right? You’re just using your own gut. As we started to get toward 100 people or so, what I noticed was I would be making different decisions on different days that weren’t always consistent. They were based on my mood that day or whatever data was in front of me or what I had last read or whatever. I was just finding I was getting pretty inconsistent. So what I started trying to do was to write down my whole management algorithm. I started putting it in a Google Doc, like “Here’s how I make decisions, here’s what I believe is true.” I started publishing that to the whole company, so everyone could just read it. We would be just very transparent about how we made decisions. It was around the time that I think I read Ray Dalio’s book Principles, and got super dialed in on how we make decisions. What are our principles, and what do we believe is true? Then I opened it up so everyone could comment on it. We would have long debates in the comment margins of a Google Doc to consider everything from our product-strategy principles to whether Hinge should have a dress code. Literally anything. It was all just there so that everyone could debate it. We had hundreds of principles, and then as the company got even bigger and we got to 300 or 400 people, it was very hard. One, you just can’t have these endless debates in Google Docs anymore. Also, the principles started to stabilize. There wasn’t as much debate and churn anymore, and then it actually became an exercise in distilling down the most essential things to communicate about our culture. I worked a couple of years ago to write an internal book called How We Do Things, which distilled it all down to four or five principles. For example, what are the most fundamental things to understand about how we make decisions here? And then individual teams and individual projects would then write their own principles that were more specific to what they were doing at any given time. One of our meta principles now is “decide with principles,” meaning that we don’t want decisions getting made based on some random person’s opinion that if tomorrow this person leaves the company and we hire someone else, they’re going to come in with a completely different set of ideas about how to do something. We really try to define our principles first, agree on those principles, and then see how our work maps to them. I’m happy to talk about what the other three principles are if you want, but that’s the framework we use to make decisions now. Yeah, talk about them a little bit. There’s a beautiful website, we’ll link to it. It has storytelling, it’s well done. But tell people what the other three principles are. So the next one is “love the problem.” What I would notice is we would get an inclination around a user problem, which maybe was not even validated 100 percent. Then we’d start getting feature ideas, and we’d get very attached to a feature, and sometimes the feature would drift and not even be solving the original problem. What I found was, if you want to build breakthrough innovative product features and products, you have to spend extra time with the problem to really understand the why behind the why behind the why of of it. You need to ask, “What’s really going on here? Can we really get deep into our users, into the data, into our users’ experiences?” You have to go to that level to get insight that just isn’t available on the surface, and then stay really committed to that problem. And that’s what, again, allows for innovation. I think for a lot of Silicon Valley, the strategy is just to throw feature ideas against a wall and see what sticks: “Let’s see if this works. Oh, it doesn’t work, throw that out, let’s try something else.” When you have a lot of deep conviction around a user problem, and you really know you want to solve it, then you have the resilience to try and try again to solve that problem, even if your first or second iteration doesn’t make it. So one of the most foundational of our principles is, “love the problem.” Fall in love with the problem, don’t fall in love with the solution, as you must be willing to give up the solution at any given time if it’s not solving the core problem that you’re trying to solve. So that is “love the problem.” Next is “keep it simple,” meaning that I think the best solutions are always the most elegant solutions. Overall, we want to keep the product very simplified and minimal. Our colors are black and white. If you look at the Hinge product today, it’s very clean, it’s very simple. We’re always stripping away features that don’t make sense and just recognizing that there’s complexity. There’s a cost to complexity every time you add a feature. So even if you add a feature, if it’s only marginally beneficial, the cost of the complexity and maintaining that feature versus the marginal benefit it adds will end up gunking up the app over time and slowing you down over time. That’s a hard conversation to have with product managers, because they’ll work for months on a feature and they’ll ship it and say, “Yeah, it didn’t harm the user base, we like it, and it even moved this metric over here by 2 percent.” And you’re like, “Well, the cost of complexity is high, and so we need to focus on things that are actually going to have a major impact.” Are you all the way two features out for every feature in? Do you think about it that way? I know some founders do. I haven’t heard that before. I don’t necessarily think that way. But I do believe in constantly reevaluating what’s in the app, asking what needs to stay, and having a high bar for building a new feature. So does it actually accomplish what we need it to accomplish, and is the complexity worth the cost? So that’s the third one now. The fourth, the last one, is “tend to trust.” I just find that trust is the lifeblood of an organization. You have to do a lot of work to proactively cultivate and tend to trust by creating strong interpersonal relationships, by creating lots of opportunities for transparency at the organization. We have always been very, very transparent about where the organization is headed. So much so that we had to make all Hinge employees Match Group insiders so they couldn’t trade Match Group stock except during trading windows, because we would be so transparent about where we were, what our financial position was. Everyone should know that all the way down to any position at the company. I think the trust that you create both interpersonally and from the leadership on down to the rest of the organization is absolutely essential. It just saves you a lot of headaches when it comes to internal politics and all those types of things. Let’s put this into practice. You obviously made a big decision to refocus on AI. How did that come about? Did you wake up one day and say, “Oh boy, it’s happening”? Was it that Match Group put out a press release with OpenAI saying, “We’re going to work together”? Did you read that and say, “I got to figure this out”? How did this come about? Certainly the release of whatever version of ChatGPT that sent shockwaves through the world was a pretty big wake-up call. Obviously, we’d already been using machine learning and things like that in the interest of safety, and in our algorithms, our recommendation algorithms. But I think the shot across the bow that came from the release of ChatGPT [with GPT-3.5] was what really woke us up to the potential capabilities here and to realizing that this could be a major disruptive force in a way that we hadn’t really seen since we started Hinge. It took a bit for us to get our strategy clear about what our thesis was on how this was going to affect matching and dating in the future. It wasn’t immediately apparent, but I think we have a pretty clear thesis now, and we’ve started to organize the company around that thesis. What’s the thesis? That there’s two main vectors that AI is going to impact: dating and matchmaking. I think the big story is AI is going to move Hinge much closer to the experience of working with a personalized matchmaking service, and away from the experience of feeling that you are joining a social platform on your own as you try to find your person. So what does that mean? Two big pieces. One is personalized matching, and the other is effective coaching. On the personalized matching front, we should be able to move much further beyond the world we are in today, which is our users speaking to us in essentially Morse code as they try to communicate to us what they like and what they don’t like. The idea is that they would be able to speak much more directly to us with “here’s what I’m looking for, here are my values, here’s my personality, here are my interests.” It means Hinge being able to listen to them and hear their preferences, and even integrate things like relationship science into the app to better understand what types of people are compatible and what types of people are not long-term compatible, and introduce them to a much more curated, higher-quality, less-quantity list of people, where they have much more trust that if you’re introducing them to this person, this is probably someone they want to go out with. We’ve already seen big gains, by the way, just by using the power of LLMs to drive more of our recommendation systems using the data we already have. But we released a new algorithm a couple of months ago that increased matches and dates by like 15 percent, and that’s just using the same data. But now we can start to use much more of that unstructured, nuanced data, with people talking to us in their own voice about who they are and what they want, which we can use very effectively. So that’s the whole personalized matching front. Then there’s the effective coaching front. A lot of our users struggle to get out on that first date, and they often don’t know why. I have friends who are incredible people, and they’ll ask me to take a look at their Hinge profile. I’m flabbergasted that this is their attempt at putting themselves out there. So we’re starting with pretty basic things. Hinge has these prompts, which are short questions designed to get you into a conversation, and you put them on your profile. A lot of people write great responses to prompts, but a lot of people write not-so-great responses, often just one-word answers that just don’t work. We found it’s just incredibly effective to have trained an AI model on good-prompt responses and give people feedback. And it’s mostly like, “Can you say more about that?” [Laughs] Don’t just put “no.” Yeah, and to be a little bit more specific and tell a little bit of the story. Good answers invite another question back, or get a conversation going. So we can give people those nudges so they write good prompts, so that they choose good photos. We have a team called Hinge Labs, which is always looking at why some people succeed, and why some people don’t on the app. Some of it is, again, simply building product features that help solve those problems, but another part of it is just giving guidance and notes about how they can be using the product better. We have traditionally published those in date reports, and we publish them in the press and we place them in the help center. But for the most part people just don’t read them. But the idea that we can take this body of knowledge we have about how to succeed on Hinge, and then look at how our users are using Hinge, and then deliver the right piece of advice at the right time to the right user, I think is going to be pretty transformative for a lot of people. There’s a pretty fine line between that and what I see lots of people already doing all day long, which is just talking to ChatGPT, just hanging out. We had Eugenia Kuyda, the CEO of Replika, on the show, and she said, essentially, “My plan is people are going to date AI bots that will coach them up into being fully formed people, then we’ll release them into the dating pool, and they will have confidence and self-assuredness.” Again, there’s a fine line between prompting someone and coaching them inside Hinge, and we’re coaching them in a different way within a more self-contained ecosystem. How do you think about that? Would you launch a full-on virtual girlfriend inside Hinge? Certainly not. I have lots of thoughts about this. I think there’s actually quite a clear line between providing a tool that helps people do something or get better at something, and the line where it becomes this thing that is trying to become your friend, trying to mimic emotions, and trying to create an emotional connection with you. That I think is really playing with fire. I think we are already in a crisis of loneliness, and a loneliness epidemic. It’s a complex issue, and it’s baked into our culture, and it goes back to before the internet. But just since 2000, over the past 20 years, the amount of time that people spend together in real life with their friends has dropped by 70 percent for young people. And it’s been almost completely displaced by the time spent staring at screens. As a result, we’ve seen massive increases in mental health issues, and people’s loneliness, anxiety, and depression. I think Mark Zuckerberg was just quoted about this, that most people don’t have enough friends. But he said we’re going to give them AI chatbots. That he believes that AI chatbots can become your friends. I think that’s honestly an extraordinarily reductive view of what a friendship is, that it’s someone there to say all the right things to you at the right moment The most rewarding parts of being in a friendship are being able to be there for someone else, to risk and be vulnerable, to share experiences with other conscious entities. So I think that while it will feel good in the moment, like junk food basically, to have an experience with someone who says all the right things and is available at the right time, it will ultimately, just like junk food, make people feel less healthy and mo re drained over time. It will displace the human relationships that people should be cultivating out in the real world. How do you compete with that? That is the other thing that is happening. It is happening. Whether it’s good or bad. Hinge is offering a harder path. So you say, “We’ve got to get people out on dates.” I honestly wonder about that, based on the younger folks I know who sometimes say, “I just don’t want to leave the house. I would rather just talk to this computer. I have too much social pressure just leaving the house in this way.” That’s what Hinge is promising to do. How do you compete with that? Do you take it head on? Are you marketing that directly? I’m starting to think very much about taking it head on. We want to continue at Hinge to champion human relationships, real human-to-human-in-real-life relationships, because I think they are an essential part of the human experience, and they’re essential to our mental health. It’s not just because I run a dating app and, obviously, it’s important that people continue to meet. It really is a deep, personal mission of mine, and I think it’s absolutely critical that someone is out there championing this. Because it’s always easier to race to the bottom of the brain stem and offer people junk products that maybe sell in the moment but leave them worse off. That’s the entire model that we’ve seen from what happened with social media. I think AI chatbots could frankly be much more dangerous in that respect. So what we can do is to become more and more effective and support people more and more, and make it as easy as possible to do the harder and riskier thing, which is to go out and form real relationships with real people. They can let you down and might not always be there for you, but it is ultimately a much more nourishing and enriching experience for people. We can also champion and raise awareness as much as we can. That’s another reason why I’m here today talking with you, because I think it’s important to put out the counter perspective, that we don’t just reflexively believe that AI chatbots can be your friend, without thinking too deeply about what that really implies and what that really means. We keep going back to junk food, but people had to start waking up to the fact that this was harmful. We had to do a lot of campaigns to educate people that drinking Coca-Cola and eating fast food was detrimental to their health over the long term. And then as people became more aware of that, a whole personal wellness industry started to grow, and now that’s a huge industry, and people spend a lot of time focusing on their diet and nutrition and mental health, and all these other things. I think similarly, social wellness needs to become a category like that. It’s thinking about not just how do I get this junk social experience of social media where I get fed outraged news and celebrity gossip and all that stuff, but how do I start building a sense of social wellness, where I can create an enriching, intimate connection with important people in my life. The connection between the wellness industry and the rise of social media is a whole other podcast, and maybe a PhD thesis, too. There’s a whole lot there to unpack. I take your point though, that maybe using our phones in healthier ways is the future. It will make us better, and that will be a reaction to the negativity we see from phones today. Literally as we speak, I’m sure Elon Musk and Donald Trump are continuing to tweet at each other in an unhealthy way for maybe the future of the entire planet. But you’ve got to use AI today. You have prompt feedback running in the app today. You’re helping people pick better photos. The flip side of that is that they might just use AI to generate the content. Can you detect it if your prompt feedback says, “Hey, that’s not a good answer,” and someone runs away to Gemini or ChatGPT and comes up with a better answer that doesn’t actually reflect them? I think about this like the extreme photo filters, which used to be popular on Instagram back in the day. Ultimately, you are going to have to go meet up with this person on a real date, and so you want to come across as best as you can, because, obviously, you’re not going to bring ChatGPT on your date with you. I’m worried about this. I want to say that I’m worried about this. So it’s not a winning strategy. That said, do people ask for advice and little tweaks? They already do it today. They ask their friends, “How should I respond to this text message?” So in some sense, I don’t see it that differently, because you will have to meet up with this person eventually and show up as the real you. Would you add that feedback inside Hinge? Hinge obviously has messaging features. Are you going to add a little coach into the messaging feature to say, “Hey, don’t be a dick”? That already exists. It’s called “Are You Sure?” That’s AI-driven to make sure people don’t send inappropriate messages. But yeah, again, the right nudge at the right time, because I think if we build the right tools within Hinge that are appropriate for dating, people will then use it and be less likely to run out to ChatGPT and use [the feedback] in ways that are probably less appropriate. Nudging people to say, “Hey, you guys have been chatting for a bit. Did you know that most people, after they exchange this many messages, usually just go on and move to a date?” Or, “Hey, it seems like the conversation has died. Here’s something interesting that you may not have noticed on their profile that you can ask about.” Little things like that, certainly. One of the interesting dynamics here is you’ll add more and more AI to the digital experience people have with each other to make them perform better or act better or be more interesting, whatever it is. And then they’ll go on a date, and then they might leave your platform. They might switch to iMessage or call each other on the phone. I don’t think Gen Z is calling each other. They’ll do something else. They’ll go on Discord. How do you bring that experience along for the ride to say, “We’re going to continue to stay here and help mediate and coach you through this relationship”? We’re not there yet. We still have a lot of work to do just to get people out on the first date. And at the same time, I do think there’s actually a lot of opportunity to help coach people through that experience. How to show up on a first date. What to talk about on a first date. How to build intimacy over time, how to ask about the right things to determine compatibility. So I think there are definitely opportunities for that. It’s not on the 2025 road map, but it’s certainly something I’m thinking about. Do you worry that people are going to just upload full AI avatars on Hinge and catfish each other to death? We have a very robust trust and safety team that is thinking two to three steps ahead about how to mitigate things like that. I have spent too much time talking about watermarks in AI and SynthID, and there’s lots of episodes of the show that are deep in the AI watermarks game, and it has effectively come to nothing so far. There’s just a lot of problems there. Are you able to say, “Okay, we can detect a full AI photo here”? There’s so many signals when it comes to creating a dating profile from the phone number you use and the email you use and your IP address, all those things like that, that we have a very multifaceted way of determining the authenticity of profiles. I’ll say that. Running these models is costly. There’s lots and lots of different kinds of models you can run at different costs. Are you using lots of models? Are you sending everything to GPT-4? How does this work for you? We use different models for different things. Sometimes we build them completely internally. As you said, it’s public that we have a relationship with OpenAI. So we use different things and are always balancing cost and performance against our ability to build in-house versus not. Do you see that trend shifting over time? I’m very curious about what the frontier models can do versus what the cheaper, more efficient models can do. Have you seen that shift over time as you’ve started to deploy these tools? For one, we’ve seen the cost of the frontier models just decline precipitously, which is pretty interesting to watch. But I’ll say that there are models, even the prompt feedback model, that are very, very specific and discrete, and that we can mostly build internally to understand. Do you run that in your cloud and your data center? Or are you running that on people’s phones? I don’t actually know. I think that’s in the cloud. I’m almost positive that one is in the cloud. The reason I’m asking is that to do any of this well, you need more and more data from people, and you’re asking them to generate more and more data. For instance, “That’s not a good answer; tell me more about yourself,” is more data and it’s data that you’re now storing. In particular, it’s data about gender, sexuality, and dating preferences — that’s stuff the government suddenly has a very unusual and somewhat threatening interest in. Are you worried about that? That the Trump administration or some future administration would show up and say, “Tell me all of the transgender people on your platform”? Obviously, we have very, very sensitive data that we have very, very clear protections around. And we haven’t seen anything like that. So you haven’t had any of those incoming requests yet? No. The Trump administration has also said it’s going to start scanning social media profiles for references to Palestine, and for comments about Trump himself. When you talk about matching people and values, those things come up. Has there been any request for Hinge profiles from the Department of Homeland Security or ICE or any of these other parts of the Trump administration that are doing this social media scanning? No. The reason I’m asking is the amount of data you might collect is very, very personal. It seems like a rich target. Have you thought about the planning for how big of a target this might become as you prompt people to input more and more data with AI? Certainly. I think we’ll have to handle those things as they come. We’re obviously in a very uncertain time right now, but I will say that we are primarily a platform about creating intimate one-to-one connections where people should be able to express themselves in the way they see fit, and describe themselves and their own sexuality and their own gender in the way they need to do. That will inevitably touch on people’s very private lives. I view that as absolutely sacred and fundamental to our mission, and people feeling safe to express themselves is absolutely critical. So those would be our very highest priorities, and I imagine not top priority for social media, where people are blasting posts to thousands, or millions, of people. Our platform is not about one-to-many posting and conversation. It’s about intimate one-to-one connection and one-to-one conversations. I think I would warn you that having a data pool of that kind might make you a target. I’m curious how that plays out over time, particularly in this administration. There’s some platform dynamics here as well, like iOS and Android exist. They are platforms. They’re also themselves rich targets for the government. Overall, there’s a push for the platforms to do age verification themselves. There’s laws now in certain states, and in other countries, that the Apples and the Googles of the world have pushed back against in various ways. Do you think they need to do it? Do you think that it’s at the iOS and Android level that you need to do the age verification? Because this is a core component of bringing people onto Hinge. It’s not for children. It’s certainly not. We’re 18-plus and we have our own age verification methods. But yeah, we have been pushing for these platforms to do age verification themselves because they have even more robust ways to do it. The arguments in response — when you listen to Apple and Google push back against these laws — is that it would be too hard. It would create a censorship regime, that the app vendors need to be liable for this. Have you seen any movement in that dynamic? I think at the highest level, this is one of the big dynamics of how we might regulate platforms in the future. I am staying much closer to product development and where we’re going with AI right now than I am to that. Your monetization method is obviously a premium version of Hinge. I think one tier is $55 a month. There’s another tier that’s $45 a month. The big news in the platform world is that Apple is no longer allowed to prevent alternative payment systems. Match Group, in particular, has been leading this fight. It’s in all the press releases. Has that changed the dynamics of Hinge for you? I don’t know if it changes the dynamics, but it’s certainly going to give us more flexibility in giving users options to be able to pay in different ways. I think that’s good for everybody for sure. Have you launched an alternative payment service yet? We have not. Would you like to? Yes. How soon? Certainly by the end of the year. Is that going to be a Match Group payment service or a Hinge payment service? How do you think about that? These are things that we’re figuring out, but most likely Hinge. That would return somewhere on the order of 15 percent to 30 percent depending on how the billing works for you at your scale and recurring subscriptions and all that. Is that just going to be pure margin? You’re just going to get the money back? Well, I think it changes the equation on many fronts. It allows us to invest more in the company. It changes how we would price, so no, I think it could result in lower prices. It could result in more investment in the company, or it could result in more margin. It’s probably some combination of all three of those. Match Group has been doing this fight for a long time, and you’re already describing how you might change pricing or the lifetime value of customers. Fortnite maker Epic Games fought this fight for five years. At the very end, the judge says, “I’m very mad at you, Apple. You can’t do this anymore.” Did you immediately start making plans that day or were you like, “This is going to get appealed, we have to wait”? There’s been back and forth and appeals and stays and things like that. I think just a couple of days ago, the appeal was denied. So I think that made it pretty real. Just to put the decision-making into practice, did you say that day we need an alternative payment system? Certainly the day that the original ruling came out, we started to plan. What does that planning look like? Is it, “I’m going to call Stripe”? Put us in your shoes. That happens. Someone comes to you and you say, “Okay. We need to start to plan.” Walk us through that moment. Just like anything else at Hinge, I think that we stay grounded in our principles. We look at the big picture. We look at the teams and the road maps and the things they’re focused on right now, and we think, “Does this new information change anything? And as we look at our growth team, does it make sense to build the next monetization or expansion feature? Does it make sense to pivot resources over to this thing?” And given, as you said, the 15 percent to 30 percent gain that’s on the table, it’s a pretty high priority. There’s an ecosystem of companies that might be building this stuff more centrally, that might be charging different rates. I’m excited about that. It’s wonky and boring. There’s a reason we’re ending the episode on payment systems. A whole new industry I think will emerge. Well maybe not an industry, but certainly a suite of services will emerge around this to allow people to manage subscription payments, cancellations. It’s certainly nuanced. But at the end of that, what you want is rates to come down. Where do you think the rates should be? I know no one has ever thought they should be at 15 percent or 30 percent. Where do you think they should be with a little more market competition? When you stack the credit card payment processing fees on top of the fees around customer service and all the nuance of managing those, I do think it comes down to the 5 percent to 10 percent range. When you think about recovering that up to 20 percent, are you thinking, “Okay, I can use this to lower prices and grow,” or is it that you have to build many, many more AI features to compete against the coming onslaught of AI chatbots? [Laughs] I think we’re very, very focused on innovating for the future. Like I said, it changes the equation, so it’s on all three fronts. It’s lower prices, it’s higher margin, and it’s more investment in the company. But it certainly gives us major opportunities to invest in the core product experience at a time when there’s massive disruption. So it’s a particularly critical time to be doing that. There’s a lot of talk about platform shifts. You’ve talked about platform shifts here. People might be using Hinge differently, because they have AI tools or because the AI tools are helping them find one another more efficiently, or better. A lot of the platform shift I hear about is, “Oh, we’re going to have new devices. We’re going to have new form factors. People are just going to talk to ChatGPT in the bar.” Maybe we’ll just have agents that represent us, and they’ll go on dates for a while, and come back and say, “You should go on this date with this other person we found on Hinge,” because the agents have fallen in love, and now you just have to not screw it up. That takes the screen away. That takes your surfaces and your missions and puts them in a totally different place. How are you thinking about that level of shift? Is it even on your radar? Yeah, I’m thinking about it right now. I think we overuse the form factor of our mobile devices right now for all kinds of things that it doesn’t need to be used for. I think a lot of those will be siphoned off into some other form factor. I especially think audio and voice is going to be a very big piece of it. But I don’t think that means that the form factor completely goes away. There are things that you need visual cues and references for where a screen is still going to be the dominant form factor. At least a piece of the dating equation is going to be that, for sure. Do you think we’ll get to a place where people’s agents are just dating each other and then reporting back? No, I don’t really think so. I think there are much better– Isn’t that what’s already happening in the matchmaking algorithm, in a very reductive way? Isn’t that what’s going on? I think in a very abstractive, reductive way, you could say that. But that’s not really what’s happening. We are not simulating dates. I think it’s a very expensive and inefficient way to do something that is actually much more straightforward. There’s just a part of me that says you’re going to have some competitor that attempts this, and we will all have to contend with it. I just think that’s a bit of a red herring for trying to map someone’s psyche and guess how they’re going to act. That adds a lot of complexity when actually you can just talk to people very directly about who they are and what they’re looking for and what matters to them, and compare that against someone else and what they describe, and actually make a lot of good connections and [get a] clear understanding in figuring out who should match with whom. Justin, this has been great. Tell people what’s next for Hinge. What should they be looking for? It really is the evolution of the product. I think that the shift to AI is going to be bigger than the shift to mobile for the industry. If you think about the big picture of what mobile did, it just made the process more approachable, faster, more fun, easier. But it was still the same fundamental experience of just cruising for people and trying to find someone based on very limited information, matching with them, trying to figure it out, going on a date, realizing this is not your person, trying to find the next date. We’re moving much closer to a world of really deep understanding of compatibility. Being able to zero in on the right person very quickly. It’s going to be a very transformative experience that I think is going to very much change people’s understanding and perception of the industry. So I’m really looking forward to the next couple of years, because I think that we will see more change than we’ve ever seen in the industry before. We’ll have to have you back to check in on how it’s going. Thanks so much for coming on Decoder. Great. Thank you. Questions or comments about this episode? Hit us up at decoder@theverge.com.

Title: Move over, Magnificent 7: Goldman Sachs proposes the ‘Prom 10,’ China’s top stocks including Tencent, Alibaba and BYD

Cecilia Hult is an editorial intern based in Hong Kong. Investors are flocking to Chinese markets in a search for alternatives to U.S. equities. DeepSeek’s AI breakthrough earlier this year proved that China could compete on the technological frontier. Economists are betting that Beijing might finally unleash more stimulus to revive flagging domestic consumption. And policy volatility in Washington, thanks to U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war, is pushing investors to start diversifying their portfolios away from the U.S. It’s a big shift from earlier arguments that Chinese companies were “uninvestable” due to concerns about policy uncertainty and China’s sluggish economy. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index is up by over 20% so far this year, even as Trump threatened steep tariffs on imports from China. By comparison, the S&P 500 is up by around 2%. Investors have used the “Magnificent 7”—Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla—as shorthand for the top-performing stocks on U.S. markets. These seven companies both reflect U.S. strength in Big Tech and tap into major trends like AI. But what about China? Investment bank Goldman Sachs, in a report released last week, highlighted 10 stocks that are best poised for growth in the Chinese market. Together, they make up what the bank calls the “Prominent 10”, or “Prom 10” for short. Unlike the Magnificent 7, these stocks cover more than just tech and AI, extending into retail and other consumer services. Together, the stocks amount to $1.6 trillion in market value, according to Goldman Sachs, compared to $19 trillion for the Mag 7. The bank predicts that the Prom 10’s earnings will grow by an average of 13% annually over the next two years. The Prom 10 “collectively embody the theme of AI/Tech development, self-sufficiency, ‘Going Global’, services and new forms of consumption, and China’s improving shareholder returns,” Goldman Sachs wrote in its report. The bank also suggests that its chosen companies have more opportunities to expand and consolidate their positions in the more fragmented Chinese economy. The most valuable company on the Prom 10 is Tencent, one of the world’s largest video game publishers and operator of the ubiquitous WeChat messaging app. Tencent’s superapp is one of a handful of platforms that boasts over a billion users. Valued at around $585 billion, Tencent is Asia’s second-most valuable company, behind chipmaker TSMC. E-commerce giant Alibaba is also on the Prom 10. Shares in the company are up more than 35% so far this year, thanks to optimism around AI. Developers both inside and outside of China are embracing the company’s open-source Qwen model, making Alibaba the AI leader among the country’s big tech companies. Meituan, China’s food delivery giant, is another Prom 10 stock. The company holds a 70% market share in the delivery space, and is expanding to new markets like Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, and Brazil. Yet the stock has taken a beating in recent weeks due to fierce competition from JD.com, another e-commerce giant. BYD, the world’s largest producer of electric vehicles, and Xiaomi, a major Chinese smartphone brand that’s recently expanded to cars, also hold spots in Goldman Sachs’ “Prom 10.” Chinese EVs are quickly winning over customers both in China and overseas, due to the affordable price points and appealing designs. That’s helped boost the shares of both companies: BYD and Xiaomi are up by around 45% and 60% respectively. Midea Group is one of China’s leading manufacturers of home appliances and another Prom 10 stock. The company debuted on Hong Kong’s stock exchange last year, raising almost $4 billion. Tencent, Alibaba, Meituan, Xiaomi, BYD, and Midea are all on Fortune’s Global 500, which ranks the world’s largest companies by revenue. Rounding out the Prom 10 are NetEase Games, the second-highest grossing gaming company in China; Hengrui, a leading pharmaceutical manufacturer; Trip.com, a travel booking platform; and ANTA, the world’s third-largest sportswear company, behind Nike and Adidas. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “No government has the right to decide on the truth of scientific principles.” — Richard Feynman, The Meaning of It All: Thoughts of a Citizen-Scientist (1998) Number of the Week: 35,000 MWh needed, 4.6 MWh approved THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: TWTW begins with a paper by Richard Lindzen and William Happer calling for a repeal of the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) which provided hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies to unreliable wind and solar. TWTW continues with the significant omissions in proclamations by NOAA and other organizations in claiming increasing carbon dioxide is acidifying the oceans. TWTW discusses assertions by organizations and individuals that climate misinformation should be criminalized, ignoring the fact that such organizations and individuals rely on information that fails to meet the standards of the scientific method. TWTW questions what is meant by an existential threat, then concludes with a presentation of part of the program of the upcoming DDP conference and where to register to attend in person or by Zoom. ********************* Repeal IRA Subsidies: Last week, TWTW focused on a paper by Richard Lindzen and William Happer emphasizing Gold Standard Science. “Scientific Knowledge Is Determined by the Scientific Method, Not by Government Opinion, Consensus, 97% of Scientists’ Opinions, Peer Review, Models that Do Not Work, or Cherry-Picked, Fabricated, Falsified or Omitted Contradictory Data.” This week, the CO2 Coalition published a paper by the same two authors titled “IRA Climate Subsidies Should Be Repealed.” The authors state: “Physics demonstrates that the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA’s) trillion-dollar climate subsidies rest on false science. The real science, which is virtually never reported, is that the IRA subsidies of $4.7 trillion (Cato’s estimate to 2050) aim to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will have no climate benefit, for two separate and cumulative reasons: First, the physics of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases shows that reducing them to net zero will have a negligible effect on temperatures and extreme weather. At present, there are no effective replacements for fossil fuels, and eliminating them will be disastrous for people worldwide. The scientific fact is that doubling carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would increase the world’s food supply by about 40%, with a trivial effect on Earth’s climate. Second, the theory that GHG emissions are the primary driver of climate change is based on false science, such as consensus, theoretical models that do not work, fabricated and falsified data, agenda-driven peer review and government opinions. None of this is real science. (See our June 7, 2025, paper for details, Physics Demonstrates That Increasing Greenhouse Gases Cannot Cause Dangerous Warming, Extreme Weather or Any Harm.) In summary, IRA subsidies will waste trillions of dollars for no climate benefit, reducing carbon dioxide emissions will reduce the amount of food worldwide, eliminating fossil fuels will be disastrous for people worldwide, and the trillions of dollars would be better spent improving Americans’ standard of living. Accordingly, all the IRA climate subsidies should be repealed ASAP.” See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ********************** Another Significant Omission: The false Endangerment Finding by the EPA under Lisa Jackson in 2009 under the Obama Administration asserts: “elevated concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may reasonably be anticipated to endanger the public health and to endanger the public welfare of current and future generations.” The finding ignores or omits contradictory evidence including the only comprehensive global temperature data existing, the estimates of temperature from satellite evidence calculated since 1979 by Roy Spencer and John Christy and published monthly by the Earth System Science Center, University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). Similar calculations by Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) independently verify their results. In 1998. Frank Wentz and Matthias Schabel of RSS discovered that UAH failed to correctly compensate for orbital drift. When the error was discovered and verified, Spencer and Christy quickly made appropriate adjustments, in keeping with the scientific method. Errors need to be exposed, verified, and corrected. Ignoring them or omitting them is contrary to the scientific method. For years, NOAA’s Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research has funded the Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), a climate modeling laboratory at Princeton. NOAA also funds the Cooperative Institute for Modeling the Earth System (CIMES), which is a collaboration between GFDL and Princeton University. For over forty years, GFDL and CIMES have ignored UAH data and have omitted validating their models against atmospheric data, which is where the greenhouse gas effect occurs. NOAA funds organizations that systematically ignore the scientific method and fail to test their predictions against physical evidence. The findings of these organizations cannot be considered scientific. Another NOAA activity that is considered scientific but fails the scientific method is ocean acidification which was boosted when environmental ecologist Jane Lubchenco was administrator of NOAA during the Obama administration from 2009 to 2013. The claim that adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere will acidify the oceans contains a bit of scientific fact surrounded by a bodyguard of lies and omissions. As a gas, water vapor contains no CO2 and has a pH of 7 which is neutral. But when it liquefies in the atmosphere and falls as rain, it absorbs CO2 making a weak acid, carbonic acid. All rain is carbonic acid and has a pH ranging from 4 to 6. Thus, it is common that in land areas with moderate to heavy rainfall, such as the tropics, the soils are acidic. Millions of years of rainfall have washed CO2 from the atmosphere into the oceans. Roughly, there is about 50 to 60 times more carbon dioxide in oceans than in the atmosphere. So, direct rainfall will slightly increase CO2 in the oceans, slightly lowering the pH. Yet after millions of years of rainfall, the oceans are alkaline with pH of about 8.1. A fact that NOAA and others ignore. To recall, the acidity or alkalinity of a solution is measured by the pH scale with 7 as neutral. The scale is a base 10 logarithm. Alkaline drain cleaner has a pH of about 14; bleach has a pH of about 13. Is bleach 10 times more acidic than alkaline drain cleaner? Hen eggs have a pH of about 8 (oceans 8.1); sweet cream butter has a pH of about 6.0 to 6.7. Does cooking eggs in butter make them acidic? Further, the areas in the oceans, called Marine primary production areas or regions, are areas where ocean upwellings bring carbon dioxide and other nutrients to the surface and marine life flourishes. Examples are the Grand Banks in the Atlantic off Canada, the area off Monterey, California, off Canada and Alaska, and off most of Europe. As with most such distortions, the claim of ocean acidification requires a huge ignorance of geological history. Mollusks evolved in the Cambrian explosion of life, about 540 million years ago, when CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere were about ten times what they are today. Marine creatures with shells containing calcium carbonate evolved before then, with even higher concentrations of CO2. Great limestone beds were laid down during the hot, high CO2 Cambrian period. Reef building corals evolved around 245 million years ago. Since then, Earth has experienced periods far hotter than today and periods with CO2 concentrations far greater than today. Reef-building corals have a symbiotic relationship with microscopic algae called zooxanthellae, which live within their tissues. The coral provides the algae with a protected environment and the carbon dioxide and nitrogen (for chlorophyll and other compounds) needed for photosynthesis, while the algae, through photosynthesis, provides the coral with energy, nutrients, and their vibrant colors. Changes in water temperatures, salinity, or solar irradiance can cause corals to expel the algae, turning them white. They are not dead but may need a different variety of zooxanthellae, which are diverse with many clades (groups of organisms believed to have a common ancestor) and types. There is no reason to assume that a modest lowering of pH will kill corals any more than slow changes in temperatures will kill them. However, human causes including sediment from land disturbances and destructive fishing practices such as using dynamite and cyanide do kill them. Water running into the oceans for millions of years often passes over many types of alkaline material resulting in a pH of about 8.1, alkaline. The best scientific explanation why increasing atmospheric concentrations of CO2 will not acidify the oceans TWTW has seen was written by the late Roger Cohen and William Happer ten years ago. The paper is mathematical, but the summary is clear. The authors begin the section titled Alkalinity of the Unbuffered Ocean with: Ocean water is salty because of the weathering of the earth’s rocks by rainwater, and because of salts dissolved from the ocean floor, especially near plate-spreading boundaries. The salt water contains positive ions (cations), mainly sodium Na+, magnesium Mg2+, calcium Ca2+ and potassium K+. For clarity, we can think of the ions as coming from the strong bases NaOH, and potassium hydroxide, KOH (lye) and much less soluble magnesium hydroxide, Mg(OH)2 and calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)2 (slaked lime). The ocean also contains negative ions (anions), mainly chloride Cl− and sulfate SO4− 2, which we can think of the anions as coming from the strong acids, hydrochloric acid, HCl and sulfuric acid, H2SO4. For want of a better word, we will refer to the cations of strong bases, and anions of strong acids as pH-independent ions. The concentration of pH-independent ions is unaffected by normal changes in the pH of water. Further, the authors explain how weak acids (notably carbonic acid (H2CO3)) make rainwater slightly acidic, with a pH = 5.4 (vinegar has pH ~ 3). The authors estimate that if the oceans were not buffered by weak acids, the oceans would have a pH of about 11.4. The Summary states [figures not shown here, boldface added]: “This minimalist discussion already shows how hard it is to scare informed people with ocean acidification, but, alas, many people are not informed. For example: • The oceans would be highly alkaline with a pH of about 11.4, similar to that of household ammonia, if there were no weak acids to buffer the alkalinity. Almost all of the buffering is provided by dissolved CO2, with very minor additional buffering from boric acid, silicic acid, and other even less important species. • Doubling atmospheric CO2 from the current level of 400 ppm to 800 ppm only decreases the pH of ocean water from about 8.2 to 7.9. This is well within the day-night fluctuations that already occur because of photosynthesis by plankton and less than the pH decreases with depth that occur because of the biological pump and the dissolution of calcium carbonate precipitates below the lysocline. [The depth where the rate of dissolution of calcium carbonate starts to increase significantly due to these changes in pressure and temperature.] • Doubling atmospheric CO2 from the current level of 400 ppm to 800 ppm only decreases the carbonate-ion concentration, [CO2− 3], by about 30%. Ocean surface waters are already supersaturated by several hundred per cent for formation of CaCO3 crystals from Ca2+ and CO2− 3. So, scare stories about dissolving carbonate shells are nonsense. • The ocean has only absorbed 1/3 or less of the CO2 that it would eventually absorb when the concentrations of CO2 in the deep oceans came to equilibrium with surface concentrations. Effects like that of the biological pump and calcium carbonate dissolution below the lysocline allow the ocean to absorb substantially more than the amount that would be in chemical-equilibrium with the atmosphere. • Over most of the Phanerozoic, the past 550 million years, CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere have been measured in thousands of parts per million, and life flourished in both the oceans and on land. This is hardly surprising, given the relative insensitivity of ocean pH to large changes in CO2 concentrations that we have discussed above and given the fact that the pH changes that do occur are small compared to the natural variations of ocean pH in space and time.” This is another instance where US government “science” is so politicized that it becomes nonsense. See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ********************** Censorship: An organization called the International Panel on the Information Environment has produced a report titled: “Facts, Fakes, and Climate Science: Recommendations for Improving Information Integrity about Climate Science.” The Synopsis of the report states: Misleading information about the causes and consequences of climate change obstructs effective policy responses. This Summary for Policymakers summarizes findings from the larger Synthesis Report “Information Integrity about Climate Science: A Systematic Review” (SR2025.1). The central conclusion of the Synthesis Report is that powerful actors—including corporations, governments, and political parties—intentionally spread inaccurate or misleading narratives about anthropogenic climate change. These narratives circulate across digital, broadcast, and interpersonal communication channels. The result is a decline in public trust, diminished policy coordination, and a feedback loop between scientific denialism and political inaction. There is a severe gap in research on climate information integrity in the Global South, where impacts are likely to be significant but poorly documented. Key takeaways from the synthesis include: 1. coordinated misinformation campaigns actively shape climate narratives; 2. scientific consensus is frequently misrepresented in media; 3. regulatory enforcement and access to data remain uneven globally; 4. information integrity research is heavily concentrated in the Global North. The report concludes with an assessment of policy recommendations that have been made over time, identifying for policymakers the four areas where impact has been consistently positive: • legislation to ensure standardized carbon reporting and labelling, • litigation to ensure enforcement of the standards, • coalition building across stakeholder groups, • education of policymakers and the public. This study delivers the first global, systematic assessment of information integrity about climate science. It draws on research by hundreds of scholars and thousands of peer-reviewed studies published over the past decade, with a methodologically rigorous review of 300 papers on policy solutions. This consolidated evidence base affirms a scientific consensus and specifies the urgent measures policymakers must enact to shield humankind—and the planet we depend on—from an accelerating climate threat. In short, this group proclaims that it understands scientific knowledge from “scientific consensus” and any group presenting physical evidence contradicting them should be punished. This organization produced another report titled: “Information Integrity about Climate Science: A Systematic Review.” It claims that [citations omitted here but in report, boldface added]: “The United Nations (UN) has played an important role in placing the issue of information integrity on public and policy agendas, including for the area of climate change. In 2024, the United Nations Global Principles for Information Integrity were presented; that year also witnessed the launch of the Global Initiative for Information Integrity on Climate Change, spearheaded by Brazil and coordinated through UNESCO. The Global Principles highlighted the need for ‘independent, free and pluralistic media’ around the world as vehicles of information and opinion formation. They also called for more “transparency and research” into whether and how traditional media and online communication platforms maintain information integrity in the public interest. That publication, however, stopped short of offering an explicit or operational definition of information integrity. This consolidated evidence base affirms a scientific consensus and specifies the urgent measures policymakers (see SFP2025.2) must enact to shield humankind— and the planet we depend on—from an accelerating climate threat.” Writing in WUWT, Eric Worrall uncovered a UN Human Rights Council report that calls for punishment of those who oppose abandoning fossil fuels. The summary of the report states: “The present report clarifies States’ international human rights obligations and businesses’ responsibilities to phase out fossil fuels and related subsidies within the current decade. The interlinked, intergenerational, severe and widespread human rights impacts of the fossil fuel life cycle, coupled with six decades of climate obstruction, compel urgent defossilization of our whole economies, for a just transition that is effective, human rights based and transformative in protecting the climate, nature, water and food on which life and health for present and future generations depend.” [Boldface added] For example, Richard Lindzen and William Happer used the scientific method to expose the folly of Net Zero. Are they to be punished for producing physical evidence contradicting the claims of the UN organizations which, for years, have led the effort to abandon fossil fuels which are needed for reliable electricity, heat, and transportation? Do UN bureaucrats and their defenders believe they have the right to determine the truth of scientific principles? The quote of the week is: “No government has the right to decide on the truth of scientific principles.” — Richard Feynman. If misinformation on the causes and extent of climate change becomes a criminal offence, would the UN be a criminal organization? Has the UN become an advocate for causing destitute poverty and starvation (by prohibiting use of artificial fertilizer which produce greenhouse gases)? See links under Defending the Orthodoxy and Defending the Orthodoxy – Bandwagon Science ********************** An Existential Threat? It is commonplace for promoters of fear of climate change to call climate change an existential threat. But what the term means is not clear. Clinical psychologist Andrew Hartz provides an explanation of the use of existential threat. See Article # 1. ********************** DDP Conference: The 23rth annual meeting of the Doctors for Disaster Preparedness will be held in Tucson, Arizona, from July 4 to 6. The program features the 2022 Nobel co-Laureate in Physics John Clauser speaking on “Serious errors and fudges in the IPCC et al.’s global power balance structure, albedo, and climate feedback assessments.” Other noted speakers of interest to TWTW readers include Willie Soon, “Measuring the Earth’s Energy Budget”: Michael Connolly “Balloons in the Air: Revisiting Atmospheric Physics, with Data”; Joe Leimkuhler, “Prospects for the U.S. Petroleum Industry”; Jim Steele “Understanding Natural Climate Dynamics Best Prepares Us for Weather Disasters”; and David Legates “9.5 Weeks: My Time in the White House.” For registration in person or by Zoom see https://aaps.wufoo.com/forms/q1f6wbjr18g6o47/ ********************* SEPP’S APRIL FOOLS AWARD – THE JACKSON It is time for voting on the Annual SEPP’s April Fools Award – the Jackson. The grand prize is a large lump of coal. Last year, the deserving winner of the lump of coal was the US National Science Teaching Association. In 2023, the Association banned the CO2 Coalition from its meeting which the Coalition members paid for and were approved because the CO2 Coalition exhibit pointed out that CO2 is essential for photosynthesis which is the food source of all complex life on Earth. There are many strong candidates for this dubious honor including leaders of US scientific agencies who signed off on questionable reports on climate change. Get your votes in by June 29 with the reason why you recommend that person for the award. Send your vote to Ken@Sepp.org. If you wish, you will be anonymous. The award will be announced at the 43rd annual meeting of the Doctors for Disaster Preparedness on July 5-6. The decision of the judges is final. ********************* Number of the Week: 35,000 MWh needed, 4.6 MWh approved. DEMAND: On June 20, the business day with the longest period of sunlight, the California Independent Systems Operator (CAISO) reported that the demand trend for electricity fell to its lowest point at about 12:30 pm (local time) with a demand of 19,500 MW. About 6:30 pm demand began peaking at 28,000 MW and remained there or above until 10 pm when it slowly fell to 25,000 MW. Except between about 10 am and 3 pm, demand did not go below 22,000 MW. SUPPLY: On the same day, renewables (Solar, Wind, Geothermal, Biomass, Biogas, and Small Hydro) reached a near peak of about 25,000 MW at 8:30 am and remained there or more until 5:30 pm when they fell dramatically to about 7,500 MW at 8 pm where they remained the rest of the evening. When it is functioning solar is the biggest generator at over 18,000 MW with wind second at about 5,000 MW. Large hydro provided an average of about 3,750 MW for the rest of the evening and Nuclear about 2,280 MW. The rest of the electricity came from imports (mostly coal and other fossil fuels), and batteries. The government of California is trying to close its remaining nuclear power plant, small hydro and all fossil fuel power imports and rely on solar, wind, and storage. On the longest business day of the year for sunshine, after 8:00 pm CAISO needed 28,000 MW of power until 10 pm when it slowly fell to 25,000 MW while renewables were delivering 7,500 MW and batteries were delivering between 7,000 and 8,000 MW until 10 pm when they declined. Based on rough calculations, just for that evening (8 pm to midnight) CAISO needed 110,000 MWh of power while renewables delivered 30,000 MWh and the power delivered by large hydro alone was about 14,280 MWh. Thus, taking away nuclear, the shortfall would be about 35,000 MWh. Existing batteries delivered about 27,000 MWh and California just approved the “World’s Largest’ Energy Storage Site” with 4,600 kWh (4.6 MWh) of battery storage with no costs given. If California goes net zero with no nuclear, what will California do on a cold, windless night in January? How will it replenish its batteries? If California cannot deliver the nuclear power needed by the Bonneville Power Administration to supplement its large hydro, will the Administration continue to deliver hydropower to California? According to the US EIA, except for isolated Hawaii, residential electricity prices in California are already the highest in the country. In March, the US national average was 17.11 cents per kilowatt-hour, while in California it was 32.41 cents per kilowatt-hour and Hawaii 41.11.

The problem with this hypothesis is: Why is the concentration of CO2 today significantly greater than the previous interglacial warm periods over the past 3 million years?] Rupert Darwall: World Leaders Took a Wrong Turn By Ron Clutz, His Blog, June 20, 2025 Video, Transcript by Clutz Interviewer: When you think about the age of error, when do you think it began, can you set a date to that precisely? Darwall: Yes, I think I can. Because in 2006 there was the meeting of the G8 which was in St Petersburg hosted by Vladimir Putin.

Santer, Susan Solomon, et al., PNAS, June 16, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] From the abstract: The physics of the heat-trapping properties of CO were established in the mid-19th century, as fossil fuel burning rapidly increased atmospheric CO levels. To date, however, research has not probed when climate change could have been detected if scientists in the 19th century had the current models and observing network. We consider this question in a thought experiment with state-of-the-art climate models. [SEPP Comment: A thought fantasy, not a thought experiment. The state-of-the-art climate models produce results that are wrong. Why bother with a thought experiment until the state-of-the-art models produce accurate predictions that are supported by physical evidence? Further, in the mid-19th century, Europe was emerging from the Little Ice Age which killed hundreds of thousands from starvation and related diseases. Why would warming be considered harmful to humanity? Finally, the authors cite the early work of Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius but not his 1908 paper which admitted his early work was wrong.

Or not, once they see how tiny the effects are in the alarmists’ own calculations. For instance, if we assume climate sensitivity to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 is a 3°C temperature increase, and that the US cuts its emissions right away by 40 percent, by the year 2100 global warming will have been reduced by… 0.06 degrees C.

Beijing began building 94.5 gigawatts (GW) of new coal-powered capacity in 2024, in addition to resuming 3.3 GW of suspended projects. This is the highest level of construction in the past 10 years! As recently as May, China deployed the world’s largest fleet of driverless mining trucks to fast-track efficient operations, partially to overcome the challenging conditions of harsh winter weather at the Yimin coal mine in northeastern Inner Mongolia. Oceans absorb 30% of our emissions, driven by a huge carbon pump.

Communicating Better to the Public – Use Yellow (Green) Journalism? A weak wind By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, June 18, 2025 So, what has the Washington Post to say on the quietest hurricane season globally since 1970? Why, it was completely quiet about it. (As it was on “climate” save for a mention of a prediction from the Climate Prediction Center.) Unless you count “This spurt of activity shows no signs of ending for now.” Yes. “This spurt of activity” is actually how they describe the quietest start to a season in more than half a century. Satire can’t keep up. And no matter how cynical you get, it’s not enough. Major Errors in Seattle Times ClimateLab Article on Sea-level Rise By Cliff Mass, Weather Blog, June 20, 2025 My frustration with the often false, misleading, and exaggerated information pushed by the Seattle Times ClimateLab is frequently expressed in this blog, but the tall tales provided this week is worth a rating of at least four Pinocchios. The story suggests that the Samish Tribe of NW Washington has to “race” to document their heritage sites because rising sea level and “intensifying storm surges” remove any chance to understand their significance.” In reality, none of this is true.

Consequently, our understanding of the microplastics distribution across ocean depths is more limited. Here we synthesize depth-profile data from 1,885 stations collected between 2014 and 2024 to provide insights into the distribution and potential transport mechanisms of subsurface (below about 50-cm depth, which is not usually sampled by traditional practices) microplastics throughout the oceanic water column.

Can they say with a straight face that they’ve measured global temperature comprehensively to that degree of precision? Of course not. We’re not even buying the 0.1, let alone the 2 that followed it. As for that estimated 1850-1900 average, as we’ve said before, if you think we know the temperature for every square foot of what was then the Belgian Congo in 1873, or the mid-Pacific, or for that matter Rome, you are a chump or worse. IRA Incentives Fuel U.S. Solar Manufacturing Surge By Aaron Larson, Power Mag, June 11, 2025 The centerpiece of this revival is the IRA’s comprehensive package of tax incentives designed to rebuild America’s solar supply chain. The domestic content bonus tax credit offers project developers an additional 10% on top of the base 30% investment tax credit (ITC) when they use U.S.-made components. This creates demand-side pull for domestically manufactured solar products. According to U.S. Treasury Department data, more than $196 billion in clean power investments have been announced since the IRA’s passage, demonstrating the market’s strong response to these incentives. [Boldface added] [SEPP Comment: More deceit, America never had a solar supply chain to rebuild.] Communicating Better to the Public – Use Propaganda Amber Alerts For Sunny Weather By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, June 19, 2025 “Amber heat health alerts are in place across the whole of England with temperatures likely to exceed 30C [86F] for the first time this year.” Meanwhile back in the real world, summer remains the season when deaths tolls are at their lowest: ‘Climate Grieving’ at UK Centre for Climate Psychology By Robert Bradley Jr., Master Resource, June 17, 2025 The organization has a flagship book, Climate, Psychology and Change: Reimagining Psychotherapy in an Era of Global Disruption and Climate Anxiety.

Questioning European Green Kathryn Porter Reviews The Spanish Blackouts Report By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, June 20, 2025 Link to: Should NESO [UK Electrical system operator] be allowed to lower its minimum inertia requirement? By Kathryn Porter, Watt-Logic, June 18, 2025 From Porter: Whether this ambition will be possible even with the dodgy carbon accounting rules is unclear. In the summer months, gas power stations are often turned up by the system operator in order to stabilize the grid, providing important inertia to control voltage across the network. Throughout the summer, NESO has observed unexplained voltage oscillations (which I will discuss in another post – this is being held up by junk frequency data being reported to Elexon which has yet to be corrected, despite Elexon requesting re-submission), including on the day before the Iberian blackout. These oscillations can, in extreme circumstances, cause the type of grid failure that led to the loss of eleven lives on 28 April in Spain and Portugal.

Oh. Not so good? For instance, from way down south we hear that “The initial cost of producing green hydrogen from Australia’s two largest projects will be more than four times the price of rival energy sources, posing a fresh setback for Labor’s bid to deliver a major new export ­industry by 2030 and meet net-zero goals.” And you told us you had it all figured out. Blockbuster: Mark Carney, Mr Net-Zero-Banker himself, now uses oil, gas to make Canada an Energy SuperPower By Jo Nova, Her Blog, June 17, 2025 The US is the world’s top producer of oil at the moment, with 44 billion barrels of oil in reserve. Amazingly Canada has four times as much — or 171 billion barrels of oil in recoverable reserves, says the Telegraph. It’s amazing how stupid rich countries can be — to leave, as Alberta’s premier says, “$9 trillion worth of oil wealth we have in the ground”? Speaking of stupid, perhaps the greatest and saddest irony is that Mark Carney once was the green-extreme Governor of the Bank of England. And while there, he helped tie the UK down in carbon markets and energy transitions that still cripple their economy.

The Lethal Fog of Clean-Air Hypocrisy By Vijay Jayaraj, CO2 Coalition, June 18, 2025 Why do environmental extremists expect Nairobi, Dhaka or Lagos to skip the rational evolution of energy use that so benefited the lives and economies of the U.K. – and of many other western nations? Why do they think an African mother should wait decades – or forever – to cook without smoke? The answer lies in an elitist worldview that treats energy as a lifestyle choice rather than a lifeline. America as a Reliable Energy Partner By Fred H.

The flashpoint is centered on when large customers seek to bypass conventional transmission planning and cost allocation by co-locating directly with generation sources. That practice, often framed as “behind-the-meter” or “non-network” load development, has raised concerns from grid operators, utilities, and regulators who argue that even ostensibly self-supplied data centers still rely on the broader grid for backup, balancing, and reliability services.

The ultimate goal of energy tax credits is not to reduce tax burdens, but to help companies bring a larger amount of lower-cost and cleaner energy to the market — benefiting the American people. Cash is often preferable to tax credits in accomplishing that goal. The third policy is all the more relevant given this demand surge: restoring support for solar leasing companies. Solar leasing directly benefits U.S. homeowners by allowing them to install panels on their property with a monthly payment plan instead of swallowing the upfront cost. Not only does rooftop solar drive down consumer electricity costs, but it also gives Americans more independence by helping them to get off the grid and cut their reliance on utility companies.

This shift marks a departure from its traditionally left-leaning roots, as companies attempt to appeal to conservative consumers and policymakers.

By Leslie Eastman, Legal Insurrection, June 16, 2025 The greatest oxymoron statement of all time: ‘Renewable Energy’ By Ronald Stein and Roger Caiazza, America Out Loud News, June 16, 2025 Wind and solar projects that generate electricity under favorable weather conditions only exist because of government subsidies that finance these projects. To date, none of the wind and solar projects around the world have ever been financed with private capital, as there is no return on such investments. Claims that renewables are cheaper overlook the costs of backing up those sources when the sun does not shine and the wind does not blow. When included, costs are much higher.

At the bottom of the vogue for this exotic term may be the basic human fear of death. By Andrew Hartz. WSJ, June 16, 2025 TWTW Summary: The clinical psychologist and the founder of the Open Therapy Institute begins with: “So-called existential risks seem to be everywhere. Climate change, artificial intelligence, nuclear war, pandemics and more threaten to return us to nothingness. Most people using this term aren’t consciously evoking the philosophy of Sartre or Camus. Still, they may be drawing on associations with existentialism more than they realize and unconsciously expressing deeper concerns about morality and meaning. In psychoanalysis, it isn’t unusual for a word to have an unconscious double meaning. For example, a patient in therapy might say that she can’t ‘bear’ children. She could consciously mean that she’s unable to get pregnant, while also unconsciously communicating that she can’t stand children. Or a grieving patient who’s struggling to find the right word might say, ‘I’m at a loss.’ Similarly, the word ‘existential’ points to catastrophic global threats, but it also echoes the concerns of existentialist philosophy, which addresses a range of topics from freedom to alienation. But the term is most strongly linked in the public imagination to issues of death and meaning. Saying an issue is ‘existential’ can express that it’s deeply tied to one’s fear of dying and need for purpose. We don’t have to overthink every word we say or hear, but there are signals that a word may have an unconscious double meaning. Therapists tend to think this phenomenon is most likely to occur when a word is used in an odd way—when it’s emotionally charged, when it’s repeated excessively or when it has clear resonance with one’s psychological concerns. The recent political use of the word ‘existential’ seems to check every box. People in the U.S. are shouting about how politics is ‘existential’ at the same time that American society is suffering from a marked crisis of purpose. The term is strange and was used rarely in the past, but its use has been increasing as people have become less able to tolerate the risks and uncertainties of life. Recent events—the pandemic, geopolitical conflicts, the increasing secularization of society—could have triggered Americans’ existential concerns. Perhaps other factors are at play as well. For many, social-media platforms intensify feelings of insignificance. A loneliness epidemic might heighten anxieties about meaning. Distrust of authority can lead to feelings of confusion and insecurity. Whatever the causes, the sense that everything is an existential crisis is likely exacerbated by the increasing emotional fragility of younger generations. A prominent psychological theory, Terror Management Theory, posits that all people have anxiety about their mortality and that they cope with it in predictable ways. A robust body of evidence indicates that when people are reminded of their death, they try to boost their self-esteem, take steps to create a legacy and defend their worldview—be it secular or religious. An extension of this theory is that people cope with anxiety about death by focusing their fears onto something more tangible, such as a current political cause. That cause can then become emotionally loaded with all of their anxiety and distress about mortality. This temporarily makes their anxiety feel more manageable, but it’s likely to contribute to fanaticism and emotional dysregulation around politics. Political causes aimed at tackling ‘existential’ risks are often associated with safety culture. People seem to have an unconscious hope that regulations could protect them from ever dying. Sometimes, these rules and rituals even take on an obsessive-compulsive quality, as if the repetitions will magically stave off unknown risks. Many Covid practices had this flavor.” The author states the most clinicians think that fears of annihilation are fundamental influences on behavior which results in outlooks such as the world is going to be destroyed. He then concludes with: “Often, people come to yearn for an omnipotent state as the means to protect them from all their fears. They imagine total state control to protect them from all the internal feelings they can’t tolerate. Anxieties like this can easily become fodder for authoritarianism. Politics won’t solve our deeper problems. Meaning and purpose have to be found on one’s own, and people must develop ways to manage the uncertainties and risks of life. This can be challenging, but it’s the only path toward fulfillment, wisdom and freedom—to say nothing of mental health.” Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.

I’m not rich, but I’ve done ok for myself. Although I’m not sure today’s kids have enough gumption to get off their fat arses and make something of themselves. As the ocean warms, a new study found it’s also changing color https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article308985125.html Supreme Court Rules Fuel Producers Can Contest California’s Emissions Regulations The 7-2 ruling emphasized that it was not considering the substance of the dispute itself, but solely whether the producers had the legal standing to bring the lawsuit. The justices in a 7-2 ruling overturned a lower court’s decision to throw out the lawsuit by a Valero Energy (VLO.N) subsidiary and fuel industry groups. The lower court had concluded that the plaintiffs lacked the required legal standing to challenge a 2022 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency decision to let California set its own regulations. “The government generally may not target a business or industry through stringent and allegedly unlawful regulation, and then evade the resulting lawsuits by claiming that the targets of its regulation should be locked out of court as unaffected bystanders,” conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote for the majority. What is this? “ If California cannot deliver the nuclear power needed by the Bonneville Power Administration to supplement its large hydro, will the Administration continue to deliver hydropower to California?” I was not aware that CA exported nuclear power to the BPA. “An organization called the International Panel on the Information Environment has produced a report titled: “Facts, Fakes, and Climate Science: Recommendations for Improving Information Integrity about Climate Science.” What a name! Why not just call themselves “The Ministry of Truth”? The government of California is trying to close its remaining nuclear power plant, small hydro and all fossil fuel power imports and rely on solar, wind, and storage. And what is so ridiculous is that even could they manage to do it, it would have no material effect on the level of global emissions. Because California is not a big enough emitter for it to make much difference to the global total. It is utterly crazy how people insist on doing these expensive and completely ineffective things ‘because climate’, when even if the theory is correct, they will make no difference to the climate.

Δ Overall, the index slipped a scant 0.02%, as six pillars lost ground and five pillars advanced. In doing so, the CE 100 pantheon outperformed all of its broader benchmarks, as, for example, the S&P lost 0.5%. Banking names surged the most, adding 3%. LendingClub advanced by 5.3%. The company announced the rollout of its LevelUp Checking. The new offering is designed to help consumers move away from reliance on credit cards, especially given record-high credit card debt, by incentivizing the use of debit with rewards tied to debit spending. Target customers are individuals with high FICO scores (around 725) and high incomes ($125,000 to $130,000) who, despite their earnings, often lack immediate cash and carry substantial credit card debt, CEO Scott Sanborn told PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster. “We’re saying that if rewards are important to you, that’s great, so let’s reward you for good behavior,” Sanborn told Webster in an interview. The new LevelUp Checking product gives members 1% cash back for everyday spending with a LevelUp debit card on grocery and gas, among other key categories. Members who have LendingClub personal loans can also receive 2% cash back for making on-time loan payments from the LevelUp accounts. JPMorgan Chase plans to launch a product called a “deposit token” that will serve as a digital representation of commercial bank money and will be available only to the bank’s institutional clients. The deposit token, dubbed “JPMD,” will provide an alternative to stablecoins and will be closely connected to traditional banking systems. JPMorgan Chase will launch JPMD on Coinbase’s public blockchain, Base. JPMorgan’s stock gained 3.8%. In the Pay and Be Paid segment, up 0.3%, Visa has partnered with licensed stablecoin payments orchestrator Yellow Card to explore stablecoin use cases and opportunities across the African markets in which Yellow Card is licensed to operate. Together, the companies will seek opportunities to help streamline treasury operations and enhance liquidity management as well as test integration opportunities with Visa Direct to investigate cross-border payment options, Visa said. Visa’s stock lost 4%. But buy now, pay later names were higher, marked by Sezzle’s 10% rally and Affirm’s 5% boost. As PYMNTS reported, Affirm has announced a new revolving pass-through loan sale facility in which PGIM Fixed Income, a Prudential Financial company, will invest up to $3 billion over 36 months by purchasing up to $500 million of Affirm loans at any one time. This facility, which marks an expansion of the companies’ existing capital partnership, will support Affirm’s offering of pay-over-time options to consumers, the companies said. The Be Well sector led declining stocks, losing 2.5%. Peloton dipped by 11%, trading lower since news earlier this month that Peloton introduced its own peer-to-peer resale marketplace, Repowered. Users can list their pre-owned equipment and accessories from the connected fitness company on the Repowered platform. Sellers determine the listing price, aided by a generative artificial intelligence (AI) tool. In the Enablers group, which lost 0.3%, OpenAI’s Sam Altman has reportedly accused Meta of offering nine-figure signing bonuses to poach his workers. Shares gave up 0.7%. Amazon’s stock lost 1.1%. In a message penned by CEO Andy Jassy, and as reported by PYMNTS, employees who have learned how to use AI will be better positioned to be a part of Amazon in the future. Jassy added that Amazon’s total corporate workforce is likely to shrink over the next few years as the company adopts AI. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” Jassy said in the message.

Cookies help us display personalized product recommendations and ensure you have great shopping experience. Accept X Since we took over Smart Data Collective, we’ve made it a priority to focus on how artificial intelligence influences the practical side of data mining. You often hear about machine learning in broad strokes, but we aim to look at how these tools handle the messy reality of raw data. You can’t overstate the damage poor data quality causes. It is estimated by IBM that this issue costs U.S. businesses over $3.1 trillion every year. Keep reading to learn more. There are many ways AI helps clean up large datasets, especially in eliminating duplicates, correcting formats, and filling in gaps. You might have hundreds of spreadsheets from various sources, but AI can bring consistency to it all. You save hundreds of hours compared to doing it manually. It is easy to forget how quickly companies have scaled up their spending on AI tools. CNBC reports that Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft alone plan to spend up to $320 billion on AI and datacenter infrastructure in 2025. You can see how high the stakes have become when tech giants place that much of their budget behind it. There are not many industries left untouched by this trend. You might assume only tech companies are involved, but even traditional sectors are leaning on AI for their data work. There are organizations earning over $500 million a year, and according to Computer Weekly, they’re putting 5% of their revenue into AI projects. You often need advanced tools just to keep up with the amount of data modern businesses generate. It is not just about cleaning and sorting—AI also helps find patterns in customer behavior, supply chains, and market trends. You can build models that predict when people are most likely to make a purchase or when a part in a machine is likely to fail. There are no shortcuts, but AI brings new power to long-standing business challenges. I still remember the first time I tried to scrape data from a website for a project. I was hunched over my laptop, wrestling with Python scripts, cursing at broken CSS selectors, and wondering if the website’s layout would change before I could even finish my code. Fast forward to today, and the world of data extraction has been completely flipped on its head. The rise of AI web scrapers has not only made my life easier, but it’s also reshaping how entire data teams work—making data more accessible, workflows more efficient, and headaches a lot less frequent. Let’s be honest: the sheer volume of data online is exploding. In 2024, the world created about 149 zettabytes of data, and that number is expected to hit 181 zettabytes by 2025. With 97% of businesses investing in big data and 81% saying data is at the heart of decision-making, the pressure on data teams to deliver timely, high-quality web data has never been higher. But traditional scraping tools just can’t keep up. Enter the age of AI web scrapers—where automation, context-awareness, and accessibility are changing the rules for everyone. So, what exactly is an AI web scraper? Unlike the old-school scrapers that rely on brittle CSS selectors or XPath rules, AI web scrapers use natural language processing, computer vision, and pattern recognition to “read” web pages more like a human would. Instead of telling the tool, “Go grab the third <td> in this table,” you can just say, “Extract product names, prices, and ratings from this page,” and let the AI figure out the rest. What’s really exciting is the rise of AI agents—these are smart automation bots that can interpret your instructions, adapt to different websites, and even handle dynamic content or subpages. Tools like Thunderbit are leading the way here, making it possible for non-technical users (like sales teams, marketers, or real estate analysts) to scrape clean, structured data in just a couple of clicks. No more late-night debugging sessions or praying that your script survives the next website redesign. Having spent years in the trenches with Python scripts and selector-based tools, I can tell you: traditional web scraping is a slog. Tools like Oxylabs, Bright Data API, Octoparse, and ParseHub all require you to set up extraction rules for each website. That means: And let’s not forget the skill gap. Most traditional scrapers require at least some coding chops, which means business users are stuck waiting for the data team to build or fix things. It’s a bottleneck that slows everyone down. Let’s break it down: building a robust scraper for a single site can take hours or even days. Maintenance is an ongoing battle—one small change in the HTML and your whole pipeline can grind to a halt. Add in the need for proxies, anti-bot measures, and infrastructure for scaling, and suddenly your “quick script” is a full-blown engineering project. And the kicker? All that effort is just to keep the data flowing. If you’re dealing with dozens or hundreds of sites, the maintenance alone can eat up a huge chunk of your team’s time and budget. Here’s where AI web scrapers really shine. By leveraging natural language processing and visual analysis, these tools automate the whole data extraction process. You don’t need to know HTML, CSS, or even what a selector is. Just describe what you want, and the AI agent takes care of the rest. This shift is huge for data teams. Instead of spending hours configuring and maintaining scripts, you can set up a new extraction in minutes. And because the AI understands context, it’s much more resilient to changes in website layout or dynamic content. I’ve seen firsthand how much easier things get with tools like Thunderbit. You just click “AI Suggest Fields,” let the AI read the page, and then hit “Scrape.” That’s it. No more wrestling with selectors or worrying about whether the site uses infinite scroll. The AI figures out what’s important, structures the data, and even handles subpages or dynamic elements. It almost feels like cheating—but in the best way possible. Let’s sum up the big wins: This is my favorite part. With traditional tools, you’d need a custom script for every site. But with AI web scrapers, a single tool can generalize across multiple websites. That means faster project turnaround, less repetitive work, and more time spent on analysis instead of data wrangling. For example, Thunderbit’s AI can scrape product listings from Amazon, property data from Zillow, or contact info from niche directories—all with the same workflow. That’s a game plan for scaling up your data operations without scaling up your headaches. Let’s get concrete. Here are some scenarios where AI web scrapers are making a real difference for data teams: For more on these use cases, check out Thunderbit’s blog. Dynamic websites used to be the bane of every scraper’s existence. JavaScript-loaded content, infinite scroll, pop-ups—traditional tools would choke or require complex workarounds. AI web scrapers, on the other hand, can mimic human browsing, interact with dynamic elements, and adapt to layout changes on the fly. This resilience means less downtime, fewer maintenance emergencies, and a lot less stress for data teams. It’s like having a super-adaptable assistant who never complains about late-night website redesigns. Thinking about making the switch? Here’s how I’d approach it: For a step-by-step guide, check out How to Scrape Any Website Using AI. Looking ahead, I see AI web scrapers getting even smarter and more integrated into business workflows. We’re talking about: The bottom line? Data teams will spend less time on extraction and more time on strategy, analysis, and decision-making. The rise of AI web scrapers is more than just a technological upgrade—it’s a shift in how data teams operate. We’re moving from manual, brittle, and high-maintenance workflows to a world where automation, adaptability, and accessibility are the norm. If your team is still stuck in the old world of manual scripts and selector headaches, it’s time to take a look at what AI web scrapers can do. Tools like Thunderbit are making it easier than ever to turn the web into your personal data warehouse—no code, no stress, just results. Ready to see what’s possible?

Title: Geopolitical Market Risk: Israel-Iran War & Oil

More impact oil supply and thus choke global economic growth. This piece examines the impact of past geopolitical events on markets and the potential US economic implications of the Israel-Iran conflict. Vector illustration Beyond the obvious humanitarian tragedy that surrounds any armed conflict, the Israel-Iran war has crucial possible implications for the global economy. With the U.S. striking Iranian nuclear sites, there is a concern that a spreading conflict could impact oil supply and thus choke global economic growth. This piece will examine the impact of past geopolitical events on markets and the potential implications of the Israel-Iran conflict. When Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, there were some similar concerns to today. The S&P 500 was down 3.3% in the week following and took months to recover. By the following year, stocks were over 10% higher. The backdrop was quite different from today, though, with the U.S. in the midst of a recession and the Savings & Loan crisis. To be clear, even though they are luckily in the minority, there are events like World War II or September 11, where markets are significantly lower a year after the initiation of hostilities. Stock Performance After 29 Major Geopolitical Events Since the start of the current Israel-Iran hostilities on June 13, the S&P 500 has been 1.2% lower. Stocks were little changed last week. The S&P 500 is 2.9% below its mid-February high, having declined by almost 20%. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has recovered to 8.7% below its mid-December level. Market Returns Since the war began on June 12, the price of WTI crude oil has increased by 10.1%. Since energy, with oil being a significant part of that mix, is a key fuel for all economic growth, past spikes in oil prices have been associated with economic downturns. On the surface, the increase in prices does not seem extreme enough to collapse economic activity. The price remains well below the 2022 spike on both a nominal and, more importantly, inflation-adjusted basis. Oil Prices Notably, the U.S. and the world have become much more efficient in the utilization of energy. This improved efficiency has translated into a lower proportion of consumer spending allocated to energy, even at the same oil price. In other words, consumers are less negatively affected by oil price increases than in the past. Percent Of Total Spending On Energy To be clear, higher oil prices are still felt by the consumer. One need only think back to the adverse reaction to high gasoline prices in 2022 to prove the point. Furthermore, like tariffs, the higher oil and gasoline prices weigh more heavily on lower-income households than on higher-income households, as they spend a larger percentage of their income on energy. US Retail Gasoline Prices Fracking changed the story of U.S. oil production more than many appreciate. U.S. domestic oil production began to decline in the 1970s and reached its lowest point in 2008. Since then, fracking has led to production surging to all-time highs. US Domestic Crude Oil Production The U.S. has now become the Saudi Arabia of oil. While Saudi Arabia’s share of the global crude oil production has remained reasonably constant at around 12%, the U.S. has increased from providing about 8% of the global oil supply to over 20%. Share Of Global Crude Oil Production In the past, the automatic answer was that the U.S. economy suffered a net loss when oil prices were higher. Consider that without significant domestic production, the U.S. economy was primarily seeing higher prices without benefiting from the oil price increase. With the surge in U.S. production, the increase in oil prices is likely to be neutral for the U.S. economy. This less U.S. economic harm isn’t to imply that a spike in oil prices would be an optimal situation for the economy or markets. Consider higher oil prices as a general reallocation of profits from other industries to the energy sector. This profit reallocation is not typically healthy for overall stock market performance. Economic Impact Of US Oil Production The recent release of U.S. household net worth presents a relatively optimistic picture in aggregate, with net worth only slightly below all-time highs. US Household Net Worth: 1Q 2025 While it is correct for pessimists to point to rising U.S. consumer debt levels since the pandemic lows, the ability of households to handle that debt remains at better-than-pre-pandemic levels. US Household Debt Levels Further to rising consumer debt, credit card debt has also increased, but delinquencies remain below pre-pandemic levels. Credit Card Delinquencies Overall, U.S. households are in a reasonable financial position to withstand an increase in oil prices. Much of the positive story relies on the U.S. labor market remaining resilient. There are signs, as indicated by slowing payroll job growth and rising continuing claims for unemployment benefits, that the job situation is deteriorating. As noted previously, a rise in oil prices disproportionately negatively impacts lower-income households, who are already struggling with the elevated inflation of recent years. As expected, the Federal Reserve made no change to short-term interest rates last week. The meeting continued the trend of the central bank holding steady under “elevated” uncertainty about the economic outlook. The updated median estimates from the Fed still call for two rate cuts this year. Under the surface, the forecast showed a considerable difference in opinions among members, with seven expecting no cuts in 2025 and ten forecasting two or more cuts. To underscore the lack of confidence in the outlooks, Chair Powell said, “No one holds these rate paths with a great deal of conviction.” Markets currently expect two 0.25% Fed cuts in 2025, consistent with the median Fed projection. There is little chance of a cut in July. Instead, the first move lower in 2025 is expected in September. Number Of Expected Fed Rate Cuts The betting market priced in slightly higher odds of a recession in 2025 following the beginning of the bombing of Iran. This relatively small increase in recession risk is consistent with the decline in stock prices. Notably, markets currently project a relatively low risk of a U.S. recession, which is consistent with the fundamental health of the U.S. economy and its current resilience to higher oil prices. Betting Odds Of 2025 US Recession The primary economic risk of the Israel-Iran conflict is the potential threat to oil supplies, which could lead to significantly higher oil prices. Higher oil prices are a headwind to global growth. While higher oil prices are a significant drag on many sectors within the U.S. economy, the profits from U.S. oil production provide a positive offset. Within industries, high energy prices reallocate profits from other sectors to the energy sector. Stocks within the energy sector tend to outperform when oil prices rise and underperform when they fall. S&P 500 Energy Sector Relative Performance Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has a significant allocation to energy stocks, which account for approximately 11% of the publicly traded stock portfolio, compared to a little over 3% of the S&P 500. Berkshire controls almost 27% of the outstanding shares in Occidental Petroleum (OXY), which, combined with its Chevron (CVX) position, results in a significant overweight in the energy sector. A deeper analysis of the probable reasons behind the Occidental purchase can be found here. Buffett has noted that energy investments are a bet on oil prices over the long term. Based on past geopolitical conflicts, investors should be prepared for pressure on stocks at the start of any widening conflict. While the timing is always unclear, stocks have rebounded as the uncertainty surrounding the events waned. If energy stocks aren’t already part of their diversified portfolio, investors should consider allocating some portion of their portfolio to energy stocks. The energy sector is expected to benefit from rising oil prices, providing some offset to the pressure on other industries.

REWIND and PLAY I never used Jane myself back in the day, or for that matter any 128 native word processor, and even when we got a 128 I still wrote my term papers in Pocket Writer 64 or Timeworks Word Writer. However, that faulty but repairable Australian Commodore 128DCR I got last Christmas came with a big box of software and in there was a complete copy of Jane 128 along with the data disk the previous owners' family had used. They were delighted when I said I wanted to take a whack at converting their files as a thank you — and along the way we'll take a look at Jane's oddball history, the original Apple II version, the Commodore 128 version and its all-but-unknown port to the French Thomson MO5, plus those other attempts at productivity applications Commodore tried in the mid-1980s. PETs, of course, had many productivity software options and even the VIC-20, if suitably upgraded, could manage basic tasks. Some small businesses reportedly even used them for simple finances. The 64 itself was hardly an ideal productivity machine when introduced in 1982, but it was certainly far more up to the task than the VIC-20 was and many such software packages were naturally available later on. Initially, however, dealers and customers openly groused about the absence of a spreadsheet or even a word processor, much to Commodore chief Jack Tramiel's profound displeasure. The task of rectifying this situation was handed to executive Sigmund Hartmann and his recently consolidated Commodore Software division, formed in April 1983 from the prior two separate software units handling system software (under Paul Goheen) and games (under Bill Wade). At least one side project would become critical to the reworked division. Engineer John Feagans had been the initial developer of the PET Kernal, its internal ROM-based operating system, which pioneered the then-novel idea of separating I/O and other system routines from the built-in Microsoft BASIC. (Prior versions of BASIC on early microcomputers often simply drove devices directly.) Feagans' innovation facilitated the use of these routines by user-written machine language programs through a standardized jump table, which was reused and greatly expanded by Bob Russell for the VIC-20 and 64. Feagans' side project was a PET demonstration of a small picture-based file manager, using an office filing cabinet as its central metaphor and drawn with PETSCII graphic characters. In 1982 the Commodore office in Moorpark, California where Feagans worked was closed and he was reassigned to their then-executive offices in Santa Clara. With little else to do at the time, Feagans rewrote his file cabinet demo for the new 64 to get familiar with the hardware, primarily in BASIC. As an exploration of the 64's joystick and moveable sprite capabilities, he additionally implemented an animated "hand" controlled by the joystick that served as a pointer. By this time Hartmann had just weeks until Summer CES in June 1983, the deadline he had promised Tramiel. While working on licensing deals with outside firms, Hartmann also ordered Andy Finkel, promoted from the VIC team to technical manager, to find anything the software division was already working on that could get finished fast. Finkel saw Feagans' new demo and convinced Hartmann that it was both feasible and viable as a product. Magic Desk was completed by Feagans, Finkel and other Commodore developers at record speed, recruiting resources from Rich Wiggins' speech group in Dallas, Texas and marketing and documentation head Michael Tomczyk, who in turn brought in artist and programmer Jeff Bruette to develop the sprite-based icons and additional PETSCII backgrounds. With time being a severely limited resource, after completion of the typewriter and filing cabinet it was instead decided that this Magic Desk would be the first of a whole line of Magic Desk software between which data could be exchanged. This was Magic Desk I: Type & File, and it made it to CES along with almost 70 other programs for the 64 and VIC-20. "We want everyone to know that Commodore's in the software business," Hartmann declared to COMPUTE!'s Gazette. Like many Commodore Software titles Magic Desk was released on cartridge, a wise decision as it started up within seconds, and its interface was colourful, audacious and unlike anything else at that year's CES. (At the time Feagans claimed never to have seen the Apple Lisa or Xerox PARC machines when he developed it, though his recollection later varied.) As a result it quickly overshadowed the software division's other C64 productivity titles licensed from outside companies, such as Easy Script from British developer Precision Software Ltd which débuted at the same show. When it eventually emerged for sale in the fall, however, reviewers were somewhat less enamoured. Although the user-friendly appearance was praised, RUN found the hand pointer difficult to manipulate and complained "the Help screens [were] little or no help," and Ahoy! noted the file cabinet required a disk drive and the questionable use of RELative files for storage, slowing access and hampering interchange. Reviewers also were quick to notice the icons for later planned Magic Desk modules, nevertheless already on the desktop yet programmed to do absolutely nothing. But the most unanimous and direct criticism came for what few built-in applications there were, especially the centrepiece typewriter which was seen as limited and idiosyncratic — and moreso given Magic Desk initially sold for $71.95 (in 2025 dollars over $230) at a time when other, better and often cheaper options had since become available, including from Commodore themselves. InfoWorld was the harshest of its detractors, concluding, "We really question whether Commodore's approach with Magic Desk is the best way to develop 'people literacy.'" Part of this cost was the expense of manufacture. Magic Desk initially came as 32K of ROM in four 8K chips, quite possibly the largest cartridge developed for the 64 at that time and requiring additional logic on the PCB for bank switching. (Its design is still used to this day for large multicarts, now supporting as much as a megabyte of ROM.) Internally, although some code had been converted to machine language using a custom compiler, there wasn't enough time to do it all and a fair portion of Magic Desk thus remained written in BASIC (moved up to start at $0a01 instead of $0801). As part of initialization this BASIC program is read out of the ROMs and copied to RAM for execution, which is the slight pause at the beginning before the title screen appears. Despite the cool press reception, Magic Desk sold surprisingly well to new 64 users, and in numbers sufficient to solve its production problems such that its price dropped in half by late 1984. Sales were enough to propose an upgraded version called Magic Desk II for Commodore's new (and, ultimately to its detriment, incompatible) 264 series, capable of speech prompts when paired with the speech group's Magic Voice synthesizer hardware, and featuring a more sophisticated interface with "Lisa-like" pulldown menus and icons. At the same time the software division finished the remaining pieces of the original 64 Magic Desk (now simply called "The Magic Desk"), also with speech capability; the screenshots here of the presumably completed budget and phone modules are from prototype ROMs in an auction lot of Feagans' old Commodore memorabilia, double the size of the original version. Commodore intended the upper-tier 264s to be home and small business productivity systems, designing their hardware and TED video chip to match, with the 64 remaining as their general purpose gaming and home computer. Tramiel strongly believed, as Michael Tomczyk wrote in The Home Computer Wars, that "home computers would have the power of small business computers like IBM and Apple — but would be priced like home computers, perhaps as low as under $500." Smaller versions of the 264, with their much lower part counts, could even compete in the ultra-low market segment against systems like the ZX series in the UK. As Hartmann, Tomczyk and others in the software group felt the 264 would be most meaningful with built-in software, Magic Desk II became one of several possible option ROMs representing potential machine configurations, along with others featuring different programming languages or applications like a spreadsheet or terminal program. Tramiel embraced the idea, seeing it as a car with different models "just like General Motors." At least three "flavours," aligning with the internal groups in the software division (business, home and education), were envisioned — though the concept also met swift resistance from dealers and even Commodore's own sales team who protested having to handle multiple different versions of one computer. (One possible unspoken reason is that it was already known not to be 64 compatible, and dealers were undoubtedly unhappy about taking stock space away from a financial anchor.) With time yet again a factor, for the top-end "business flavour" the software division looked for a quick potential port and found it in Trilogy, a forthcoming 64 software package from Orange County, California-based Tri Micro demonstrated at Spring Comdex 1983. Trilogy was to be a combination of three existing Tri Micro programs, Your Home Office (word processor and spreadsheet) and The Write File (word processor and database) merged into a single application, and Plus Graph (charting) — what would have been called "integrated software" in those days. Commodore contracted with David Johnson, its developer and Tri Micro's VP of software engineering, to also port it to the 264. In January 1984 Jack Tramiel was forced out of the company he founded by chairman Irving Gould and shortly thereafter the 264 line was slashed by new CEO Marshall Smith. Three models were chosen from the various prototypes and experiments, the 16K 16 (and in Europe the 116 as well) to serve as the low-end, and the 64K 264, now renamed the Plus/4, as the high-end. Both the completed Magic Desk and Magic Desk II were cut, as was the education flavour based on a built-in Logo implementation. Only the Plus/4 would offer Trilogy, renamed to 3-Plus-1, and its ROM size was cut to 32K to reduce production costs further which in turn forced Johnson to make serious reductions in functionality. As a result 3-Plus-1 became nearly as maligned as the Plus/4 itself (mocked in the press as the "Minus/60" for its idiosyncrasies, deliberately incompatible ports and lack of 64 software compatibility), though yours truly actually used the spreadsheet for a household budget when I was a starving student, and it wasn't that bad. Nevertheless, as evidence of the hasty last-minute switch, the Plus/4 manual still makes vague reference to "built-in software packages," saying the computer will tell you "which packages are available and which function key to use to activate them." There was only ever one in the production model, and it was 3+1. As Tri-Micro had still maintained the rights, Trilogy was subsequently released in its original form for the 64 as Team-Mate to the rave reviews 3-Plus-1 never got (in July 1985 RUN called it "a high-performance program that Commodore users will discover to be one of the best available"). Johnson later got his chance to show what 3+1 was really capable of with Plus/Extra, a full disk version sold by Tri Micro, but it lacked the close integration of both Team-Mate and 3+1 and ended up tainted in the market by its predecessor. Commodore never adopted it. The failure of the Plus/4 to succeed the 64, much less overtake it, demonstrated clearly to Commodore management that 64 compatibility was essential in their next computer. Around this same time Sig Hartmann had noted the success of Atari's own first-party software unit Atarisoft on non-Atari platforms (though AtariLab was developed externally), even for the 64, and said there were similar plans to port Commodore first-party software and licenses to the Apple II, IBM PC and PCjr. (NARRATOR: This didn't happen.) However, by mid-1984 the software division had also developed a reputation for poor quality, with Scott Mace commenting in InfoWorld that — hits like International Soccer notwithstanding — "so far, the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity." In the meantime, Tramiel had bought the ailing Atari from Warner Communications and lured several Commodore managers, including Hartmann (who was already in conflict with Smith over cuts to the software division), to defect. Paul Goheen, the former systems software group head, became the new software chief. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14. The left margin is (probably) at byte offset 6 because the right margin is at byte offset 8 (also a 16-bit LE short), followed by the paragraph indent. After this header, we now get the text, shown here in its entirety. 000000a0 00 20 00 49 74 20 77 61 73 20 61 20 64 61 72 6b |. .It was a dark| 000000b0 20 61 6e 64 20 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 20 6e 69 67 68 | and stormy nigh| 000000c0 74 2e 00 90 49 74 90 20 90 77 61 73 90 20 90 61 |t...It. .was. .a| 000000d0 90 20 90 64 61 72 6b 90 20 90 61 6e 64 90 20 90 |. .dark. .and. .| 000000e0 75 6e 64 65 72 6c 69 6e 65 64 90 20 90 73 74 6f |underlined. .sto| 000000f0 72 6d 79 90 20 90 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 88 49 74 |rmy. .night...It| 00000100 88 20 88 77 61 73 88 20 88 61 88 20 88 64 61 72 |. .was. .a. .dar| 00000110 6b 88 20 88 61 6e 64 88 20 88 62 6f 6c 64 88 20 |k. .and. .bold. | 00000120 88 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 88 20 88 6e 69 67 68 74 2e |.stormy. .night.| 00000130 00 98 49 74 98 20 98 77 61 73 98 20 98 61 98 20 |..It. .was. .a. | 00000140 98 64 61 72 6b 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 62 6f |.dark. .and. .bo| 00000150 6c 64 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 75 6e 64 65 72 |ld. .and. .under| 00000160 6c 69 6e 65 64 98 20 98 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 98 20 |lined. .stormy. | 00000170 98 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 00 a0 49 74 a0 20 a0 77 |.night....It. .w| 00000180 61 73 a0 20 a0 61 6c 73 6f a0 20 a0 73 75 70 65 |as. .also. .supe| 00000190 72 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 a0 20 20 c0 61 6e 64 |rscripted. .and| 000001a0 c0 20 c0 73 75 62 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 2e c0 |. .subscripted..| 000001b0 20 20 2e 2e 2e 20 62 75 74 20 6e 6f 74 20 62 6f | ... but not bo| 000001c0 74 68 2c 00 61 6e 64 20 6e 6f 74 20 63 6f 6d 62 |th,.and not comb| 000001d0 69 6e 65 64 20 77 69 74 68 20 75 6e 64 65 72 6c |ined with underl| 000001e0 69 6e 69 6e 67 20 6f 72 20 62 6f 6c 64 2e 00 00 |ining or bold...| 000001f0 48 65 20 6c 65 66 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 |He left justifie| 00000200 64 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 58 48 65 20 |d himself...XHe | 00000210 72 69 67 68 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 64 20 |right justified | 00000220 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 24 48 65 20 70 75 |himself...$He pu| 00000230 74 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 20 72 69 67 68 74 20 |t himself right | 00000240 69 6e 20 74 68 65 20 63 65 6e 74 72 65 2e 00 ff |in the centre...| 00000250 0a 48 65 20 6d 61 64 65 20 65 76 65 72 79 74 68 |.He made everyth| 00000260 69 6e 67 20 65 78 70 61 6e 64 20 6f 75 74 2c 20 |ing expand out, | 00000270 61 20 70 61 72 61 67 72 61 70 68 20 65 78 74 65 |a paragraph exte| 00000280 6e 64 69 6e 67 20 6f 76 65 72 20 6d 75 6c 74 69 |nding over multi| 00000290 70 6c 65 00 ff 0a 6c 69 6e 65 73 2c 20 61 20 66 |ple...lines, a f| 000002a0 72 61 67 6d 65 6e 74 20 74 68 61 74 20 62 65 63 |ragment that bec| 000002b0 61 6d 65 20 61 6e 20 69 63 6f 6e 20 75 6e 74 6f |ame an icon unto| 000002c0 20 69 74 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 00 61 82 61 86 61 87 | itself...a.a.a.| 000002d0 61 82 61 81 20 61 6e 64 20 6e 65 78 74 20 41 82 |a.a. and next A.| 000002e0 41 86 41 87 41 82 41 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 6e 82 |A.A.A.A. next n.| 000002f0 6e 86 6e 87 6e 82 6e 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 4e 82 |n.n.n.n. next N.| 00000300 4e 86 4e 87 4e 82 4e 81 20 6d 61 81 6e 81 61 6e |N.N.N.N. ma.n.an| 00000310 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 |a abr.e. al.o. a| 00000320 6c 84 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |l.e.............| 00000330 00 00 00 00 00 00 |......| Most of the document again can be trivially understood as null-delimited strings. Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. At least one side project would become critical to the reworked division. Engineer John Feagans had been the initial developer of the PET Kernal, its internal ROM-based operating system, which pioneered the then-novel idea of separating I/O and other system routines from the built-in Microsoft BASIC. (Prior versions of BASIC on early microcomputers often simply drove devices directly.) Feagans' innovation facilitated the use of these routines by user-written machine language programs through a standardized jump table, which was reused and greatly expanded by Bob Russell for the VIC-20 and 64. Feagans' side project was a PET demonstration of a small picture-based file manager, using an office filing cabinet as its central metaphor and drawn with PETSCII graphic characters. In 1982 the Commodore office in Moorpark, California where Feagans worked was closed and he was reassigned to their then-executive offices in Santa Clara. With little else to do at the time, Feagans rewrote his file cabinet demo for the new 64 to get familiar with the hardware, primarily in BASIC. As an exploration of the 64's joystick and moveable sprite capabilities, he additionally implemented an animated "hand" controlled by the joystick that served as a pointer. By this time Hartmann had just weeks until Summer CES in June 1983, the deadline he had promised Tramiel. While working on licensing deals with outside firms, Hartmann also ordered Andy Finkel, promoted from the VIC team to technical manager, to find anything the software division was already working on that could get finished fast. Finkel saw Feagans' new demo and convinced Hartmann that it was both feasible and viable as a product. Magic Desk was completed by Feagans, Finkel and other Commodore developers at record speed, recruiting resources from Rich Wiggins' speech group in Dallas, Texas and marketing and documentation head Michael Tomczyk, who in turn brought in artist and programmer Jeff Bruette to develop the sprite-based icons and additional PETSCII backgrounds. With time being a severely limited resource, after completion of the typewriter and filing cabinet it was instead decided that this Magic Desk would be the first of a whole line of Magic Desk software between which data could be exchanged. This was Magic Desk I: Type & File, and it made it to CES along with almost 70 other programs for the 64 and VIC-20. "We want everyone to know that Commodore's in the software business," Hartmann declared to COMPUTE!'s Gazette. Like many Commodore Software titles Magic Desk was released on cartridge, a wise decision as it started up within seconds, and its interface was colourful, audacious and unlike anything else at that year's CES. (At the time Feagans claimed never to have seen the Apple Lisa or Xerox PARC machines when he developed it, though his recollection later varied.) As a result it quickly overshadowed the software division's other C64 productivity titles licensed from outside companies, such as Easy Script from British developer Precision Software Ltd which débuted at the same show. When it eventually emerged for sale in the fall, however, reviewers were somewhat less enamoured. Although the user-friendly appearance was praised, RUN found the hand pointer difficult to manipulate and complained "the Help screens [were] little or no help," and Ahoy! noted the file cabinet required a disk drive and the questionable use of RELative files for storage, slowing access and hampering interchange. Reviewers also were quick to notice the icons for later planned Magic Desk modules, nevertheless already on the desktop yet programmed to do absolutely nothing. But the most unanimous and direct criticism came for what few built-in applications there were, especially the centrepiece typewriter which was seen as limited and idiosyncratic — and moreso given Magic Desk initially sold for $71.95 (in 2025 dollars over $230) at a time when other, better and often cheaper options had since become available, including from Commodore themselves. InfoWorld was the harshest of its detractors, concluding, "We really question whether Commodore's approach with Magic Desk is the best way to develop 'people literacy.'" Part of this cost was the expense of manufacture. Magic Desk initially came as 32K of ROM in four 8K chips, quite possibly the largest cartridge developed for the 64 at that time and requiring additional logic on the PCB for bank switching. (Its design is still used to this day for large multicarts, now supporting as much as a megabyte of ROM.) Internally, although some code had been converted to machine language using a custom compiler, there wasn't enough time to do it all and a fair portion of Magic Desk thus remained written in BASIC (moved up to start at $0a01 instead of $0801). As part of initialization this BASIC program is read out of the ROMs and copied to RAM for execution, which is the slight pause at the beginning before the title screen appears. Despite the cool press reception, Magic Desk sold surprisingly well to new 64 users, and in numbers sufficient to solve its production problems such that its price dropped in half by late 1984. Sales were enough to propose an upgraded version called Magic Desk II for Commodore's new (and, ultimately to its detriment, incompatible) 264 series, capable of speech prompts when paired with the speech group's Magic Voice synthesizer hardware, and featuring a more sophisticated interface with "Lisa-like" pulldown menus and icons. At the same time the software division finished the remaining pieces of the original 64 Magic Desk (now simply called "The Magic Desk"), also with speech capability; the screenshots here of the presumably completed budget and phone modules are from prototype ROMs in an auction lot of Feagans' old Commodore memorabilia, double the size of the original version. Commodore intended the upper-tier 264s to be home and small business productivity systems, designing their hardware and TED video chip to match, with the 64 remaining as their general purpose gaming and home computer. Tramiel strongly believed, as Michael Tomczyk wrote in The Home Computer Wars, that "home computers would have the power of small business computers like IBM and Apple — but would be priced like home computers, perhaps as low as under $500." Smaller versions of the 264, with their much lower part counts, could even compete in the ultra-low market segment against systems like the ZX series in the UK. As Hartmann, Tomczyk and others in the software group felt the 264 would be most meaningful with built-in software, Magic Desk II became one of several possible option ROMs representing potential machine configurations, along with others featuring different programming languages or applications like a spreadsheet or terminal program. Tramiel embraced the idea, seeing it as a car with different models "just like General Motors." At least three "flavours," aligning with the internal groups in the software division (business, home and education), were envisioned — though the concept also met swift resistance from dealers and even Commodore's own sales team who protested having to handle multiple different versions of one computer. (One possible unspoken reason is that it was already known not to be 64 compatible, and dealers were undoubtedly unhappy about taking stock space away from a financial anchor.) With time yet again a factor, for the top-end "business flavour" the software division looked for a quick potential port and found it in Trilogy, a forthcoming 64 software package from Orange County, California-based Tri Micro demonstrated at Spring Comdex 1983. Trilogy was to be a combination of three existing Tri Micro programs, Your Home Office (word processor and spreadsheet) and The Write File (word processor and database) merged into a single application, and Plus Graph (charting) — what would have been called "integrated software" in those days. Commodore contracted with David Johnson, its developer and Tri Micro's VP of software engineering, to also port it to the 264. In January 1984 Jack Tramiel was forced out of the company he founded by chairman Irving Gould and shortly thereafter the 264 line was slashed by new CEO Marshall Smith. Three models were chosen from the various prototypes and experiments, the 16K 16 (and in Europe the 116 as well) to serve as the low-end, and the 64K 264, now renamed the Plus/4, as the high-end. Both the completed Magic Desk and Magic Desk II were cut, as was the education flavour based on a built-in Logo implementation. Only the Plus/4 would offer Trilogy, renamed to 3-Plus-1, and its ROM size was cut to 32K to reduce production costs further which in turn forced Johnson to make serious reductions in functionality. As a result 3-Plus-1 became nearly as maligned as the Plus/4 itself (mocked in the press as the "Minus/60" for its idiosyncrasies, deliberately incompatible ports and lack of 64 software compatibility), though yours truly actually used the spreadsheet for a household budget when I was a starving student, and it wasn't that bad. Nevertheless, as evidence of the hasty last-minute switch, the Plus/4 manual still makes vague reference to "built-in software packages," saying the computer will tell you "which packages are available and which function key to use to activate them." There was only ever one in the production model, and it was 3+1. As Tri-Micro had still maintained the rights, Trilogy was subsequently released in its original form for the 64 as Team-Mate to the rave reviews 3-Plus-1 never got (in July 1985 RUN called it "a high-performance program that Commodore users will discover to be one of the best available"). Johnson later got his chance to show what 3+1 was really capable of with Plus/Extra, a full disk version sold by Tri Micro, but it lacked the close integration of both Team-Mate and 3+1 and ended up tainted in the market by its predecessor. Commodore never adopted it. The failure of the Plus/4 to succeed the 64, much less overtake it, demonstrated clearly to Commodore management that 64 compatibility was essential in their next computer. Around this same time Sig Hartmann had noted the success of Atari's own first-party software unit Atarisoft on non-Atari platforms (though AtariLab was developed externally), even for the 64, and said there were similar plans to port Commodore first-party software and licenses to the Apple II, IBM PC and PCjr. (NARRATOR: This didn't happen.) However, by mid-1984 the software division had also developed a reputation for poor quality, with Scott Mace commenting in InfoWorld that — hits like International Soccer notwithstanding — "so far, the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity." In the meantime, Tramiel had bought the ailing Atari from Warner Communications and lured several Commodore managers, including Hartmann (who was already in conflict with Smith over cuts to the software division), to defect. Paul Goheen, the former systems software group head, became the new software chief. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Feagans' side project was a PET demonstration of a small picture-based file manager, using an office filing cabinet as its central metaphor and drawn with PETSCII graphic characters. In 1982 the Commodore office in Moorpark, California where Feagans worked was closed and he was reassigned to their then-executive offices in Santa Clara. With little else to do at the time, Feagans rewrote his file cabinet demo for the new 64 to get familiar with the hardware, primarily in BASIC. As an exploration of the 64's joystick and moveable sprite capabilities, he additionally implemented an animated "hand" controlled by the joystick that served as a pointer. By this time Hartmann had just weeks until Summer CES in June 1983, the deadline he had promised Tramiel. While working on licensing deals with outside firms, Hartmann also ordered Andy Finkel, promoted from the VIC team to technical manager, to find anything the software division was already working on that could get finished fast. Finkel saw Feagans' new demo and convinced Hartmann that it was both feasible and viable as a product. Magic Desk was completed by Feagans, Finkel and other Commodore developers at record speed, recruiting resources from Rich Wiggins' speech group in Dallas, Texas and marketing and documentation head Michael Tomczyk, who in turn brought in artist and programmer Jeff Bruette to develop the sprite-based icons and additional PETSCII backgrounds. With time being a severely limited resource, after completion of the typewriter and filing cabinet it was instead decided that this Magic Desk would be the first of a whole line of Magic Desk software between which data could be exchanged. This was Magic Desk I: Type & File, and it made it to CES along with almost 70 other programs for the 64 and VIC-20. "We want everyone to know that Commodore's in the software business," Hartmann declared to COMPUTE!'s Gazette. Like many Commodore Software titles Magic Desk was released on cartridge, a wise decision as it started up within seconds, and its interface was colourful, audacious and unlike anything else at that year's CES. (At the time Feagans claimed never to have seen the Apple Lisa or Xerox PARC machines when he developed it, though his recollection later varied.) As a result it quickly overshadowed the software division's other C64 productivity titles licensed from outside companies, such as Easy Script from British developer Precision Software Ltd which débuted at the same show. When it eventually emerged for sale in the fall, however, reviewers were somewhat less enamoured. Although the user-friendly appearance was praised, RUN found the hand pointer difficult to manipulate and complained "the Help screens [were] little or no help," and Ahoy! noted the file cabinet required a disk drive and the questionable use of RELative files for storage, slowing access and hampering interchange. Reviewers also were quick to notice the icons for later planned Magic Desk modules, nevertheless already on the desktop yet programmed to do absolutely nothing. But the most unanimous and direct criticism came for what few built-in applications there were, especially the centrepiece typewriter which was seen as limited and idiosyncratic — and moreso given Magic Desk initially sold for $71.95 (in 2025 dollars over $230) at a time when other, better and often cheaper options had since become available, including from Commodore themselves. InfoWorld was the harshest of its detractors, concluding, "We really question whether Commodore's approach with Magic Desk is the best way to develop 'people literacy.'" Part of this cost was the expense of manufacture. Magic Desk initially came as 32K of ROM in four 8K chips, quite possibly the largest cartridge developed for the 64 at that time and requiring additional logic on the PCB for bank switching. (Its design is still used to this day for large multicarts, now supporting as much as a megabyte of ROM.) Internally, although some code had been converted to machine language using a custom compiler, there wasn't enough time to do it all and a fair portion of Magic Desk thus remained written in BASIC (moved up to start at $0a01 instead of $0801). As part of initialization this BASIC program is read out of the ROMs and copied to RAM for execution, which is the slight pause at the beginning before the title screen appears. Despite the cool press reception, Magic Desk sold surprisingly well to new 64 users, and in numbers sufficient to solve its production problems such that its price dropped in half by late 1984. Sales were enough to propose an upgraded version called Magic Desk II for Commodore's new (and, ultimately to its detriment, incompatible) 264 series, capable of speech prompts when paired with the speech group's Magic Voice synthesizer hardware, and featuring a more sophisticated interface with "Lisa-like" pulldown menus and icons. At the same time the software division finished the remaining pieces of the original 64 Magic Desk (now simply called "The Magic Desk"), also with speech capability; the screenshots here of the presumably completed budget and phone modules are from prototype ROMs in an auction lot of Feagans' old Commodore memorabilia, double the size of the original version. Commodore intended the upper-tier 264s to be home and small business productivity systems, designing their hardware and TED video chip to match, with the 64 remaining as their general purpose gaming and home computer. Tramiel strongly believed, as Michael Tomczyk wrote in The Home Computer Wars, that "home computers would have the power of small business computers like IBM and Apple — but would be priced like home computers, perhaps as low as under $500." Smaller versions of the 264, with their much lower part counts, could even compete in the ultra-low market segment against systems like the ZX series in the UK. As Hartmann, Tomczyk and others in the software group felt the 264 would be most meaningful with built-in software, Magic Desk II became one of several possible option ROMs representing potential machine configurations, along with others featuring different programming languages or applications like a spreadsheet or terminal program. Tramiel embraced the idea, seeing it as a car with different models "just like General Motors." At least three "flavours," aligning with the internal groups in the software division (business, home and education), were envisioned — though the concept also met swift resistance from dealers and even Commodore's own sales team who protested having to handle multiple different versions of one computer. (One possible unspoken reason is that it was already known not to be 64 compatible, and dealers were undoubtedly unhappy about taking stock space away from a financial anchor.) With time yet again a factor, for the top-end "business flavour" the software division looked for a quick potential port and found it in Trilogy, a forthcoming 64 software package from Orange County, California-based Tri Micro demonstrated at Spring Comdex 1983. Trilogy was to be a combination of three existing Tri Micro programs, Your Home Office (word processor and spreadsheet) and The Write File (word processor and database) merged into a single application, and Plus Graph (charting) — what would have been called "integrated software" in those days. Commodore contracted with David Johnson, its developer and Tri Micro's VP of software engineering, to also port it to the 264. In January 1984 Jack Tramiel was forced out of the company he founded by chairman Irving Gould and shortly thereafter the 264 line was slashed by new CEO Marshall Smith. Three models were chosen from the various prototypes and experiments, the 16K 16 (and in Europe the 116 as well) to serve as the low-end, and the 64K 264, now renamed the Plus/4, as the high-end. Both the completed Magic Desk and Magic Desk II were cut, as was the education flavour based on a built-in Logo implementation. Only the Plus/4 would offer Trilogy, renamed to 3-Plus-1, and its ROM size was cut to 32K to reduce production costs further which in turn forced Johnson to make serious reductions in functionality. As a result 3-Plus-1 became nearly as maligned as the Plus/4 itself (mocked in the press as the "Minus/60" for its idiosyncrasies, deliberately incompatible ports and lack of 64 software compatibility), though yours truly actually used the spreadsheet for a household budget when I was a starving student, and it wasn't that bad. Nevertheless, as evidence of the hasty last-minute switch, the Plus/4 manual still makes vague reference to "built-in software packages," saying the computer will tell you "which packages are available and which function key to use to activate them." There was only ever one in the production model, and it was 3+1. As Tri-Micro had still maintained the rights, Trilogy was subsequently released in its original form for the 64 as Team-Mate to the rave reviews 3-Plus-1 never got (in July 1985 RUN called it "a high-performance program that Commodore users will discover to be one of the best available"). Johnson later got his chance to show what 3+1 was really capable of with Plus/Extra, a full disk version sold by Tri Micro, but it lacked the close integration of both Team-Mate and 3+1 and ended up tainted in the market by its predecessor. Commodore never adopted it. The failure of the Plus/4 to succeed the 64, much less overtake it, demonstrated clearly to Commodore management that 64 compatibility was essential in their next computer. Around this same time Sig Hartmann had noted the success of Atari's own first-party software unit Atarisoft on non-Atari platforms (though AtariLab was developed externally), even for the 64, and said there were similar plans to port Commodore first-party software and licenses to the Apple II, IBM PC and PCjr. (NARRATOR: This didn't happen.) However, by mid-1984 the software division had also developed a reputation for poor quality, with Scott Mace commenting in InfoWorld that — hits like International Soccer notwithstanding — "so far, the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity." In the meantime, Tramiel had bought the ailing Atari from Warner Communications and lured several Commodore managers, including Hartmann (who was already in conflict with Smith over cuts to the software division), to defect. Paul Goheen, the former systems software group head, became the new software chief. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Part of this cost was the expense of manufacture. Magic Desk initially came as 32K of ROM in four 8K chips, quite possibly the largest cartridge developed for the 64 at that time and requiring additional logic on the PCB for bank switching. (Its design is still used to this day for large multicarts, now supporting as much as a megabyte of ROM.) Internally, although some code had been converted to machine language using a custom compiler, there wasn't enough time to do it all and a fair portion of Magic Desk thus remained written in BASIC (moved up to start at $0a01 instead of $0801). As part of initialization this BASIC program is read out of the ROMs and copied to RAM for execution, which is the slight pause at the beginning before the title screen appears. Despite the cool press reception, Magic Desk sold surprisingly well to new 64 users, and in numbers sufficient to solve its production problems such that its price dropped in half by late 1984. Sales were enough to propose an upgraded version called Magic Desk II for Commodore's new (and, ultimately to its detriment, incompatible) 264 series, capable of speech prompts when paired with the speech group's Magic Voice synthesizer hardware, and featuring a more sophisticated interface with "Lisa-like" pulldown menus and icons. At the same time the software division finished the remaining pieces of the original 64 Magic Desk (now simply called "The Magic Desk"), also with speech capability; the screenshots here of the presumably completed budget and phone modules are from prototype ROMs in an auction lot of Feagans' old Commodore memorabilia, double the size of the original version. Commodore intended the upper-tier 264s to be home and small business productivity systems, designing their hardware and TED video chip to match, with the 64 remaining as their general purpose gaming and home computer. Tramiel strongly believed, as Michael Tomczyk wrote in The Home Computer Wars, that "home computers would have the power of small business computers like IBM and Apple — but would be priced like home computers, perhaps as low as under $500." Smaller versions of the 264, with their much lower part counts, could even compete in the ultra-low market segment against systems like the ZX series in the UK. As Hartmann, Tomczyk and others in the software group felt the 264 would be most meaningful with built-in software, Magic Desk II became one of several possible option ROMs representing potential machine configurations, along with others featuring different programming languages or applications like a spreadsheet or terminal program. Tramiel embraced the idea, seeing it as a car with different models "just like General Motors." At least three "flavours," aligning with the internal groups in the software division (business, home and education), were envisioned — though the concept also met swift resistance from dealers and even Commodore's own sales team who protested having to handle multiple different versions of one computer. (One possible unspoken reason is that it was already known not to be 64 compatible, and dealers were undoubtedly unhappy about taking stock space away from a financial anchor.) With time yet again a factor, for the top-end "business flavour" the software division looked for a quick potential port and found it in Trilogy, a forthcoming 64 software package from Orange County, California-based Tri Micro demonstrated at Spring Comdex 1983. Trilogy was to be a combination of three existing Tri Micro programs, Your Home Office (word processor and spreadsheet) and The Write File (word processor and database) merged into a single application, and Plus Graph (charting) — what would have been called "integrated software" in those days. Commodore contracted with David Johnson, its developer and Tri Micro's VP of software engineering, to also port it to the 264. In January 1984 Jack Tramiel was forced out of the company he founded by chairman Irving Gould and shortly thereafter the 264 line was slashed by new CEO Marshall Smith. Three models were chosen from the various prototypes and experiments, the 16K 16 (and in Europe the 116 as well) to serve as the low-end, and the 64K 264, now renamed the Plus/4, as the high-end. Both the completed Magic Desk and Magic Desk II were cut, as was the education flavour based on a built-in Logo implementation. Only the Plus/4 would offer Trilogy, renamed to 3-Plus-1, and its ROM size was cut to 32K to reduce production costs further which in turn forced Johnson to make serious reductions in functionality. As a result 3-Plus-1 became nearly as maligned as the Plus/4 itself (mocked in the press as the "Minus/60" for its idiosyncrasies, deliberately incompatible ports and lack of 64 software compatibility), though yours truly actually used the spreadsheet for a household budget when I was a starving student, and it wasn't that bad. Nevertheless, as evidence of the hasty last-minute switch, the Plus/4 manual still makes vague reference to "built-in software packages," saying the computer will tell you "which packages are available and which function key to use to activate them." There was only ever one in the production model, and it was 3+1. As Tri-Micro had still maintained the rights, Trilogy was subsequently released in its original form for the 64 as Team-Mate to the rave reviews 3-Plus-1 never got (in July 1985 RUN called it "a high-performance program that Commodore users will discover to be one of the best available"). Johnson later got his chance to show what 3+1 was really capable of with Plus/Extra, a full disk version sold by Tri Micro, but it lacked the close integration of both Team-Mate and 3+1 and ended up tainted in the market by its predecessor. Commodore never adopted it. The failure of the Plus/4 to succeed the 64, much less overtake it, demonstrated clearly to Commodore management that 64 compatibility was essential in their next computer. Around this same time Sig Hartmann had noted the success of Atari's own first-party software unit Atarisoft on non-Atari platforms (though AtariLab was developed externally), even for the 64, and said there were similar plans to port Commodore first-party software and licenses to the Apple II, IBM PC and PCjr. (NARRATOR: This didn't happen.) However, by mid-1984 the software division had also developed a reputation for poor quality, with Scott Mace commenting in InfoWorld that — hits like International Soccer notwithstanding — "so far, the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity." In the meantime, Tramiel had bought the ailing Atari from Warner Communications and lured several Commodore managers, including Hartmann (who was already in conflict with Smith over cuts to the software division), to defect. Paul Goheen, the former systems software group head, became the new software chief. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Despite the cool press reception, Magic Desk sold surprisingly well to new 64 users, and in numbers sufficient to solve its production problems such that its price dropped in half by late 1984. Sales were enough to propose an upgraded version called Magic Desk II for Commodore's new (and, ultimately to its detriment, incompatible) 264 series, capable of speech prompts when paired with the speech group's Magic Voice synthesizer hardware, and featuring a more sophisticated interface with "Lisa-like" pulldown menus and icons. At the same time the software division finished the remaining pieces of the original 64 Magic Desk (now simply called "The Magic Desk"), also with speech capability; the screenshots here of the presumably completed budget and phone modules are from prototype ROMs in an auction lot of Feagans' old Commodore memorabilia, double the size of the original version. Commodore intended the upper-tier 264s to be home and small business productivity systems, designing their hardware and TED video chip to match, with the 64 remaining as their general purpose gaming and home computer. Tramiel strongly believed, as Michael Tomczyk wrote in The Home Computer Wars, that "home computers would have the power of small business computers like IBM and Apple — but would be priced like home computers, perhaps as low as under $500." Smaller versions of the 264, with their much lower part counts, could even compete in the ultra-low market segment against systems like the ZX series in the UK. As Hartmann, Tomczyk and others in the software group felt the 264 would be most meaningful with built-in software, Magic Desk II became one of several possible option ROMs representing potential machine configurations, along with others featuring different programming languages or applications like a spreadsheet or terminal program. Tramiel embraced the idea, seeing it as a car with different models "just like General Motors." At least three "flavours," aligning with the internal groups in the software division (business, home and education), were envisioned — though the concept also met swift resistance from dealers and even Commodore's own sales team who protested having to handle multiple different versions of one computer. (One possible unspoken reason is that it was already known not to be 64 compatible, and dealers were undoubtedly unhappy about taking stock space away from a financial anchor.) With time yet again a factor, for the top-end "business flavour" the software division looked for a quick potential port and found it in Trilogy, a forthcoming 64 software package from Orange County, California-based Tri Micro demonstrated at Spring Comdex 1983. Trilogy was to be a combination of three existing Tri Micro programs, Your Home Office (word processor and spreadsheet) and The Write File (word processor and database) merged into a single application, and Plus Graph (charting) — what would have been called "integrated software" in those days. Commodore contracted with David Johnson, its developer and Tri Micro's VP of software engineering, to also port it to the 264. In January 1984 Jack Tramiel was forced out of the company he founded by chairman Irving Gould and shortly thereafter the 264 line was slashed by new CEO Marshall Smith. Three models were chosen from the various prototypes and experiments, the 16K 16 (and in Europe the 116 as well) to serve as the low-end, and the 64K 264, now renamed the Plus/4, as the high-end. Both the completed Magic Desk and Magic Desk II were cut, as was the education flavour based on a built-in Logo implementation. Only the Plus/4 would offer Trilogy, renamed to 3-Plus-1, and its ROM size was cut to 32K to reduce production costs further which in turn forced Johnson to make serious reductions in functionality. As a result 3-Plus-1 became nearly as maligned as the Plus/4 itself (mocked in the press as the "Minus/60" for its idiosyncrasies, deliberately incompatible ports and lack of 64 software compatibility), though yours truly actually used the spreadsheet for a household budget when I was a starving student, and it wasn't that bad. Nevertheless, as evidence of the hasty last-minute switch, the Plus/4 manual still makes vague reference to "built-in software packages," saying the computer will tell you "which packages are available and which function key to use to activate them." There was only ever one in the production model, and it was 3+1. As Tri-Micro had still maintained the rights, Trilogy was subsequently released in its original form for the 64 as Team-Mate to the rave reviews 3-Plus-1 never got (in July 1985 RUN called it "a high-performance program that Commodore users will discover to be one of the best available"). Johnson later got his chance to show what 3+1 was really capable of with Plus/Extra, a full disk version sold by Tri Micro, but it lacked the close integration of both Team-Mate and 3+1 and ended up tainted in the market by its predecessor. Commodore never adopted it. The failure of the Plus/4 to succeed the 64, much less overtake it, demonstrated clearly to Commodore management that 64 compatibility was essential in their next computer. Around this same time Sig Hartmann had noted the success of Atari's own first-party software unit Atarisoft on non-Atari platforms (though AtariLab was developed externally), even for the 64, and said there were similar plans to port Commodore first-party software and licenses to the Apple II, IBM PC and PCjr. (NARRATOR: This didn't happen.) However, by mid-1984 the software division had also developed a reputation for poor quality, with Scott Mace commenting in InfoWorld that — hits like International Soccer notwithstanding — "so far, the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity." In the meantime, Tramiel had bought the ailing Atari from Warner Communications and lured several Commodore managers, including Hartmann (who was already in conflict with Smith over cuts to the software division), to defect. Paul Goheen, the former systems software group head, became the new software chief. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. As Hartmann, Tomczyk and others in the software group felt the 264 would be most meaningful with built-in software, Magic Desk II became one of several possible option ROMs representing potential machine configurations, along with others featuring different programming languages or applications like a spreadsheet or terminal program. Tramiel embraced the idea, seeing it as a car with different models "just like General Motors." At least three "flavours," aligning with the internal groups in the software division (business, home and education), were envisioned — though the concept also met swift resistance from dealers and even Commodore's own sales team who protested having to handle multiple different versions of one computer. (One possible unspoken reason is that it was already known not to be 64 compatible, and dealers were undoubtedly unhappy about taking stock space away from a financial anchor.) With time yet again a factor, for the top-end "business flavour" the software division looked for a quick potential port and found it in Trilogy, a forthcoming 64 software package from Orange County, California-based Tri Micro demonstrated at Spring Comdex 1983. Trilogy was to be a combination of three existing Tri Micro programs, Your Home Office (word processor and spreadsheet) and The Write File (word processor and database) merged into a single application, and Plus Graph (charting) — what would have been called "integrated software" in those days. Commodore contracted with David Johnson, its developer and Tri Micro's VP of software engineering, to also port it to the 264. In January 1984 Jack Tramiel was forced out of the company he founded by chairman Irving Gould and shortly thereafter the 264 line was slashed by new CEO Marshall Smith. Three models were chosen from the various prototypes and experiments, the 16K 16 (and in Europe the 116 as well) to serve as the low-end, and the 64K 264, now renamed the Plus/4, as the high-end. Both the completed Magic Desk and Magic Desk II were cut, as was the education flavour based on a built-in Logo implementation. Only the Plus/4 would offer Trilogy, renamed to 3-Plus-1, and its ROM size was cut to 32K to reduce production costs further which in turn forced Johnson to make serious reductions in functionality. As a result 3-Plus-1 became nearly as maligned as the Plus/4 itself (mocked in the press as the "Minus/60" for its idiosyncrasies, deliberately incompatible ports and lack of 64 software compatibility), though yours truly actually used the spreadsheet for a household budget when I was a starving student, and it wasn't that bad. Nevertheless, as evidence of the hasty last-minute switch, the Plus/4 manual still makes vague reference to "built-in software packages," saying the computer will tell you "which packages are available and which function key to use to activate them." There was only ever one in the production model, and it was 3+1. As Tri-Micro had still maintained the rights, Trilogy was subsequently released in its original form for the 64 as Team-Mate to the rave reviews 3-Plus-1 never got (in July 1985 RUN called it "a high-performance program that Commodore users will discover to be one of the best available"). Johnson later got his chance to show what 3+1 was really capable of with Plus/Extra, a full disk version sold by Tri Micro, but it lacked the close integration of both Team-Mate and 3+1 and ended up tainted in the market by its predecessor. Commodore never adopted it. The failure of the Plus/4 to succeed the 64, much less overtake it, demonstrated clearly to Commodore management that 64 compatibility was essential in their next computer. Around this same time Sig Hartmann had noted the success of Atari's own first-party software unit Atarisoft on non-Atari platforms (though AtariLab was developed externally), even for the 64, and said there were similar plans to port Commodore first-party software and licenses to the Apple II, IBM PC and PCjr. (NARRATOR: This didn't happen.) However, by mid-1984 the software division had also developed a reputation for poor quality, with Scott Mace commenting in InfoWorld that — hits like International Soccer notwithstanding — "so far, the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity." In the meantime, Tramiel had bought the ailing Atari from Warner Communications and lured several Commodore managers, including Hartmann (who was already in conflict with Smith over cuts to the software division), to defect. Paul Goheen, the former systems software group head, became the new software chief. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

The left margin is (probably) at byte offset 6 because the right margin is at byte offset 8 (also a 16-bit LE short), followed by the paragraph indent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. In January 1984 Jack Tramiel was forced out of the company he founded by chairman Irving Gould and shortly thereafter the 264 line was slashed by new CEO Marshall Smith. Three models were chosen from the various prototypes and experiments, the 16K 16 (and in Europe the 116 as well) to serve as the low-end, and the 64K 264, now renamed the Plus/4, as the high-end. Both the completed Magic Desk and Magic Desk II were cut, as was the education flavour based on a built-in Logo implementation. Only the Plus/4 would offer Trilogy, renamed to 3-Plus-1, and its ROM size was cut to 32K to reduce production costs further which in turn forced Johnson to make serious reductions in functionality. As a result 3-Plus-1 became nearly as maligned as the Plus/4 itself (mocked in the press as the "Minus/60" for its idiosyncrasies, deliberately incompatible ports and lack of 64 software compatibility), though yours truly actually used the spreadsheet for a household budget when I was a starving student, and it wasn't that bad. Nevertheless, as evidence of the hasty last-minute switch, the Plus/4 manual still makes vague reference to "built-in software packages," saying the computer will tell you "which packages are available and which function key to use to activate them." There was only ever one in the production model, and it was 3+1. As Tri-Micro had still maintained the rights, Trilogy was subsequently released in its original form for the 64 as Team-Mate to the rave reviews 3-Plus-1 never got (in July 1985 RUN called it "a high-performance program that Commodore users will discover to be one of the best available"). Johnson later got his chance to show what 3+1 was really capable of with Plus/Extra, a full disk version sold by Tri Micro, but it lacked the close integration of both Team-Mate and 3+1 and ended up tainted in the market by its predecessor. Commodore never adopted it. The failure of the Plus/4 to succeed the 64, much less overtake it, demonstrated clearly to Commodore management that 64 compatibility was essential in their next computer. Around this same time Sig Hartmann had noted the success of Atari's own first-party software unit Atarisoft on non-Atari platforms (though AtariLab was developed externally), even for the 64, and said there were similar plans to port Commodore first-party software and licenses to the Apple II, IBM PC and PCjr. (NARRATOR: This didn't happen.) However, by mid-1984 the software division had also developed a reputation for poor quality, with Scott Mace commenting in InfoWorld that — hits like International Soccer notwithstanding — "so far, the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity." In the meantime, Tramiel had bought the ailing Atari from Warner Communications and lured several Commodore managers, including Hartmann (who was already in conflict with Smith over cuts to the software division), to defect. Paul Goheen, the former systems software group head, became the new software chief. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14. The left margin is (probably) at byte offset 6 because the right margin is at byte offset 8 (also a 16-bit LE short), followed by the paragraph indent. After this header, we now get the text, shown here in its entirety. 000000a0 00 20 00 49 74 20 77 61 73 20 61 20 64 61 72 6b |. .It was a dark| 000000b0 20 61 6e 64 20 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 20 6e 69 67 68 | and stormy nigh| 000000c0 74 2e 00 90 49 74 90 20 90 77 61 73 90 20 90 61 |t...It. .was. .a| 000000d0 90 20 90 64 61 72 6b 90 20 90 61 6e 64 90 20 90 |. .dark. .and. .| 000000e0 75 6e 64 65 72 6c 69 6e 65 64 90 20 90 73 74 6f |underlined. .sto| 000000f0 72 6d 79 90 20 90 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 88 49 74 |rmy. .night...It| 00000100 88 20 88 77 61 73 88 20 88 61 88 20 88 64 61 72 |. .was. .a. .dar| 00000110 6b 88 20 88 61 6e 64 88 20 88 62 6f 6c 64 88 20 |k. .and. .bold. | 00000120 88 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 88 20 88 6e 69 67 68 74 2e |.stormy. .night.| 00000130 00 98 49 74 98 20 98 77 61 73 98 20 98 61 98 20 |..It. .was. .a. | 00000140 98 64 61 72 6b 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 62 6f |.dark. .and. .bo| 00000150 6c 64 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 75 6e 64 65 72 |ld. .and. .under| 00000160 6c 69 6e 65 64 98 20 98 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 98 20 |lined. .stormy. | 00000170 98 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 00 a0 49 74 a0 20 a0 77 |.night....It. .w| 00000180 61 73 a0 20 a0 61 6c 73 6f a0 20 a0 73 75 70 65 |as. .also. .supe| 00000190 72 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 a0 20 20 c0 61 6e 64 |rscripted. .and| 000001a0 c0 20 c0 73 75 62 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 2e c0 |. .subscripted..| 000001b0 20 20 2e 2e 2e 20 62 75 74 20 6e 6f 74 20 62 6f | ... but not bo| 000001c0 74 68 2c 00 61 6e 64 20 6e 6f 74 20 63 6f 6d 62 |th,.and not comb| 000001d0 69 6e 65 64 20 77 69 74 68 20 75 6e 64 65 72 6c |ined with underl| 000001e0 69 6e 69 6e 67 20 6f 72 20 62 6f 6c 64 2e 00 00 |ining or bold...| 000001f0 48 65 20 6c 65 66 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 |He left justifie| 00000200 64 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 58 48 65 20 |d himself...XHe | 00000210 72 69 67 68 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 64 20 |right justified | 00000220 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 24 48 65 20 70 75 |himself...$He pu| 00000230 74 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 20 72 69 67 68 74 20 |t himself right | 00000240 69 6e 20 74 68 65 20 63 65 6e 74 72 65 2e 00 ff |in the centre...| 00000250 0a 48 65 20 6d 61 64 65 20 65 76 65 72 79 74 68 |.He made everyth| 00000260 69 6e 67 20 65 78 70 61 6e 64 20 6f 75 74 2c 20 |ing expand out, | 00000270 61 20 70 61 72 61 67 72 61 70 68 20 65 78 74 65 |a paragraph exte| 00000280 6e 64 69 6e 67 20 6f 76 65 72 20 6d 75 6c 74 69 |nding over multi| 00000290 70 6c 65 00 ff 0a 6c 69 6e 65 73 2c 20 61 20 66 |ple...lines, a f| 000002a0 72 61 67 6d 65 6e 74 20 74 68 61 74 20 62 65 63 |ragment that bec| 000002b0 61 6d 65 20 61 6e 20 69 63 6f 6e 20 75 6e 74 6f |ame an icon unto| 000002c0 20 69 74 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 00 61 82 61 86 61 87 | itself...a.a.a.| 000002d0 61 82 61 81 20 61 6e 64 20 6e 65 78 74 20 41 82 |a.a. and next A.| 000002e0 41 86 41 87 41 82 41 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 6e 82 |A.A.A.A. next n.| 000002f0 6e 86 6e 87 6e 82 6e 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 4e 82 |n.n.n.n. next N.| 00000300 4e 86 4e 87 4e 82 4e 81 20 6d 61 81 6e 81 61 6e |N.N.N.N. ma.n.an| 00000310 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 |a abr.e. al.o. a| 00000320 6c 84 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |l.e.............| 00000330 00 00 00 00 00 00 |......| Most of the document again can be trivially understood as null-delimited strings. Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The failure of the Plus/4 to succeed the 64, much less overtake it, demonstrated clearly to Commodore management that 64 compatibility was essential in their next computer. Around this same time Sig Hartmann had noted the success of Atari's own first-party software unit Atarisoft on non-Atari platforms (though AtariLab was developed externally), even for the 64, and said there were similar plans to port Commodore first-party software and licenses to the Apple II, IBM PC and PCjr. (NARRATOR: This didn't happen.) However, by mid-1984 the software division had also developed a reputation for poor quality, with Scott Mace commenting in InfoWorld that — hits like International Soccer notwithstanding — "so far, the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity." In the meantime, Tramiel had bought the ailing Atari from Warner Communications and lured several Commodore managers, including Hartmann (who was already in conflict with Smith over cuts to the software division), to defect. Paul Goheen, the former systems software group head, became the new software chief. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated.

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14. The left margin is (probably) at byte offset 6 because the right margin is at byte offset 8 (also a 16-bit LE short), followed by the paragraph indent. After this header, we now get the text, shown here in its entirety. 000000a0 00 20 00 49 74 20 77 61 73 20 61 20 64 61 72 6b |. .It was a dark| 000000b0 20 61 6e 64 20 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 20 6e 69 67 68 | and stormy nigh| 000000c0 74 2e 00 90 49 74 90 20 90 77 61 73 90 20 90 61 |t...It. .was. .a| 000000d0 90 20 90 64 61 72 6b 90 20 90 61 6e 64 90 20 90 |. .dark. .and. .| 000000e0 75 6e 64 65 72 6c 69 6e 65 64 90 20 90 73 74 6f |underlined. .sto| 000000f0 72 6d 79 90 20 90 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 88 49 74 |rmy. .night...It| 00000100 88 20 88 77 61 73 88 20 88 61 88 20 88 64 61 72 |. .was. .a. .dar| 00000110 6b 88 20 88 61 6e 64 88 20 88 62 6f 6c 64 88 20 |k. .and. .bold. | 00000120 88 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 88 20 88 6e 69 67 68 74 2e |.stormy. .night.| 00000130 00 98 49 74 98 20 98 77 61 73 98 20 98 61 98 20 |..It. .was. .a. | 00000140 98 64 61 72 6b 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 62 6f |.dark. .and. .bo| 00000150 6c 64 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 75 6e 64 65 72 |ld. .and. .under| 00000160 6c 69 6e 65 64 98 20 98 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 98 20 |lined. .stormy. | 00000170 98 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 00 a0 49 74 a0 20 a0 77 |.night....It. .w| 00000180 61 73 a0 20 a0 61 6c 73 6f a0 20 a0 73 75 70 65 |as. .also. .supe| 00000190 72 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 a0 20 20 c0 61 6e 64 |rscripted. .and| 000001a0 c0 20 c0 73 75 62 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 2e c0 |. .subscripted..| 000001b0 20 20 2e 2e 2e 20 62 75 74 20 6e 6f 74 20 62 6f | ... but not bo| 000001c0 74 68 2c 00 61 6e 64 20 6e 6f 74 20 63 6f 6d 62 |th,.and not comb| 000001d0 69 6e 65 64 20 77 69 74 68 20 75 6e 64 65 72 6c |ined with underl| 000001e0 69 6e 69 6e 67 20 6f 72 20 62 6f 6c 64 2e 00 00 |ining or bold...| 000001f0 48 65 20 6c 65 66 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 |He left justifie| 00000200 64 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 58 48 65 20 |d himself...XHe | 00000210 72 69 67 68 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 64 20 |right justified | 00000220 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 24 48 65 20 70 75 |himself...$He pu| 00000230 74 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 20 72 69 67 68 74 20 |t himself right | 00000240 69 6e 20 74 68 65 20 63 65 6e 74 72 65 2e 00 ff |in the centre...| 00000250 0a 48 65 20 6d 61 64 65 20 65 76 65 72 79 74 68 |.He made everyth| 00000260 69 6e 67 20 65 78 70 61 6e 64 20 6f 75 74 2c 20 |ing expand out, | 00000270 61 20 70 61 72 61 67 72 61 70 68 20 65 78 74 65 |a paragraph exte| 00000280 6e 64 69 6e 67 20 6f 76 65 72 20 6d 75 6c 74 69 |nding over multi| 00000290 70 6c 65 00 ff 0a 6c 69 6e 65 73 2c 20 61 20 66 |ple...lines, a f| 000002a0 72 61 67 6d 65 6e 74 20 74 68 61 74 20 62 65 63 |ragment that bec| 000002b0 61 6d 65 20 61 6e 20 69 63 6f 6e 20 75 6e 74 6f |ame an icon unto| 000002c0 20 69 74 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 00 61 82 61 86 61 87 | itself...a.a.a.| 000002d0 61 82 61 81 20 61 6e 64 20 6e 65 78 74 20 41 82 |a.a. and next A.| 000002e0 41 86 41 87 41 82 41 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 6e 82 |A.A.A.A. next n.| 000002f0 6e 86 6e 87 6e 82 6e 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 4e 82 |n.n.n.n. next N.| 00000300 4e 86 4e 87 4e 82 4e 81 20 6d 61 81 6e 81 61 6e |N.N.N.N. ma.n.an| 00000310 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 |a abr.e. al.o. a| 00000320 6c 84 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |l.e.............| 00000330 00 00 00 00 00 00 |......| Most of the document again can be trivially understood as null-delimited strings. Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14. The left margin is (probably) at byte offset 6 because the right margin is at byte offset 8 (also a 16-bit LE short), followed by the paragraph indent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team. C1541 is free software, covered by the GNU General Public License, and you are welcome to change it and/or distribute copies of it under certain conditions. c1541 #8> dir 0 "data#000 " 01 2a 39 "c.TESTCALC" prg 3 "l.TESTLIST" prg 4 "w.nOTE.2" prg 4 "w.TESTCONV" prg 1278 blocks free. c1541 #8> read "w.TESTCONV" ERR = 62, FILE NOT FOUND, 00, 00 cannot read `w.TESTCONV' on unit 8 invalid filename As you may have guessed, that's because the filenames, and it turns out the data in the files themselves, are stored as true ASCII, not PETSCII (indeed as they would have been on the Apple II, also), so c1541's filename conversion fails. Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated.

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14. The left margin is (probably) at byte offset 6 because the right margin is at byte offset 8 (also a 16-bit LE short), followed by the paragraph indent. After this header, we now get the text, shown here in its entirety. 000000a0 00 20 00 49 74 20 77 61 73 20 61 20 64 61 72 6b |. .It was a dark| 000000b0 20 61 6e 64 20 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 20 6e 69 67 68 | and stormy nigh| 000000c0 74 2e 00 90 49 74 90 20 90 77 61 73 90 20 90 61 |t...It. .was. .a| 000000d0 90 20 90 64 61 72 6b 90 20 90 61 6e 64 90 20 90 |. .dark. .and. .| 000000e0 75 6e 64 65 72 6c 69 6e 65 64 90 20 90 73 74 6f |underlined. .sto| 000000f0 72 6d 79 90 20 90 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 88 49 74 |rmy. .night...It| 00000100 88 20 88 77 61 73 88 20 88 61 88 20 88 64 61 72 |. .was. .a. .dar| 00000110 6b 88 20 88 61 6e 64 88 20 88 62 6f 6c 64 88 20 |k. .and. .bold. | 00000120 88 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 88 20 88 6e 69 67 68 74 2e |.stormy. .night.| 00000130 00 98 49 74 98 20 98 77 61 73 98 20 98 61 98 20 |..It. .was. .a. | 00000140 98 64 61 72 6b 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 62 6f |.dark. .and. .bo| 00000150 6c 64 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 75 6e 64 65 72 |ld. .and. .under| 00000160 6c 69 6e 65 64 98 20 98 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 98 20 |lined. .stormy. | 00000170 98 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 00 a0 49 74 a0 20 a0 77 |.night....It. .w| 00000180 61 73 a0 20 a0 61 6c 73 6f a0 20 a0 73 75 70 65 |as. .also. .supe| 00000190 72 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 a0 20 20 c0 61 6e 64 |rscripted. .and| 000001a0 c0 20 c0 73 75 62 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 2e c0 |. .subscripted..| 000001b0 20 20 2e 2e 2e 20 62 75 74 20 6e 6f 74 20 62 6f | ... but not bo| 000001c0 74 68 2c 00 61 6e 64 20 6e 6f 74 20 63 6f 6d 62 |th,.and not comb| 000001d0 69 6e 65 64 20 77 69 74 68 20 75 6e 64 65 72 6c |ined with underl| 000001e0 69 6e 69 6e 67 20 6f 72 20 62 6f 6c 64 2e 00 00 |ining or bold...| 000001f0 48 65 20 6c 65 66 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 |He left justifie| 00000200 64 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 58 48 65 20 |d himself...XHe | 00000210 72 69 67 68 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 64 20 |right justified | 00000220 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 24 48 65 20 70 75 |himself...$He pu| 00000230 74 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 20 72 69 67 68 74 20 |t himself right | 00000240 69 6e 20 74 68 65 20 63 65 6e 74 72 65 2e 00 ff |in the centre...| 00000250 0a 48 65 20 6d 61 64 65 20 65 76 65 72 79 74 68 |.He made everyth| 00000260 69 6e 67 20 65 78 70 61 6e 64 20 6f 75 74 2c 20 |ing expand out, | 00000270 61 20 70 61 72 61 67 72 61 70 68 20 65 78 74 65 |a paragraph exte| 00000280 6e 64 69 6e 67 20 6f 76 65 72 20 6d 75 6c 74 69 |nding over multi| 00000290 70 6c 65 00 ff 0a 6c 69 6e 65 73 2c 20 61 20 66 |ple...lines, a f| 000002a0 72 61 67 6d 65 6e 74 20 74 68 61 74 20 62 65 63 |ragment that bec| 000002b0 61 6d 65 20 61 6e 20 69 63 6f 6e 20 75 6e 74 6f |ame an icon unto| 000002c0 20 69 74 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 00 61 82 61 86 61 87 | itself...a.a.a.| 000002d0 61 82 61 81 20 61 6e 64 20 6e 65 78 74 20 41 82 |a.a. and next A.| 000002e0 41 86 41 87 41 82 41 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 6e 82 |A.A.A.A. next n.| 000002f0 6e 86 6e 87 6e 82 6e 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 4e 82 |n.n.n.n. next N.| 00000300 4e 86 4e 87 4e 82 4e 81 20 6d 61 81 6e 81 61 6e |N.N.N.N. ma.n.an| 00000310 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 |a abr.e. al.o. a| 00000320 6c 84 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |l.e.............| 00000330 00 00 00 00 00 00 |......| Most of the document again can be trivially understood as null-delimited strings. Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated.

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them.

Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. As you may have guessed, that's because the filenames, and it turns out the data in the files themselves, are stored as true ASCII, not PETSCII (indeed as they would have been on the Apple II, also), so c1541's filename conversion fails. Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ?

'{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated.

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Fortunately it doesn't look like the bad sector was in any of the files they cared about. Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated.

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Cardfiles are stored much more efficiently. Here's the entirety of our two cards. The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record.

We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14. The left margin is (probably) at byte offset 6 because the right margin is at byte offset 8 (also a 16-bit LE short), followed by the paragraph indent. After this header, we now get the text, shown here in its entirety. 000000a0 00 20 00 49 74 20 77 61 73 20 61 20 64 61 72 6b |. .It was a dark| 000000b0 20 61 6e 64 20 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 20 6e 69 67 68 | and stormy nigh| 000000c0 74 2e 00 90 49 74 90 20 90 77 61 73 90 20 90 61 |t...It. .was. .a| 000000d0 90 20 90 64 61 72 6b 90 20 90 61 6e 64 90 20 90 |. .dark. .and. .| 000000e0 75 6e 64 65 72 6c 69 6e 65 64 90 20 90 73 74 6f |underlined. .sto| 000000f0 72 6d 79 90 20 90 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 88 49 74 |rmy. .night...It| 00000100 88 20 88 77 61 73 88 20 88 61 88 20 88 64 61 72 |. .was. .a. .dar| 00000110 6b 88 20 88 61 6e 64 88 20 88 62 6f 6c 64 88 20 |k. .and. .bold. | 00000120 88 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 88 20 88 6e 69 67 68 74 2e |.stormy. .night.| 00000130 00 98 49 74 98 20 98 77 61 73 98 20 98 61 98 20 |..It. .was. .a. | 00000140 98 64 61 72 6b 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 62 6f |.dark. .and. .bo| 00000150 6c 64 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 75 6e 64 65 72 |ld. .and. .under| 00000160 6c 69 6e 65 64 98 20 98 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 98 20 |lined. .stormy. | 00000170 98 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 00 a0 49 74 a0 20 a0 77 |.night....It. .w| 00000180 61 73 a0 20 a0 61 6c 73 6f a0 20 a0 73 75 70 65 |as. .also. .supe| 00000190 72 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 a0 20 20 c0 61 6e 64 |rscripted. .and| 000001a0 c0 20 c0 73 75 62 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 2e c0 |. .subscripted..| 000001b0 20 20 2e 2e 2e 20 62 75 74 20 6e 6f 74 20 62 6f | ... but not bo| 000001c0 74 68 2c 00 61 6e 64 20 6e 6f 74 20 63 6f 6d 62 |th,.and not comb| 000001d0 69 6e 65 64 20 77 69 74 68 20 75 6e 64 65 72 6c |ined with underl| 000001e0 69 6e 69 6e 67 20 6f 72 20 62 6f 6c 64 2e 00 00 |ining or bold...| 000001f0 48 65 20 6c 65 66 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 |He left justifie| 00000200 64 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 58 48 65 20 |d himself...XHe | 00000210 72 69 67 68 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 64 20 |right justified | 00000220 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 24 48 65 20 70 75 |himself...$He pu| 00000230 74 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 20 72 69 67 68 74 20 |t himself right | 00000240 69 6e 20 74 68 65 20 63 65 6e 74 72 65 2e 00 ff |in the centre...| 00000250 0a 48 65 20 6d 61 64 65 20 65 76 65 72 79 74 68 |.He made everyth| 00000260 69 6e 67 20 65 78 70 61 6e 64 20 6f 75 74 2c 20 |ing expand out, | 00000270 61 20 70 61 72 61 67 72 61 70 68 20 65 78 74 65 |a paragraph exte| 00000280 6e 64 69 6e 67 20 6f 76 65 72 20 6d 75 6c 74 69 |nding over multi| 00000290 70 6c 65 00 ff 0a 6c 69 6e 65 73 2c 20 61 20 66 |ple...lines, a f| 000002a0 72 61 67 6d 65 6e 74 20 74 68 61 74 20 62 65 63 |ragment that bec| 000002b0 61 6d 65 20 61 6e 20 69 63 6f 6e 20 75 6e 74 6f |ame an icon unto| 000002c0 20 69 74 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 00 61 82 61 86 61 87 | itself...a.a.a.| 000002d0 61 82 61 81 20 61 6e 64 20 6e 65 78 74 20 41 82 |a.a. and next A.| 000002e0 41 86 41 87 41 82 41 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 6e 82 |A.A.A.A. next n.| 000002f0 6e 86 6e 87 6e 82 6e 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 4e 82 |n.n.n.n. next N.| 00000300 4e 86 4e 87 4e 82 4e 81 20 6d 61 81 6e 81 61 6e |N.N.N.N. ma.n.an| 00000310 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 |a abr.e. al.o. a| 00000320 6c 84 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |l.e.............| 00000330 00 00 00 00 00 00 |......| Most of the document again can be trivially understood as null-delimited strings. Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. 000000a0 00 20 00 49 74 20 77 61 73 20 61 20 64 61 72 6b |. .It was a dark| 000000b0 20 61 6e 64 20 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 20 6e 69 67 68 | and stormy nigh| 000000c0 74 2e 00 90 49 74 90 20 90 77 61 73 90 20 90 61 |t...It. .was. .a| 000000d0 90 20 90 64 61 72 6b 90 20 90 61 6e 64 90 20 90 |. .dark. .and. .| 000000e0 75 6e 64 65 72 6c 69 6e 65 64 90 20 90 73 74 6f |underlined. .sto| 000000f0 72 6d 79 90 20 90 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 88 49 74 |rmy. .night...It| 00000100 88 20 88 77 61 73 88 20 88 61 88 20 88 64 61 72 |. .was. .a. .dar| 00000110 6b 88 20 88 61 6e 64 88 20 88 62 6f 6c 64 88 20 |k. .and. .bold. | 00000120 88 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 88 20 88 6e 69 67 68 74 2e |.stormy. .night.| 00000130 00 98 49 74 98 20 98 77 61 73 98 20 98 61 98 20 |..It. .was. .a. | 00000140 98 64 61 72 6b 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 62 6f |.dark. .and. .bo| 00000150 6c 64 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 75 6e 64 65 72 |ld. .and. .under| 00000160 6c 69 6e 65 64 98 20 98 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 98 20 |lined. .stormy. | 00000170 98 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 00 a0 49 74 a0 20 a0 77 |.night....It. .w| 00000180 61 73 a0 20 a0 61 6c 73 6f a0 20 a0 73 75 70 65 |as. .also. .supe| 00000190 72 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 a0 20 20 c0 61 6e 64 |rscripted. .and| 000001a0 c0 20 c0 73 75 62 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 2e c0 |. .subscripted..| 000001b0 20 20 2e 2e 2e 20 62 75 74 20 6e 6f 74 20 62 6f | ... but not bo| 000001c0 74 68 2c 00 61 6e 64 20 6e 6f 74 20 63 6f 6d 62 |th,.and not comb| 000001d0 69 6e 65 64 20 77 69 74 68 20 75 6e 64 65 72 6c |ined with underl| 000001e0 69 6e 69 6e 67 20 6f 72 20 62 6f 6c 64 2e 00 00 |ining or bold...| 000001f0 48 65 20 6c 65 66 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 |He left justifie| 00000200 64 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 58 48 65 20 |d himself...XHe | 00000210 72 69 67 68 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 64 20 |right justified | 00000220 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 24 48 65 20 70 75 |himself...$He pu| 00000230 74 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 20 72 69 67 68 74 20 |t himself right | 00000240 69 6e 20 74 68 65 20 63 65 6e 74 72 65 2e 00 ff |in the centre...| 00000250 0a 48 65 20 6d 61 64 65 20 65 76 65 72 79 74 68 |.He made everyth| 00000260 69 6e 67 20 65 78 70 61 6e 64 20 6f 75 74 2c 20 |ing expand out, | 00000270 61 20 70 61 72 61 67 72 61 70 68 20 65 78 74 65 |a paragraph exte| 00000280 6e 64 69 6e 67 20 6f 76 65 72 20 6d 75 6c 74 69 |nding over multi| 00000290 70 6c 65 00 ff 0a 6c 69 6e 65 73 2c 20 61 20 66 |ple...lines, a f| 000002a0 72 61 67 6d 65 6e 74 20 74 68 61 74 20 62 65 63 |ragment that bec| 000002b0 61 6d 65 20 61 6e 20 69 63 6f 6e 20 75 6e 74 6f |ame an icon unto| 000002c0 20 69 74 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 00 61 82 61 86 61 87 | itself...a.a.a.| 000002d0 61 82 61 81 20 61 6e 64 20 6e 65 78 74 20 41 82 |a.a. and next A.| 000002e0 41 86 41 87 41 82 41 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 6e 82 |A.A.A.A. next n.| 000002f0 6e 86 6e 87 6e 82 6e 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 4e 82 |n.n.n.n. next N.| 00000300 4e 86 4e 87 4e 82 4e 81 20 6d 61 81 6e 81 61 6e |N.N.N.N. ma.n.an| 00000310 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 |a abr.e. al.o. a| 00000320 6c 84 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |l.e.............| 00000330 00 00 00 00 00 00 |......| Most of the document again can be trivially understood as null-delimited strings. Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Most of the document again can be trivially understood as null-delimited strings. Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting.

For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent.

Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that.

With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete.

Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway.

The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well.

RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ?

Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later.

It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market.

Good read as always. I didn't have any fancy software like Jane, I used (a pirated copy of) Bank Street Writer. I used Bank Street Writer on the Apple IIe in school, and we did have a (legal :-D ) copy for the Commodore 64, but I rapidly outgrew it. It did its job teaching me how to use one, though, so I remember it fondly. Comments are subject to moderation. Be nice. Comments are subject to moderation. Be nice.

Title: Report: Apple has held internal discussions about acquiring Perplexity
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/06/20/report-apple-held-internal-discussions-acquiring-perplexity/
Time Published: 2025-06-20T23:42:00Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 19:42 EDT / JUNE 20 2025 by Maria Deutscher Apple Inc. executives have held discussions about buying Perplexity AI Inc., Bloomberg reported today. The publication cited sources as saying that the talks are in an early stage and may not lead to an acquisition. Perplexity reportedly received a $14 billion valuation in a recent funding round. To be accepted, any takeout offer made by Apple would likely have to be higher. San Francisco-based Perplexity operates a consumer-focused search engine powered by artificial intelligence models. Rather than returning a list of webpages in response to queries, the service generates a natural language response. It can also visualize stock price changes, analyze user-uploaded files and perform other tasks. Perplexity had more than 15 million monthly users last April, a number that has likely increased significantly since then. The company recently disclosed that it processed 780 million user requests in May. Moreover, the volume of queries that it receives is growing by 20% every month. Perplexity generates revenue by offering two paid editions of its search engine. The first, Perplexity Pro, gives users access to reasoning models from providers such as OpenAI. There’s also an Enterprise Pro plan geared towards large organizations. Perplexity’s other revenue source is its Sonar suite of application programming interfaces for developers. Using the APIs, software teams can embed the core features of the company’s search engine into their custom applications. Adrian Perica, Apple’s vice president of corporate development, has reportedly discussed the idea of buying Perplexity with a number of other executives. It’s believed the search provider wasn’t involved in the talks. However, Apple representatives did meet with Perplexity executives multiple times recently to discuss its technology. Today’s report follows an unsuccessful attempt by Meta Platforms Inc. to acquire Perplexity. According to Bloomberg, the Facebook parent walked away from the deal over disagreements about financial terms. Meta later made a $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI Inc., a startup that supplies training datasets for AI development projects. It’s believed that Apple could eventually decide to partner with Perplexity instead of buying it. Such an arrangement would likely cost significantly less. Additionally, it would have a lower chance of drawing scrutiny from antitrust regulators. The acquisition discussions come against the backdrop of a high-profile antitrust trial over Google LLC’s search business. Currently, the Alphabet unit pays Apple billions of dollars annually to keep its search engine the default option on iOS. The lawsuit could potentially require the companies to end the payments. If that happens, Apple may be more inclined to partner with Google competitors such as Perplexity. Perplexity is not the only AI startup that has drawn takeover interest. According to CNBC, Meta recently tried to buy Safe Superintelligence Inc., a company co-founded by former OpenAI Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever. After the offer was rebuffed, the Facebook parent reportedly shifted its focus to recruiting the startup’s top executives.

Catherine McGrath is a crypto fellow at Fortune. Shares of the first publicly-traded stablecoin company Circle continued to surge on Friday after the Senate passed legislation that would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a value in line with the U.S. dollar, earlier this week. Shares of Circle are up 53%, soaring from $148 to $227, since the market opened on Wednesday after the legislation passed in the Senate on Tuesday night. Shares of other crypto-related companies increased on the news with Coinbase, the leading crypto exchange in the U.S., gaining 20% since Wednesday. The legislation, known as the GENIUS act, is a first-of-its-kind bill that would establish regulations and consumer protections for stablecoin companies, including full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance. After passing in the Senate, it will be sent to the House of Representatives for a vote and potential revisions. Circle issues USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market cap behind Tether’s USDT. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire expressed his support for the bill in a post on X after the Senate vote on Tuesday night. “History is being made, as the US Senate passes the GENIUS Act, taking us one step closer to breakthrough legislation being signed into law that will drive U.S. economic and national competitiveness for decades to come,” he wrote. The surge in Circle’s stock price comes weeks after the company’s debut on the stock market under the ticker CRCL. After pricing its shares at $31, CRCL opened on the New York Stock Exchange at $69. Within its first day on the market, the company’s shares soared to a high of $103.75 before closing at $82.23, showcasing strong retail demand for access to the stablecoin industry. Since 2021, stablecoins have become increasingly popular outside of the U.S. as a means to settle cross-border transfers and protect assets against inflation. Crypto firms, however, have long complained that the U.S. stablecoin industry has been hindered by a lack of clear regulations, especially under Biden-era Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Gary Gensler who initiated dozens of investigations and enforcement actions against crypto companies. The Senate’s passage of the GENIUS act was aided by President Donald Trump’s vocal support of the broader crypto industry. In addition to pushing for Congress to pass the stablecoin bill, Trump has established a national Bitcoin reserve, pardoned crypto criminal Ross Ulbricht and appointed SEC officials that have ended a number of lawsuits against crypto companies. With support from the U.S. president and increasing regulatory clarity, mainstream corporations are considering implementing them into their payment structures, including Meta, Google, AirBnB and X. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Why Elon Musk’s US$34 billion loss wasn’t really that – and what it tells us about the philanthropy of the ultra-wealthy

University of St Andrews provides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. View all partners Following a sharp drop in Tesla’s share price, outlets reported that the world’s richest person, Elon Musk, had “lost” US$34 billion (£25 billion) in a single day. That figure exceeds the annual GDP of countries like Iceland, Jamaica or Mauritius. Gaining or losing even 0.001% of that wealth would be life-changing for most people. But, this “loss” is entirely nominal. A decline in share prices means Musk is technically worth less. If prices rebound, so does his net worth. While such volatility can devastate smaller investors reliant on their portfolios, it is a recurring feature of ultra-wealth. Consider the US$100 billion decline in Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s fortune during his Metaverse pivot, or the US$18 billion drop Microsoft founder Bill Gates experienced during the 2008 financial crisis. These share price shifts may reduce billionaires’ net worth on paper, but they rarely affect their lifestyle. Where they do matter however is in philanthropy. Here, timing is everything. The higher the share price at the point of donation, the greater the tax benefit, and the more reputational capital to be locked in. This raises deeper questions about how philanthropic incentives are structured, and who ultimately benefits. Get your news from actual experts, straight to your inbox. Sign up to our daily newsletter to receive all The Conversation UK’s latest coverage of news and research, from politics and business to the arts and sciences. Although philanthropy is often associated with generosity, legacy or moral responsibility, these are only part of the picture. This is particularly true when it comes to major giving by the ultra-wealthy. Instead, from a wealth advisory perspective, one of the most strategically valuable (yet less publicly discussed) motivations is tax management. And, while many assume that philanthropy means donating money, tax systems often encourage the donation of appreciated assets, particularly shares, instead. As a worked example by the Bank of America illustrates, a US$50,000 donation in appreciated stock might easily present a tax benefit of almost US$10,000 over and above the tax benefits of donating the same amount in cash. Why is that? First of all, there is the potential of a tax deduction equal to the fair market value at the point of donation. The value of the asset at the point of donation is important for your tax deduction, not what you actually paid for it or whether its value is going to plunge in future. On top of that, there are opportunities to reduce other taxes too. This includes capital gains or inheritance taxes, the latter illustrated in the establishment of one of the world’s largest foundations, the Ford Foundation and its use as a vehicle to manage both inheritance tax and maintain corporate control. But the benefits of donating shares and other appreciated assets are not just financial. For high-profile donors, philanthropy also serves as a powerful tool for shaping public perceptions, projecting images of civic virtue, moral leadership, and social responsibility. It allows them to convert one form of capital, such as financial wealth, into others – social status, cultural influence or symbolic legitimacy. Volatile, appreciated and often bound-up assets can be unlocked and transformed into something far more enduring – a philanthropic legacy. Even if share prices plunge after the donation, the donor has already secured both a substantial tax benefit and a lasting philanthropic image. Tax management is a longstanding concern in philanthropy, particularly in relation to philanthropic foundations. But it really is donor advised funds (DAFs) that now warrant closer scrutiny as the real “warehouses of wealth”. Constituting one of the fastest-growing vehicles for philanthropy, DAFs act as “giving accounts”. They allow donors to claim charitable contributions and receive immediate tax deductions but without actually making an immediate charitable contribution to society. While donors technically give up ownership of these assets, they retain advisory privileges over whether and when resources are granted, to whom, and in what amounts. DAFs have no legal requirement to disburse funds within a specific timeframe. That means that any charitable spending can be delayed, potentially indefinitely, despite the upfront public subsidy via tax relief. All of these issues raise serious questions as to whether philanthropic architecture is ripe for reform. When donors can receive substantial tax and social benefits by donating volatile assets, regardless of whether or when they benefit the public, it seems that both society and the philanthropy field are shortchanged. First, significant resources are diverted from the public purse into privately controlled channels, often with limited oversight. Second, charitable giving is decoupled from charitable action or impact. Third, influence is consolidated – decisions about how public-subsidised funds are used are made not through democratic processes, but through private choice. The most corrosive effect, however, may be on philanthropy itself. As financial incentives and personal benefits are recast and presented as altruistic, the perception, purposes and potential of philanthropy for the public good risk being eroded and replaced by cynicism. This brings us back to Musk’s US$34 billion “loss”. While headlines framed it as a dramatic reversal of fortune, the real story lies not in the number but in the system behind it. For those whose wealth is held in stock, market volatility presents a tool for tax planning, image-making, strategic giving and long-term influence. What looks like loss may in fact be leverage.

Title: S&P To Crash 50%? Trump Calls Jerome Powell “Dumbest”

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. President Donald Trump reignited his long-standing feud with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday, calling him "one of the dumbest, and most destructive, people in Government [sic]". This is new territory. President Trump had mostly resisted from hurling direct insults against Fed Chair Powell in his second term. Not any more. Could this escalate into Trump firing Chair Powell over the next few months? The comment on social media followed the Fed’s decision to hold interest rates steady, with the Federal Open Market Committee maintaining its target range at 4.25% to 4.5% - unchanged since December. Trump has been calling for lower rates, noting that the Fed was costing the country billions in interest payments. Facade of the Marriner S Eccles building of the United States Federal Reserve, on a bright and sunny ... More day in Washington, DC, United States, July 24, 2017. (Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) Trump’s rhetoric sure does make headlines, but the real danger for investors is the Fed buckling under political pressure and cutting rates too soon. That could unleash a second wave of inflation, which might be more entrenched than the post-Covid surge. If that happens, expect a sharp reset in valuations, a spike in bond yields, and a steep correction in the S&P 500. Cutting interest rates before inflation is fully tamed risks igniting a more persistent cycle of price increases, forcing the Fed to respond later with even more aggressive hikes, just as it did in the 1970s, when inflation spiraled out of control. Is 50% drop in S&P possible? Consider this. Back then, the Fed’s delayed tightening led to stagflation and a severe equity downturn: the S&P 500 fell nearly 50% between 1972 and 1974. What’s more, higher valuations today, coupled with policy uncertainty, might actually make things worse. For investors seeking upside with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative. This portfolio has outperformed the S&P 500 and delivered cumulative returns of over 91% since inception. Trump's Policies Create The Perfect Storm? This time around, there is a risk of persistent supply-side inflation driven by policy. Trump’s policy agenda, which includes 3 things [1] tariffs, [2] mass deportations, and [3] tax cuts, could create a perfect storm of sorts. First, tariffs are a supply shock. They raise input costs and consumer prices by removing cheaper imports from the market. Second, mass deportations of immigrants who entered the country illegally sounds reasonable - after all, they’re illegal immigrants - except that it will make cheaper labor unavailable. On average, the price of services will go up. This could be a big factor driving inflation higher. Third, there are the tax cuts under Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill, under which most taxpayers are expected to see a tax cut, with all income groups reportedly likely to benefit. Now, while tariffs and deportations constrain the supply of goods and services to increase prices, reduction in taxes makes more cash available to consumers. So people can spend more while prices are higher. The result would be spiking inflation, and this would make the Fed’s job a lot harder. A Replay of the 1970s? The Fed will likely pull out its 2022 playbook: it’ll have no choice but to increase interest rates - not just reverting some of the recent cuts, but in fact, going beyond, to rates above 6% and even 7% or higher for short-term treasuries. Now, if you can get a guaranteed 6% on a 1-year Treasury bill, or bank savings - risk-free investments - won’t you demand higher earnings and returns from stocks as well? There will be an exodus - a massive outflow from the S&P and overall markets from risky equities into treasuries, CDs, and savings accounts. It happened in 2022 - within months, the S&P 500 tumbled by 20%. It’s easy to forget that stocks including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) had lost more than 50% in the 2022 rate cycle alone (Can Nvidia Stock Lose 50%?). Smaller companies, with less cash on their balance sheets, fared even worse. That said, in 2022, inflation was largely transitory, and the Fed was able to bring it under control. This time, it could be entrenched. Covid-related stimulus money was a transient cause of 2022 inflation. This time, tariffs, tax cuts, and deportations, together, are likely to prove a stronger and perhaps much more persistent force. A replaying of the 1970s crisis is very much possible, taking the S&P 500 down. Higher rates don’t just hurt stocks - they make U.S. debt less sustainable. Annual interest payments now already exceed $1 trillion, and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has called it a red flag. If bond markets start to question the government’s fiscal path, yields could spike, deepening the equity selloff. On top of that, loan defaults are rising both in the commercial real estate sector and across consumer debt, like credit cards and auto loans. Big lenders like JPMorgan, BofA, and Citigroup are especially exposed. So, how much would that hurt? Well, the combined market cap of S&P 500 constituents is roughly $47 trillion. So a 50% decline in the index would mean a loss of more than $23 trillion in value. And you thought the $5 trillion-plus wipeout the benchmark index witnessed in the first few days of April 2025 was bad! How Low Can JPMorgan Stock Go In A Market Crash? A Question When things are bad, what do you expect Trump to do? Blame everyone else, or change his course on taxes, deportation, and tariffs? There’s certainly hope that his cabinet and loyalists will be able to sway his view into easing inflationary policies in the event they create spiking inflation before the U.S. economy plunges into a recession. But if the easing does not materialize or comes into play too late, how bad can things get if there is another recession?

InfoQ Homepage Articles Analyzing Apache Kafka Stretch Clusters: WAN Disruptions, Failure Scenarios, and DR Strategies Jun 20, 2025 31 min read by Srikanth Daggumalli Nishchai Jayanna Manjula reviewed by Steef-Jan Wiggers Apache Kafka is a well-known publish-subscribe distributed system widely used across industries for use cases such as log analytics, observability, event-driven architectures, and real-time streaming. Its distribution allows it to become the critical piece or backbone of modern streaming architecture, offering many integrations and supporting near-real-time or real-time latency requirements. Today, Kafka has been offered by major companies as a service, including Confluent Kafka as well as cloud offerings such as Confluent Cloud, AWS Managed Streaming Kafka , Google Cloud Managed Service for Apache Kafka, Azure Event Hub for Apache Kafka, etc. Additionally, Kafka has been deployed across over one-hundred-thousand companies, including Fortune 100 across various industry segments such as enterprise, financials, healthcare, automobile, startups, independent software vendors, and retail sectors. The value of the data diminishes over time. Many businesses these days compete in time and demand real-time data processing with millisecond responses to power mission-critical applications. Financial services, e-commerce, IoT, and other latency-sensitive industries require highly available and resilient architectures that can withstand infrastructure failures without impacting business continuity. Companies operating across multiple geographic locations need solutions that provide seamless failover, data consistency, and disaster recovery (DR) capabilities while minimizing operational complexity and cost. One of the common architectural patterns that companies often consider using is a single Kafka cluster spanning multiple data center locations on WAN (Wide Area Network). It is called Stretch Cluster. This pattern is commonly considered by companies for disaster recovery (DR) and high availability (HA). Stretch Cluster can theoretically provide data redundancy across regions and minimize data loss in the event of a region-wide failure. However, this approach comes with several challenges and trade-offs due to the inherent nature of Kafka and its dependency on network latency, consistency, and partition tolerance in a multi-region setup. In this article, we are going to focus on the stretch cluster architectural pattern for DR or HA-related implications and considerations. The following testing has been conducted, and the cluster behavior has been documented. Below is the high-level view of a single stretch cluster setup that spans across the London and Frankfurt regions with In this use case, we have used a producer written in Java that consistently produces defined (K) Transactions Per Second (aka TPS), which can be controlled using properties files. Sample snippets using Kafka performance test api. In this use case, we have used consumers written in Java that consistently consume defined (K) transactions per second (TPS), which can be controlled using properties files. Before diving into further discussions and scenario executions, it's crucial to understand the fundamental algorithms of distributed systems. This foundational knowledge will help you better correlate WAN disruptions with their impact on system behavior. CAP Theorem (i.e., Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance) applies to all the distributed systems like Kafka, Hadoop, Elasticsearch, and many others, where data is being distributed across nodes to: Consistency (C) Every read gets the latest write or an error. Availability (A) Every request gets a response, even if some nodes fail. Partition Tolerance (P) The system keeps working despite network issues. Kafka is an AP system; it prioritizes Availability and Partition Tolerance, while consistency is eventual and tunable via settings. Now, let's get into the scenarios. Before going in-depth into scenarios, let's understand the key components and terminology of Kafka internals. As discussed in earlier sections, in a distributed network setup across geographic locations, network service interruptions can occur because no service guarantees 100% availability. This scenario focuses on WAN disruption between two regions, causing Kafka service unavailability, leaving the cluster with zero active controllers and no self-recovery, even after hours of waiting. Kafka is unavailable and can't be recovered on its own upon WAN service disruption and reestablishment and shows active controllers as '0' It's a "brain-dead" scenario. Upon WAN disruption, a single 4-node cluster becomes 2 independent clusters, each with 2 nodes. WAN disruption can be done by deleting or modifying route tables. Warning: Deleting a route table may disrupt all traffic in the associated subnets. Instead, consider modifying or detaching the route table. You may need to shut down firewalls Firewall status: systemctl status firewalld Firewall stop: service firewalld stop ZK Server start: bin/zookeeper-server-start etc/kafka/zookeeper.properties ZK Server stop: zookeeper-server-stop ZK Shell commands: bin/zookeeper-shell.sh <zookeeper host>:2181 Active controllers check: get /controller or ls /controller Brokers list: /home/opc/kafka/bin/zookeeper-shell kafkabrokeraddress:2181 <<<"ls /brokers/ids" Alternative to check controllers and brokers in a cluster. Available from kafka 3.7.x bin/kafka-metadata-shell.sh --bootstrap-server <KAFKA_BROKER>:9092 --describe-cluster Kafka is not available and can't be recovered on its own upon WAN service disruption and re-establishment and shows active controllers as '2' Kafka is not available and couldn't be recovered on its own upon and showed active controllers as '0' From the logs, observed disk-related errors and exceptions Logs show that the controller moved the exception from one broker to another broker, but no exit or hang was reported in the logs Controllers '0' behavior is equal to the brain-dead scenario explained in scenario 2. Killing broker and ZK processes (an uncontrolled shutdown can be comparable with machine abrupt reboot) and restarting brokers lead to corrupted indices, rebuilding indices doesn't work even after hours of waiting. This scenario is comparable to an ungraceful shutdown during an environment upgrade or to a poor security posture, where an unauthorized person could terminate the service. Kafka is not available and couldn't be recovered on its own. From the logs, 'index corrupted' logs for partitions are shown, and also 'rebuilding indices logs'. Rebuilding indices didn't work and doesn't show any related logs on progress. The resulting cluster is in unavailable status even after 1 hour. Also, it is recommended to do graceful shutdowns instead of using the kill switch or doing abrupt shutdowns so the data in the Kafka local cache will be flushed to the disks by maintaining meta data information and also committing offsets. Deploying on-premise stretch clusters requires a deep understanding of failure scenarios, particularly during network disruptions. Unlike cloud environments, on-premises setups may lack highly available network infrastructure, fault tolerance mechanisms, or dedicated fiber lines, making them more susceptible to outages. In such cases, a Kafka cluster may experience downtime if network connectivity is disrupted. Cloud providers, on the other hand, offer high-bandwidth, low-latency networking over fully redundant, dedicated metro fiber connections between regions and data centers. Their managed Kafka services are designed for high availability, typically recommending deployment across multiple zones or regions to withstand zonal failures. Additionally, these services incorporate zone-awareness features, ensuring Kafka data replication occurs across multiple zones, rather than being confined to a single one. It is also important to understand and emphasize the latency impact on a stretch cluster deployed in two different Geo locations with a WAN connection. We can not escape physics; in our case, as per WonderNetwork, the average latency between London and Frankfurt is 14.88 milliseconds for a distance of 636km. So, for mission-critical applications, the setup of a stretch cluster driven by latencies, through testing, is needed to determine how the data is being replicated and consumed across. By understanding these differences, organizations can make informed decisions about whether an on-premise stretch cluster aligns with their availability and resilience requirements or if a cloud-native Kafka deployment is a more suitable alternative. A Business Continuity Plan (BCP) is essential for any business to maintain its brand and reputation. Almost all the companies think of High Availability (HA) and Disaster recovery (DR) strategies to meet their BCP. Below are the popular DR Strategies for Kafka. Before we dive deep into DR strategies further, let's understand that the Kafka Mirror Maker 2.0 we are using in the following architectural patterns. There are other components like Kafka Connect, Replicator, etc., offered by Confluent and other cloud services, but they are out of scope for this article. DNS Redirection in Apache Kafka is a cross-cluster replication tool that uses the Kafka Connect framework to replicate topics between clusters, supporting active-active and active-passive setups. It provides automatic consumer group synchronization, offset translation, and failover support for disaster recovery and multi-region architectures. This is a popular DR strategy pattern where there will be two different Kafka clusters, which are of identical size & configuration, deployed in two different Geo regions or Data centers. In this case, it's the London and Frankfurt regions. Usually, Geo location choice depends upon Earth's different tectonic plates, company or country compliance and regulations requirements, and other factors. Out of which only one cluster is active at a given point of time, which receives and serves the clients. As shown in the following picture, Kafka cluster one (KC1) is located in the London region and Kafka cluster two (KC2) is located in the Frankfurt region with the same size and configuration. All the producers are producing data to KC1 (London region cluster), and all consumers are consuming the data from the same cluster. KC2 (Frankfurt region cluster) receives the data from the KC1 cluster through Mirror Maker as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: Kafka Active Standby (aka Active Passive) cluster setup with Mirror role In simple terms, we can treat the mirror maker as a combination of producer and consumer, where it consumes the topics from the source cluster KC1 (London region) and produces the data to the destination cluster KC2 (Frankfurt region). During the disaster to the primary/active cluster KC1 (London region), the standby cluster (Frankfurt region) will become active, and all the producers and consumers' traffic redirected to the standby cluster. This can be achieved through DNS redirection via a load balancer in front of Kafka clusters. Fig 2 shows this scenario. Figure 2: Kafka Active Standby setup - Standby cluster becomes active When the London Region KC1 cluster becomes active, we need to set up a mirror maker instance to consume the data from the Frankfurt region cluster and produce back to it to the London region KC1 cluster. This scenario is shown in Fig. 3. It's up to the business to keep the Frankfurt region (KC2) active or promote the London region cluster (KC1) back to primary once the data is fully synced/hydrated to the current state. In some cases, the standby cluster, i.e., the Frankfurt region cluster (KC2), continues to function like an active cluster and the London region cluster (KC1) becomes the standby as well. It is essential to note that RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective) values are high compared to the Active-Active setup. Active-standby setup cost is medium to high as we need to maintain the same Kafka clusters in both regions. Figure 3: Kafka Active Standby setup – Standby cluster data sync happening to the KC1 Kafka Mirror Maker Replication Lag (Δ): Let's take a scenario, and it might happen very rarely, where we lose all the cluster completely, including nodes and disks, etc. Where the Active Kafka Cluster (London region - KC1) has 'm' messages, and the mirror maker is consuming and producing to the standby cluster. Due to network latency or consumers & producing process with acknowledgements, the standby cluster (i.e., Frankfurt region - KC2) lags behind and holds only 'n' messages. Which means the delta(\(\Delta\)) is m minus n. \(\Delta = m - n\) where: Due to this replication lag (\(\Delta\)), it will have the following impact on mission-critical applications Potential Message Loss: If a failover occurs before the Standby cluster catches up, some messages (\(\Delta\)) may be missing. Inconsistent Data: Consumers relying on the Standby cluster may process incomplete or outdated data. Delayed Processing: Applications depending on real-time replication may experience latency in data availability. The replication lag concern can be overcome with the Active-Active setup. Just like the Active standby setup, we will have the same Kafka clusters deployed in the London and Frankfurt regions. The producers of the ingestion pipeline will write the data to both clusters at any given point in time. Which is also known as Dual Writes. So, both clusters' data is in sync as shown in Fig. 4. Please note that the ingestion pipeline or producers should have the capability to support dual writes. It is also important to note that these write pipelines should be isolated so that any issue with one cluster should not impact other pipelines or create back pressure and producer latencies. For example, if your use case is log analytics or observability, considering Logstash in your ingestion and creating two separate pipelines within a single or more Logstash instances will act as an isolated pipeline. But only one cluster is active for the consumers at any given point of time. Figure 4: Active-Active setup or Dual writes. In case, as shown in Figure 5, any issues with the one cluster the consumers need to be redirected with DNS redirect and RTO and RPO or SLAs are near zero. Figure 5: Active-Active setup, one cluster is unavailable Once the London cluster is available and becomes active, data can sync back to the London cluster from the Frankfurt cluster using Mirror Maker. As shown in Fig. 6, consumers can be switched back to the London cluster using DNS redirect. Also, it is important to configure consumer groups to start where they left off. During this setup, during the failover, it is important to configure consumers' offset to read the messages from a particular point in time, like reply messages from the last current time minus 15 mins, or set up a mirror maker between active clusters to read 'only' consumer offset topics from the London region cluster and replicate to the Frankfurt region cluster. And during the failure, you can use source.auto.offset.reset=latest to read the data from the latest offsets in the Frankfurt region cluster. If the consumer groups are not properly configured, you may see duplicate messages in your downstream system. So, it's essential to design the downstream to handle duplicate records. For example, if it's an observability use case and if the downstream is OpenSearch, it's good practice to design a unique ID depending on the message timestamp and other parameters like session IDs, etc. So, that duplicate message will overwrite the existing duplicate record and maintain only one record. Figure 6: Active-Active setup cluster syncing data with MirrorMaker Message ordering challenges occur when writing to two clusters simultaneously, messages may arrive in different orders due to network delays between regions. This can be particularly problematic for applications that require strict message ordering. So, it needs to be handled in the data processing time or downstream systems. For example, defining a primary key within the message body timestamp field would order the messages based on timestamps. Data Consistency Issues can occur while establishing dual writes to two different clusters. It requires robust monitoring and reconciliation processes to ensure data integrity across clusters. Because there might be conditions where data might successfully write to one cluster but fail in another, resulting in data inconsistency. Producer complexity is an issue in this active-active setup. Producers need to handle writing to two clusters and manage failures independently for each cluster, so isolation of each pipeline is important. This setup might increase the complexity of the producer applications and require more resources to manage dual writes effectively. There are some agents or tools in the market also as open-source offerings that will provide dual pipeline options such as Elastic Logstash. Consumer group management is complex. Managing consumer offsets across multiple clusters could be challenging, especially during failover scenarios, and can lead to message duplication. Consumer applications or downstream systems need to be designed to handle duplicate messages or implement deduplication logic. Operational Overhead - Running active-active clusters requires sophisticated monitoring tools and increases operational costs significantly. Teams need to maintain detailed runbooks and conduct regular disaster recovery drills to ensure smooth failover processes. Network Latency Considerations- Cross-region network latency and bandwidth costs become critical factors in active-active setups. Reliable network connectivity between regions is essential for maintaining data consistency and managing replication effectively. Backup and restore is a cost-effective architectural pattern compared to Active Standby(AP) or Active Active(AA) DR architectural patterns. It is suitable for non-critical applications with higher RTO and RPO values compared to AA or AP patterns. Backup and restore is a cost-effective option because we need only one Kafka cluster. In case the Kafka cluster is unavailable, the data from the centralized repository can be replayed/restored to the Kafka cluster once it becomes available. In this architectural pattern, shown in Figure 7, all the data will be saved to a persistent location like Amazon S3 or another data lake, where the data can be restored/replayed to the Kafka cluster when the Kafka cluster is available. It is also common to see a new environment of Kafka clusters built together using terraform templates and build a new Kafka cluster and replay data. Figure 7: Backup and restore architectural pattern Recovery time impact is a major consideration; Restoring (aka replaying) large volumes of data to Kafka can take significant time, resulting in a higher RTO. This makes it suitable only for applications that can tolerate longer downtimes. Data consistency challenges are also an issue. When restoring data from backup storage like Amazon S3, maintaining the exact message ordering and partitioning as the original cluster can be challenging. Special attention is needed to ensure data consistency during restoration. Backup performance overhead is a further consideration. Regular backups to external storage can impact the performance of the production cluster. The backup process needs careful scheduling and resource management to minimize impact on production workloads. Storage is key. Managing large volumes of backup data requires effective storage lifecycle policies and controlling costs. Regular cleanup of old backups and efficient storage utilization strategies are essential. Coordination during recovery is mandatory. The recovery process requires careful coordination between backing up offset information and actual messages. Missing either can lead to message loss or duplication during restoration. As we explored earlier, choosing a DR strategy isn't one-size-fits-all, it comes with trade-offs. It often boils down to finding the right balance between what the business needs and what it can afford. The decision usually depends on several factors. SLAs (e.g., 99.99%+ uptime) are pre-defined commitments to uptime and availability. An SLA requiring 99.99% uptime allows only 52.56 minutes of downtime per year. The RTO metric is used to define the maximum acceptable downtime for a system or application after a failure before it causes unacceptable business harm. Knowledge/content/training systems, for example, can expect one hour or more downtime because they are not mission critical. For banking applications, on the other hand, downtime acceptance could be none or a couple of minutes. The RPO metric is used to define the maximum acceptable amount of data loss during a disruptive event, measured in time from the most recent backup. For example, an observability/monitoring application can have the acceptability for losing the past hour whereas a financial application can not tolerate losing a single record of transaction data. Associated costs vary. Higher availability and faster recovery typically come at a higher price. Organizations must weigh their need for uptime and data protection against the financial investment required. References: A round-up of last week’s content on InfoQ sent out every Tuesday.
