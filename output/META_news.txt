Wall Street investors appear to be betting on Snapchat and Instagram benefiting from TikTok’s U.S. exile The stock price for Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat, jumped 8.3% on Wednesday morning, while Meta’s share price increased 3.7% as both companies look set to benefit from TikTok’s looming ban from the U.S. Snap’s Wall Street surge pushed the company to $12.28 per share and a market cap of $20.5 billion. The Santa Monica-based company’s stock price has been on a roller coaster ride to start 2025, but following Wednesday’s early gains, Snap’s stock price is up 9.25% on the year. Meanwhile Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is trading at $616.29 per share and has a market cap of $638.4 billion. The stock jumps are likely tied to TikTok saying it would shut down its app this coming Sunday if a last-minute deal is not made to keep the app active in the States. ByteDance, The app’s Beijing-based parent company, is facing a Jan. 19 deadline to divest TikTok’s American assets. TikTok’s decision to shut down the app — which has 170 million monthly American users — goes one step further than the law, signed by President Biden last April, requires. The law bans new downloads from Apple’s App Store and the Google Play app store, and also makes it “unlawful” to update the app. In other words, existing users could keep the app on their phones, but it would never update. If TikTok turns off, Snapchat and Instagram would likely see a boost in users and usage. YouTube would also presumably benefit, and the stock price of Alphabet, its parent company, is up 2.3% on Wednesday. And Snap, in a timely effort to make it easier for users to find influencers on the platform, launched a “find your favorites on Snapchat” campaign on Wednesday. The law banning TikTok requires ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations to remain operating in States. The chief concern U.S. lawmakers say they have with TikTok is that it could double as a spyware app for the Chinese communist government; TikTok, per Chinese law, is required to share user data if asked to do so. In the days leading up to the ban, two Chinese social apps — Xiaohongshu and Lemon8, which is also run by ByteDance — have raced to the top of Apple’s App Store (You can read more about Lemon8 by clicking here). A potential TikTok ban has been lingering for several years now. Donald Trump first proposed removing the app from the U.S. during his first term in office before Congress ultimately passed the law banning the app last year. Despite his initial support, President-elect Trump has since changed his tune on banning TikTok, saying last year that he would like to “save” the app. And in December, Trump reiterated he would like to keep TikTok in the U.S. He said he’d “take a look” at saving TikTok, noting he had a “warm spot” in his heart for it because it helped get young people to vote for him. The Supreme Court is currently weighing TikTok’s plea to overturn the law banning the app, but it does not appear likely before Sunday, when the app’s ban date hits.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp.’s $3 trillion run-up in market value in the two years since ChatGPT helped trigger an AI frenzy is bigger than any stock rally in history in such a short time span. But the landscape is now changing for the chipmaker. Most Read from Bloomberg These Homes Withstood the LA Fires. Architects Explain Why As E-Bikes Boom in NYC, Some Call for More Regulations Chicago Agency Pitches $1.5 Billion Plan to Fix Transit Woes NYPD Reforms Car Chase Policy Amid Rising Crashes, Injuries Churches, Cinemas — and Moon Artifacts — Top List of Endangered Monuments Competitors and customers are stepping up efforts to take a bigger slice of the artificial intelligence chip market. The sector’s blistering revenue growth is slowing. The Biden White House is looking to limit the sale of Nvidia’s most-advanced chips abroad, although it’s unclear how President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming administration will handle that. Sounds scary? None of these risks are deterring investors from betting that Nvidia’s rally could add hundreds of billions of dollars more in market value in 2025 as the deluge of spending on AI computing keeps gaining steam. “I’m not concerned we’ve seen a peak in Nvidia,” said Kevin Mahn, chief investment officer at Hennion & Walsh Asset Management. “There’s more growth to be had, although we should also see more volatility. The AI revolution is going to be a long road with a lot of potholes.” That turbulence has been on display recently, with Nvidia shares slumping after a presentation by Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang fell short of investors’ high expectations. The stock dropped for five-straight sessions, shedding 12% since hitting a record on Jan. 6, as of its Tuesday close. It rose 1.7% on Wednesday. Investors say these kinds of swings come with the territory. “Nvidia’s stock is always going to be way more volatile than the market,” said Joanne Feeney, portfolio manager and partner at Advisors Capital Management, which raised its price target on the shares earlier this week. “We see it as having multiple years of well-above average growth in earnings, and we do see that as explaining and sustaining the valuation.” Nvidia shares are projected to rise about 30% over the coming year, according to the average of analyst price targets compiled by Bloomberg. That would give the chipmaker a market value of more than $4 trillion, potentially dwarfing its closest peers Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Its revenue is expected to hit $129 billion in its current fiscal year, which ends Jan. 30, up from $27 billion two years ago. That said, there are plenty of potential hazards ahead. Here’s a look at the biggest issues Nvidia faces in the coming year: AI Spending Nvidia’s rally ultimately depends on demand for AI services. Nearly half its revenue comes from a handful of tech giants who are rushing to add computing capacity. Capital expenditures by Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. are projected to hit a combined $257 billion in the current fiscal year, up from $209 billion in 2024. Of course, those plans could change if the companies and their customers aren’t generating the big sales they expected from AI. “At some point we’re going to need to see new applications drive revenue acceleration for other companies for this investment to continue,” said Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson and one of only eight of 78 analysts tracked by Bloomberg who doesn’t have a buy rating on the shares. Outside of hardware makers like Nvidia, the most visible AI revenue growth is coming from the big web services providers like Amazon, Google Cloud and Microsoft’s Azure. However, it’s still a relatively small amount compared with how much the companies are spending on developing the technology. So far, few of the tech giants’ cloud computing customers are seeing significant revenue growth from AI. Salesforce.com Inc. shares have rallied on high expectations for new AI offerings, but the customer relationship management software company hasn’t seen much of a sales boost yet. Palantir Technologies Inc., which makes data analysis software, has said its AI services are driving revenue growth. “It’s imperative that the hyperscaler customers start generating meaningful returns,” Luria said. Competition Nvidia has a virtual monopoly on AI accelerators and is attempting to stay ahead of the competition by speeding up the pace for rolling out new chip lines. Its latest, Blackwell, initially faced manufacturing challenges that slowed its release. But Huang said it’s in full production now and will begin shipping in the current quarter, adding that demand for Blackwell is “very strong” and expected to exceed supply for several quarters. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. is probably Nvidia’s closest competitor. But its projected AI accelerator sales of more than $5 billion in 2024 are just a sliver of Nvidia’s expected $114 billion in data center revenue in its current fiscal year. Intel Corp., which is in the midst of a troubled turnaround, is even further behind as weaker than expected orders for AI accelerators have led to sales that the company said won’t reach its target of $500 million for 2024. Meanwhile, chipmakers Broadcom Inc. and Marvell Technology Inc. are gathering momentum in sales of custom-made semiconductors and networking components used in data centers. Broadcom forecast in December that the market for the AI components it designs will reach as much as $90 billion by fiscal 2027, sending its shares soaring and raising concerns that so-called ASIC chips could take share away from Nvidia. However, it’s unlikely that those custom chips will hurt Nvidia much given Blackwell’s significant technological advancement, according to Morgan Stanley analysts led by Joseph Moore. “Competing directly with Nvidia on cluster level specifications will likely remain a challenge,” they wrote in December. And then there are the chipmaker’s biggest customers, who are hustling to develop their own semiconductors to avoid Nvidia’s high prices. Amazon has begun shipping the second generation of Trainium, which it aims to string together in clusters of up to 100,000 chips. Alphabet’s Google began building an AI chip a decade ago, and the latest edition is expected to be widely available this year. Microsoft Corp. announced an accelerator called Maia and a central processing unit in late 2023. Valuation How much investors will pay for Nvidia’s stock comes down to its growth outlook. With customers set to spend more on hardware and competition still playing catch up, that view looks bright at the moment. The shares are priced at almost 31 times profits projected over the next 12 months, below the average over the past decade of 34 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Still, that valuation requires Nvidia’s profits to continue to boom at a time when growth is slowing and higher costs related to the development of Blackwell are expected to weigh on margins. Nvidia sales are projected to climb 112% in fiscal 2025, 53% in fiscal 2026 and 21% in fiscal 2027. Its gross margin is expected to dip as low as 73% in the current quarter, down from 75% in the previous period, Nvidia said in November. However, it anticipates margins rebounding when production ramps up. For a company that’s growing as fast as Nvidia, it all adds up to a fair price, according to Scott Yuschak, managing director of equity strategy at Truist Advisory Services. “There’s still plenty of growth left for Nvidia in 2025 and there’s still reason to be interested in the stock,” Yuschak said. “Still, that number depends on bigger and bigger spending. If there are any signs of a slowdown in AI spending, the price investors are willing to pay for Nvidia shares will fall.” Top Tech Stories The US plans to unveil more regulations aimed at keeping advanced chips made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and other producers from flowing to China, part of a flurry of measures introduced by the Biden administration during its final days in office.

Estimates for California's devastating fires continue to grow with some estimates reaching as high ... [+] as $180 billion. (Photo by David Swanson / AFP) (Photo by DAVID SWANSON/AFP via Getty Images) Key Takeaways Stocks were mixed on Tuesday with the S&P 500 up just 0.1% while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.2%. Both the Russell 2000 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 1% and 0.5%, respectively. The muted moves came following the release of the Producer Price Index, which showed slower than expected increases in prices. Tuesday's Core PPI was forecast to show an increase of 0.4% on a month-to-month basis, but the actual increase was just 0.2%. That number offered a preview of today's Consumer Price Index, which was expected to show core prices increased month-over-month by 0.3% and a yearly increase of 3.3%, according to Bloomberg. The actual numbers were slightly below those expectations. Month-over-month was up 0.2% while year-over-year, prices were higher by 3.2%. Turning to earnings, major banks are kicking things off this morning. So far, we've heard from JP Morgan who beat on both the top and bottom lines, sending that stock higher by 2% in premarket. Wells Fargo also beat on earnings. One standout metric was their investment banking fees which grew by 59%. Wells in not typically the first name that comes to mind when discussing investment banking, so this may be an area of growth to keep an eye on. But net interest income is the standout metric here for both banks. JP Morgan and Wells Fargo forecast strong growth for net interest income in 2025. Goldman Sachs also released their earnings in premarket. The company crushed expectations across the board. Goldman said it expected investment banking and trading fees to grow double digits in 2025. Lastly, Citigroup is out with earnings, issuing beats on the top and bottom lines. All four banking stocks are trading higher in premarket activity. A few other stocks in the news include Meta, Alphabet and Eli Lilly. Meta announced it will more aggressively manage out underperforming workers and as a result the company will cut 5% of its workforce in the U.S. As the job market is cooling, we're seeing the power pendulum swing back towards companies. This comes after a red-hot labor market was giving job seekers a significant advantage following Covid. Alphabet is being investigated by U.K antitrust regulators over how Google search results may affect competition. Lastly, Eli Lilly cut its fourth-quarter forecast citing weaker than expected growth for the company's insulin and weight loss drugs. However, the company did say they expect strong growth for their weight loss drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound in 2025. Turning to the chip sector, the Biden administration announced it plans more regulations for advanced chips being produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and others from being exported to China. Another stock in the AI chip sector that's making news is Nvidia. Shares of that stock have fallen for the past five trading days and are down 12% from their highs, putting the stock in a correction. This is particularly noteworthy because Nvidia has been at the forefront of the stock market rally over the past couple years. Therefore, it will be interesting to see if this is simply some short-term profit taking, the beginning of a longer-term downturn for the overall market, or a changing of the guard and opportunity for another sector to lead the market. A few more odds and ends. After hitting a low of just over $89,000 on Monday, bitcoin is trading higher and looks set to make another run at $100,000. Oil prices remain within striking distance of $80 per barrel. As I've previously mentioned, so long as oil remains below $80, its impact on the economy is relatively muted. However, a break above $80 may prompt fears of a return of inflation. Finally, Forbes is saying the cost from the California fires may reach as high as $150 billion. This is simply a tragic story and one that, unfortunately, continues to unfold. For today, the story is a combination of earnings and muted inflation. The outlook for the banking sector, especially net interest income, is being buoyed by forecasts for fewer interest rates cuts by the Fed. Elevated rates mean more interest income. The outlook for rates should come as no surprise to regular readers of my column as I've been discussing it ad nauseam. Combine that with a weaker than expected CPI and you get stocks up nearly 2% in premarket trading. I would caution readers that this is just the very beginning of earnings season and there is a long way to go still. However, the start is looking pretty good and may be exactly what this market needs. As always, I would stick with your investing plans and long-term objectives. tastytrade, Inc. commentary for educational purposes only.

Accurate energy demand forecasting is critical for efficient energy management and planning. Recent advancements in computing power and the availability of large datasets have fueled the development of machine learning models. However, selecting the most appropriate features to enhance prediction accuracy and robustness remains a key challenge. This study proposes an ensemble approach that integrates a genetic algorithm with multiple forecasting models to optimize feature selection. The genetic algorithm identifies the optimal subset of features from a dataset that includes historical energy consumption, weather variables, and temporal characteristics. These selected features are then used to train three base learners: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The predictions from these models are combined using a stacking ensemble technique to generate the final forecast. To enhance model evaluation, we divided the dataset into weekday and weekend subsets, allowing for a more detailed analysis of energy consumption patterns. To ensure the reliability of our findings, we conducted ten simulations and applied the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test to the results. The proposed model demonstrated exceptional precision, achieving a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 130.6, a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.38%, and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 99.41 for weekday data. The model also maintained high accuracy for weekend predictions, with an RMSE of 137.41, a MAPE of 0.42%, and an MAE of 105.67. This research provides valuable insights for energy analysts and contributes to developing more sophisticated demand forecasting methods.

In the modern era, accurate energy demand forecasting has become an essential component of efficient energy management. Energy consumption is rising for various reasons, such as population growth, increasing building energy needs, and expanding technological applications. According to the data presented in [1], global energy consumption is expected to rise by approximately 70% by the year 2040. This alarming figure has necessitated the development of advanced predictive models to forecast energy demand, which are crucial for optimizing energy use in smart cities, thereby making them more efficient and sustainable. Machine learning models have become increasingly popular due to advancements in computational techniques and the availability of large amounts of data [2]. However, a critical challenge in these models is the effective selection of relevant features that enhance the accuracy and robustness of the predictions. To address this issue, we have implemented a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for optimal feature selection. The study first trains the model to determine the best features from the dataset with the help of GA; afterward, these features are fed into a stacking-based ensemble model for further training and evaluation. At its core, energy demand forecasting may be broken down into two distinct ways: traditional methods and more modern machine learning-based techniques [3, 4]. Conventional methods include statistical analysis, Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Exponential Smoothing (EA), and regression-based approaches [5]. These methods have proven effective for linear problems. On the other hand, machine learning methods are adept at handling non-linear scenarios. Notable among these are Random Forest (RF) [6], Decision Tree (DT) [7], and Support Vector Machines (SVM) [8], which have been utilized for energy demand forecasting, as discussed in recent studies. However, it is important to note that while machine learning models offer substantial advantages in time series prediction, they are also susceptible to limitations, such as the potential for becoming trapped in local minima, particularly if hyperparameters are not optimally tuned. Several diverse methods have been developed for forecasting future energy consumption, from the very short term (minutes) to the very long term (years) (weeks) [9, 10]. Accurately predicting energy demand is crucial; an overestimation can lead to unnecessary conversion of excess energy, which is costly in terms of time, money, and resources, while underestimation may result in blackouts from supply line overloads. Typically, forecasting is divided into three categories based on the prediction horizon: short-term load forecasting (from an hour to a week), medium-term load forecasting (from a month to a year), and long-term load forecasting (beyond a year) [11]. Prediction of short-term loads is a major challenge. Indeed, schedules may be created to determine the distribution of generating resources, operational limits, environmental restrictions, and equipment usage restrictions with the help of accurate and dependable predictions [12]. In addition, the power systems may be optimized more using these predictions for the expected load condition in the future. Key contributions of this paper are as follows: The evolution of the paper is organized as follows. After the introduction, the related work of the study has been explained in Section 2. Section 3 discusses the methodology used in this study. The experimental setup for the training of our model is then described in Section 4. Our proposed framework is presented in Section 5. The obtained results are carefully examined and discussed in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 presents a summary of the key findings, discusses their implications, and suggests directions for further investigation. Electricity distribution networks are foundational to long-term prosperity and societal advancement. Power consumption forecasts must always be accurate and efficient when developing energy predictions for the dynamic electricity sector. In the dynamic electricity sector, power consumption forecasts must be both precise and efficient. Over recent decades, a myriad of methods for predicting future energy demand has emerged [13, 14]. Typically, these methods employ time series datasets of past energy usage to construct forecasting models [15]. The majority of the approaches presented for predicting a building’s energy usage may be broken down into two classes: statistical and artificial intelligence-based. For forecasting and analyzing energy use in the future, statistical approaches use the available historical data to build probabilistic models. ARIMA, ARMA, and ARIMAX are well-known statistical methods that have been used to predict future energy consumption. However, AI-driven approaches can improve forecasting accuracy due to their ability to identify non-linear trends in time series data [16]. Despite the widespread use of feature selection techniques like correlation-based, filter, and wrapper methods in research, there remains a significant opportunity to incorporate more sophisticated techniques to refine these predictions further. LSTM networks have demonstrated promising results in time series analysis [17]. Older variants of RNNs, such as Recurrent Backpropagation, require a very long time to learn and store the information over an extended period. To address these challenges, Hochreiter et al. [18] developed a gradient-based method called LSTM neural network [19], which is the extended version of a recurrent neural network. LSTM networks have both long-term memory and short-term memory, and it reduces the problem of exploding and vanishing gradient. Numerous researchers have leveraged the LSTM network to forecast energy demand. Bouktif et al. [20] integrated various machine learning models along with LSTM to develop a model for short-term load demand of energy. In another study, the authors [21] presented a statistical model, SARIMA, to predict hourly wind speed in the coastal area of Scotland. They utilized three-time series datasets collected from different elevations. The accuracy of the forecasting model can be enhanced by using a combination of the homogeneous or heterogeneous models. Li et al. [22] considered this benefit and proposed a multi-energy forecasting method for energy systems using a fusion of a Convolutional Neural Network and GRU (CNN-GRU) with transfer learning on a parallel architecture. The performance of the model was further refined through hyperparameter tuning, leading to more accurate results. A summary of notable studies on demand forecasting is provided in Table 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.t001 Significant progress has been made in enhancing energy demand forecasting using deep learning models. However, a gap remains in optimizing feature selection within these models. To address this gap, we propose a two-tiered approach. The first step involves applying a genetic algorithm to identify and select the most influential features. In the subsequent step, we employ a stacking ensemble method that combines the strengths of multiple predictive models. This synergistic approach not only refines the feature set but also integrates various models to substantially improve the accuracy of energy demand forecasts. Numerous studies have explored data-driven techniques due to their ability to predict loads and energy consumption across various scenarios [33]. The standard data-driven approach typically minimizes the sum of squared vertical distances to determine the optimal parameters [34]. A widely used method is linear regression [35], which identifies the best-fitting straight line across the training data. In addition to the linear model, ridge regression penalizes the extreme values of the weighted matrix to deal with multi-collinearity [36]. There has been a noticeable improvement in the development and interpretation of these linear regression models. An example of a non-parametric model is the K-nearest neighbor, in which the forecast is just the mean of all the neighbors [37]. With the optimal parameter settings, this method provides accurate outcomes for electrical load forecasting; it is also relatively easy to understand and implement in practice. Rather than relying on a single decision tree, which can lead to overfitting, ensemble models employ a network of decision trees to make predictions, such as additional trees and random forests. Gradient boosting further enhances tree accuracy by employing an ensemble of weak learners that assign greater weight to misclassified predictions [38]. The objective of this study is to develop an advanced method for predicting energy consumption. This is accomplished by integrating deep learning models using a stacking ensemble approach with a feature selection process optimized through a genetic algorithm (GA). With GA, our goal is to find the optimal Chromosome C*, that maximizes Fitness (C) as given in Eq (1) (1) Where C = [c1, c2, ……, cn] is the chromosome, and ci is a binary variable indicating the inclusion (1) or exclusion (0) of feature i. With stacking, our goal is to minimize the loss function using the feature subset X' chosen by the GA and forecasts generated by the stacking model given in Eq (2) (2) Here Mj(X') represents the prediction output of the j-th model, and S is the stacking layer function that aggregates the prediction from the individual models. In summary, the GA enhances the quality of the model input by optimizing the feature space, whereas the stacked model utilizes the advantages of numerous deep learning architectures to provide reliable prediction outputs. In this subsection, we outline the key challenges in energy demand forecasting and explain how our proposed method effectively addresses each challenge. The high-dimensional nature of datasets in energy demand forecasting presents a significant challenge in selecting the most relevant features [39]. This task is computationally intensive and often includes redundant or irrelevant features, which can degrade model performance. This study employs a GA to search for the optimal subset of features systematically. The GA uses a fitness function based on the inverse of Mean Squared Error to evaluate predictive accuracy given in Eq (3) (3) Where C is a chromosome representing a subset of features. A crucial challenge in energy demand forecasting is preventing overfitting by ensuring the model works effectively with unknown data. Overfitting occurs when the model captures noise in the training data, resulting in poor performance on new data [40]. By using the GA to determine the most informative features, our approach improves the model’s generalizability. The high-dimensional feature spaces might result in longer training times and more resource use due to the computational complexity. This challenge is significant in practical applications where computing efficiency is the highest priority. Our genetic algorithm-based approach addresses this difficulty by decreasing the number of features. The GA progressively improves the feature subset, reducing input space that retains the most significant features. Let n be the original number of features and k the number of selected features after GA optimization, where k < n. In this section, we provide a concise overview of the methodologies employed in this study. This section presents an introduction to the basics of time series analysis. To get a more thorough analysis of time series analysis, we suggest reading [41, 42]. Time Series (TS) analysis is a valuable tool for studying energy demand patterns, which inherently vary over time due to their time-dependent nature. It involves applying statistical or artificial intelligence methods to predict future trends by analyzing previously collected information. A time series composed of P real-valued data points a1, …., aP each ai (where 1 ≤ i ≤ P) signifies the value recorded at the time i. The task of time series forecasting can be described as predicting future values az+1, …. az+k based on the preceding a1, …, az values (where z + k ≤ P). The goal here is to reduce the difference between the forecasted value and the actual value az+j (for 1 ≤ j ≤ k). In this context, ‘z’ represents the historical window, indicating the number of past data points considered for making predictions, and ‘k’ denotes the prediction horizon, which is the extent of the future we aim to predict. Time series analysis has been applied in a wide range of real-life applications such as Anomaly detection [43], financial indices [44], Healthcare [45], Weather prediction, and energy consumption [46]. In contrast to traditional approaches, which focus on parametric-based models, namely auto-regressive, Moving Average, and structural TS [47], the Artificial intelligence-based model offers purely data-driven approaches. GA are adaptive heuristic search algorithms based on the evolutionary ideas of natural selection and genetics [48]. With this technique, our goal is to identify the subset of features that contributes the most to the predictive power of a given model. In this study, we employed the DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python) library, which provides a flexible and customizable framework for creating genetic algorithms. Below is a detailed description of the GA process for feature selection. Let C = [c1, c2, ……, cn ] be a chromosome, where n is the number of features and ci is a binary variable indicating the inclusion (1) or exclusion (0) of feature i. The fitness of an individual is evaluated based on the performance of the model using the selected subset of features. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used as the fitness metric presented in Eq (4). The goal is to find the optimal chromosome C* that maximizes Fitness (C) Formally: The steps employed for determining the best features are shown in Fig 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g001 The GA identifies the best subset of features from the dataset, which includes historical energy consumption, weather variables, and temporal features, by exploring various combinations to maximize predictive accuracy. The GA reduces redundancy and noise by choosing only the most relevant features, resulting in more accurate and robust model training. This optimized feature set enhances the model’s performance, allowing it to generalize better from training data to unseen data, as shown by improved Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics. Furthermore, reducing the number of features decreases computational complexity, leading to faster training times without sacrificing accuracy. Ensemble models have gained popularity in recent years mainly because of the great outcomes they produce on various tasks, such as classification and regression issues [49]. These techniques include the combination of multiple models of learning to enhance the performance of each model individually. Ensemble learning was first explored in the 1990s when it proved that many weak learners could be turned into strong learners. Typically, two stages are involved in this process. Initially, a variety of base learners are developed from the training data. Subsequently, these learners are combined in the second stage to create a cohesive prediction model. This results in multiple forecasts derived from individual base learners being merged into a more effective composite model, which typically outperforms each of the base models. Consolidating several effective individual models into a single enhanced model usually results in greater predictive accuracy. Bagging, boosting, and stacking are the three most popular and well-known fundamental ensemble approaches [50]. In bagging, multiple models are created, with each model’s results given equal weight, and a voting method determines the most common outcome. For regression, the mean of predictions is typically used. Boosting, similar to bagging, differs by assigning varying weights to models, with the final result being a weighted vote. In regression contexts, this means a weighted average. On the other hand, Stacking employs different algorithms for model building, followed by a combiner algorithm that uses these models’ outputs to make final predictions. Any ensemble approach can be used as the combiner in stacking. Ensemble learning techniques have been applied in various time series forecasting methods, including energy demand. Zhang et al. [51] introduced an extreme learning machine (ELM) method utilized in the electricity market. Tan et al. [52] combined wavelet transform with ARIMA and GARCH models for price forecasting in Spanish and PJM electricity markets. In another study, authors [49] developed an ensemble model using Bayesian Clustering by Dynamics (BCD) and SVM, which was tested on New York City’s historical load data. Later, Tasnim et al. [21] created an ensemble framework based on the cluster for predicting wind power, employing regression models on wind data from various Australian locations. LSTM is a specific form of RNN structure developed to tackle the challenge of the vanishing gradient problem and efficiently capture the patterns in sequential data [53]. This is achieved by utilizing a specialized gating mechanism that effectively controls the transmission of information within the network. A standard LSTM unit has three primary gates, as shown in Fig 2. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g002 where w and b are weights and biases and ⏀ represent activation function, which is sigmoid in our study. Uf is a weight matrix associated with the forget gate. Unlike standard LSTM, BiLSTM is able to learn from both the past and future as processes input in both directions. This feature enhances its capability to model sequential dependencies in language processing tasks. BiLSTM involves adding an additional LSTM layer that processes the input sequence in reverse. The outputs of both forward and backward layers are then merged using techniques like averaging, summing, multiplying, or concatenating. The unrolled BiLSTM structure is presented in Fig 3. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g003 The forward and backward propagation output of the above diagram has been shown below: Eqs (11), (12), and (13). Where x, h, and c are the input state, hidden state, and temporary state. The GRU model demonstrates superior computational efficiency by employing a lower number of training parameters. As a result, memory utilization and training times are reduced. The simpler architecture, consisting of two gates, Eqs (14) and (15), reduces the possibility of overfitting on smaller datasets. Moreover, the GRU shows improved stability during the training process, requiring reduced fine-tuning for hyperparameters. Fig 4 shows a simple GRU network. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g004 Update Gate (Zt): (14) Reset Gate (Rt): (15) where W are the weights, and σ represents the activation function. ht-1 are the hidden states. The stochastic nature of deep learning models such as LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, and GA, where random initializations and training processes can lead to variability in performance, makes it crucial to ensure the reliability and robustness of our results [54]. We conducted repeated simulations to address this, running each model 10 times with different random seeds. We recorded the performance metrics for each run, including MSE, MAE, MAPE, and RMSE. Eqs (18)–(21) provide the equations for these metrics. To statistically compare the performance metrics across different runs, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. This non-parametric test is suitable for comparing two related samples, matched samples, or repeated measurements on a single sample to assess whether their population mean ranks differ. The Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test does not assume normality, making it a robust choice for our analysis [55]. This test works by ranking the absolute differences between paired observations, assigning ranks, and then computing the sum of ranks for the positive and negative differences. The test statistic W is the smaller of these sums. The p-value is derived from the distribution of W under the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the paired samples. The Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test is calculated as follows: We collected the dataset containing information on net demand and consumption in the UK, covering the period from 2020 to 2023. While preparing the data, we apply techniques to handle missing data points, which are represented as NaN or null values within our dataset. To impute the missing values, we calculate the mean μ and median σ, that can effectively transform a feature set X from X = {x1, x2, …., xn} to , where x’i = xi if xi is not missing, and x'i = μ or σ otherwise. There are three categories of data transformation that are typically utilized in the neural network. In this model, we used linear transformation Eq (16), which scales the data either into (0 to 1) or (-1 to +1) range. In order to account for any differences in data behavior, the dataset is analyzed by classifying it according to temporal patterns, specifically by differentiating between weekdays and weekends. The entire dataset is divided into two parts. 80% of the data was chosen for training, while the remaining 20% was used for validation. Validation data is further refined by dividing data into four distinct samples (S1, S2, S3, S4), enabling a comprehensive evaluation that enhances the robustness and generalizability of findings. The dataset contains a total of 43 features, out of which, after applying GA, we got the four highly correlated features with the target feature for the training for our model. We have done exploratory analysis on these features to get better insights about the data. We separate a single feature on which we wish to make the prediction. In our case, it is Net Demand. We need to scale this feature, so we used the MinMaxScaler library of Python. The dataset did not contain any missing values. The two-month training graph shows a strong daily cyclical pattern with daytime peaks and nighttime drops, as shown in Fig 5. Energy demand ranges between 17,500 and 35,000 daily, showing no long-term trend. The graph’s density shows high-frequency data collection, providing an in-depth view of energy consumption trends with potential outliers from demand drops. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g005 We further illustrated the variations in net energy demand over weekdays and weekends in April and May 2023. It is possible to see a pattern of highs and lows that repeats itself every day, with times when demand rises and times when it falls. Demand changes a lot during the week, with higher levels of consumption during the day and lower levels of demand at night. This repetitive behavior can also be seen on the weekends, but the volume isn’t as strong. This could be because people use the system differently when they don’t have to work during the week Fig 6. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g006 Additionally, we used box plots to examine the distribution of energy generation features between weekdays and weekends. The visual representations shown in Fig 7 clearly illustrate a noticeable difference in the core tendencies and variabilities of the two temporal segments. The interquartile ranges shown indicate a greater level of uniformity in energy production patterns on weekdays compared to weekends, especially in the ‘GENERATION’ and ‘FOSSIL’ categories. Outliers, identified by the data points located outside the whiskers of the box plots, were present in both categories, indicating occasional deviations from the usual energy production levels. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g007 In this study, we have adopted a stacking approach for the regression problem, considering it the most appropriate, as discussed in [56]. The general structure of this method is illustrated in Fig 8. To define the stacking ensemble scheme more precisely, given P distinct learning algorithms Mh, for k = 1 to P, and the data pair 〈a, b〉 {a = (a1, …., az) representing the recorded z values and b = (az+1, …., az+k) k values to be predicted}, let , (for h = 1 to P, j = 1 to k) be the model generated by Mh to forecast az+j. The function gj, which combines these models for prediction, can be a standard function developed through another algorithm utilizing a machine learning system. The predicted value is then calculated using this method, Eq (17). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g008 In this work, we have employed and optimized various hyperparameters, such as Epoch, which represents a complete iteration of training data. Dropout mitigated the issue of overfitting. The learning rate refers to the pace at which the model updates its parameters during training. Batch size, on the other hand, represents the number of samples processed by the network at each iteration. The hidden layer, positioned between the input and output layers, determines the number of nodes it should contain. In order to optimize GPU utilization, we have implemented a batch size of 12. Additionally, we have chosen a dropout rate of 0.2 to mitigate overfitting. The dropout rate is 0.2. By removing 20% of the nodes in the hidden layer, we effectively minimize the occurrence of overfitting. The learning rate should not be very low; hence, the learning rate is adjusted to 0.1. After all these adjustments, we achieved a reduction in the mean squared error (MSE) to a level below 0.01, as shown in Fig 9. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g009 The efficacy of our study was evaluated using several variables [57]. The following procedures were used for each, and we have shown in these equations in Eqs (18), (19), (20), and (21) The accuracy of a model is calculated from MAPE. Our proposed method includes a multi-step process that starts with data preparation and culminates with evaluating the predictions. Technically, a common preprocessing formula for data preprocessing and feature selections is presented in Eqs (22) and (23), Here, D is the original dataset, Dp is the preprocessed dataset, and ∅ is the preprocessing function that includes data cleaning, transformation, normalization, and temporal feature extraction. Here Fs is the set of selected features, and GA is the Genetic Algorithm applied to Dp for feature selection. We deploy three base deep learning models, LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU, which we have already discussed in section 3.3. The LSTM model is adept at capturing long-term dependencies, the BiLSTM model leverages information from both past and future time points, and the GRU model efficiently models short-term dependencies shown in Eqs (24)–(26). Here, ht represents the hidden state at time t. The hidden states of each base learner are combined using a stacking ensemble approach with a linear regression meta-learner presented in Eqs (27) and (28), respectively. Here, H is the concatenated hidden states from each base learner, is the predicted energy demand, and β0, β1, β2, β3 are the coefficients learned by the meta-learner. When the whole procedure is expressed as an equation, it can be written as in Eq (29) (29) Fig 10 demonstrates the entire process of the proposed framework. The model comprises several stages. A thorough preprocessing procedure is applied to the dataset, which includes data cleaning to fix errors, data transformation to organize the information for analysis, variable standardization to make them more comparable, and temporal feature extraction to take advantage of trends that change over time. After the preprocessing is completed, a genetic algorithm is then used for feature selection. This computational evolution approach uses mutation and crossover to enhance the prediction skills of the feature set population, mimicking natural selection. The whole GA process is shown in Fig 1. We evaluate the fitness of each feature set based on how well it predicts energy use. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g010 In the model implementation phase, three separate recurrent neural networks—GRU, BiLSTM, and LSTM—are trained as the base models using the features that GA selected. We used a stacking ensemble approach to best use each neural network’s capabilities. A meta-model is trained in this ensemble to merge the forecasts of the GRU, BiLSTM, and LSTM basis models into a single, more precise prediction. In the last stage, statistical matrices such as MSE, MAE, MAPE, and RMSE are used to measure the accuracy of forecasts and conduct a thorough evaluation of this composite model’s performance. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated through multiple metrics, namely RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. Detailed mathematical formulations for these evaluation metrics are provided in Section 4.6. In the dataset analyzed for this study, two distinct energy demand patterns were identified, as shown in Fig 6. The first pattern is associated with weekends, where a notable decrease in energy demand is observed. In contrast, the second pattern corresponds to weekdays, characterized by a consistent increase in energy demand. The data was systematically categorized according to these patterns, and the model was then trained to handle them effectively. The results of this comparative analysis are displayed in Fig 11 for the weekday pattern and in Fig 12 for the weekend pattern. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g011 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g012 After training the architecture presented in this study using the data patterns illustrated in Fig 6, we first tested the model on the training dataset. The outcomes of this test are detailed in Table 2. To further our objective, we then evaluated the model’s performance using a hidden validation dataset from the energy demand data. The results of this evaluation are shown in Table 3. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.t002 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.t003 An additional performance assessment was also conducted by dividing the entire validation dataset into four distinct samples. The model’s performance was then re-evaluated on each of these samples separately. The outcomes of these evaluations are documented in Fig 13 and Table 4. Actual vs predicted graph for all four samples (S1, S2, S3, S4). Actual vs predicted graph for all four samples (S1, S2, S3, S4). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g013 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.t004 In the final analysis, individual models using LSTM, GRU, and BiLSTM architectures were developed for the identified demand patterns. Their comparative performance is illustrated in Fig 14. LSTM ‐ (a) for weekend. (a’) for weekdays. BiLSTM ‐ (b) for weekdays, (b’) for weekend. GRU ‐ (c) for weekdays, (c’) for weekend. LSTM ‐ (a) for weekend. (a’) for weekdays. BiLSTM ‐ (b) for weekdays, (b’) for weekend. GRU ‐ (c) for weekdays, (c’) for weekend. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g014 In Table 4, we provide a comprehensive evaluation, presenting the overall performance scores of all models across the four validation samples. Deep learning models are inherently stochastic, which means that they can produce different results on different executions. To demonstrate the reliability of our proposed model, we executed the entire program ten times. For each run, we recorded the error metrics, as shown in Tables 5 and 6. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.t005 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.t006 To determine if the differences in performance metrics across different runs were statistically significant, we applied the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. The results are summarized in Table 7. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.t007 The p-values indicate whether there is a significant difference between the models’ performances over multiple runs. A p-value less than 0.05 typically indicates a significant difference. In this case, the p-values for all comparisons (Ensemble vs. LSTM, Ensemble vs. BiLSTM, and Ensemble vs. GRU) across all metrics (MSE, MAE, RMSE, MAPE) are 0.001953125, which is significantly less than the 0.05 threshold. This demonstrates that the ensemble model consistently shows a statistically significant improvement in performance over the individual models. The prediction accuracy criteria for assessment are schematically shown in Fig 15. Most of the error lies around zero. Therefore, mathematical findings confirm the predicted accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed approach. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g015 The findings indicate that the Stacking-GA model consistently achieves better results compared to the separate deep learning models in all criteria during both weekdays and weekends. In Sample S1 on weekdays, the Stacking-GA model had the lowest MAE (494.62) for weekdays Fig 16(A), and MAE (534.25) for weekends Fig 16(B), which indicates its improved predictive accuracy compared to the solo models. Similarly, the observed trend is stable in all samples, suggesting that the ensemble technique successfully captures the fundamental patterns in energy consumption. MAE score of LSTM, GRU, BiLSM, and Stacking-GA based model for both (a) weekdays and (b) weekends. MAE score of LSTM, GRU, BiLSM, and Stacking-GA based model for both (a) weekdays and (b) weekends. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g016 The RMSE values, which indicate the level of volatility in the predictions, drop in the following order: LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, and Stacking-GA. This further highlights the resilience of the ensemble approach. Furthermore, the MAPE shown in Fig 17(A) and 17(B), and RMSE shown in Fig 18(A) and 18(B) provide additional evidence supporting the enhanced precision and dependability of the Stacking-GA model. The performance difference amongst the models is particularly evident on weekends, possibly indicating the enhanced challenge of predicting energy demand during these periods due to less predictable consumption patterns.

MAPE score of LSTM, GRU, BiLSM, and Stacking-GA based model for both (a) weekdays and (b) weekends. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g017 RMSE score of LSTM, GRU, BiLSM, and Stacking-GA based model for both (a) weekdays and (b) weekends. RMSE score of LSTM, GRU, BiLSM, and Stacking-GA based model for both (a) weekdays and (b) weekends. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g018 In summary, the Stacking-GA model demonstrates a significant improvement in prediction accuracy compared to individual deep learning models such as LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU. Due to the stochastic nature of these models, we conducted repeated simulations, running each model ten times with different random seeds and recording the performance metrics (MSE, MAE, RMSE, MAPE) for each run. To ensure the reliability of our results, we used the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test to compare the performance metrics across the different runs. The Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test results, with p-values of 0.001953125 for all comparisons, indicate a statistically significant improvement in the performance of the ensemble model over the individual models across all metrics. The enhanced performance in energy demand forecasting is likely attributed to the combination of feature selection, ensemble learning, and the incorporation of a Genetic Algorithm. The ensemble deep learning framework proposed in this study has significant implications and potential applications in real-world energy demand forecasting scenarios. It provides accurate and robust forecasts, which are crucial for various stakeholders in the energy section. The ensemble framework, which combines the LSTM, BiLST, and GRU models, improves the accuracy of energy demand predictions. Better accuracy is crucial for utility firms, grid operators, and policymakers to make well-informed choices about energy generation, distribution, and management. Our method is adaptable to various forecasting horizons, whether short-term, medium-term, or long-term. This adaptability makes it suitable for different applications, such as day-ahead forecasting for grid operation, week-ahead forecasting for maintenance scheduling, and long-term forecasting for infrastructure planning. The use of a GA for feature selection allows the framework to handle complex and high-dimensional data efficiently. This capability is particularly useful in scenarios where large amounts of data from smart meters, weather stations, and other sources need to be processed to generate accurate forecasts. With developments in real-time data collecting and processing technology, our ensemble framework may be integrated into smart grid systems to give real-time energy demand forecasts. This has the potential to increase energy distribution efficiency and reliability while also making it easier to integrate distributed energy resources. This research presents a significant advancement in energy demand forecasting by introducing an innovative stacking ensemble approach. The integration of LSTM, GRU, and BiLSTM networks, underpinned by a genetic algorithm for feature selection, marks a novel methodology in addressing the complexities of energy demand prediction. We have also utilized the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test for statistical validation and ran the simulations ten times to ensure our results hold up. The performance evaluation was conducted using three key metrics: RMSE, MAPE, and MAE. To ensure the model’s robustness against the variability in energy consumption patterns, the data was segmented into weekday and weekend categories for analysis. The results from the validation data highlight the model’s exceptional precision, with a weekday performance marked by an RMSE of 130.6, a MAPE of 0.38%, and an MAE of 99.41. For weekend projections, the model maintained its accuracy, recording an RMSE of 137.41, a MAPE of 0.42%, and an MAE of 105.67. This level of precision indicates the model’s effectiveness in capturing the complexities of energy demand patterns. Additionally, The use of a genetic algorithm for feature selection has proven to be a key factor in the model’s success. It efficiently identifies the most influential predictors, improving the model’s performance. Furthermore, The stacking-based ensemble model, integrating multiple deep learning techniques, showcases a robust framework that outperforms traditional single-model approaches in forecasting accuracy. The study not only contributes to the theoretical understanding of feature selection in machine learning but also offers practical implications for energy analysts and policymakers. Enhancing the accuracy of energy demand forecasts aids in efficient energy management and planning, which is crucial in the context of growing energy needs and sustainability challenges.

The rupee extended its recovery for the second straight session and settled with a gain of 13 paise at 86.40 (provisional) against the US dollar on Wednesday, tracking favourable cues from domestic equity markets and softening crude oil prices. - PTI WhatsApp Image 2025-01-15 at 15.38.55.jpeg According to Motilal Oswal Private Wealth (MOPW), Indian markets are expected to remain volatile in the first half of 2025 due to several global and domestic events, including the new Trump administration’s policies, China’s measures to counter trade tariffs and its possible implications for EM currencies, and the upcoming Indian Union budget. These events are anticipated to create uncertainty in the near term. However, as these events unfold and greater clarity emerges, market volatility is expected to subside in the latter half of the year. Despite the recent slowdown in GDP, MOPW remains optimistic about India’s growth due to its macroeconomic stability, supported by significant foreign exchange reserves and a regulated twin deficit. It expects GDP growth to improve compared to the modest growth reported in Q2 FY25. Ashish Shanker, MD & CEO of MOPW says, “The post covid period has been extremely rewarding to equity investors driven by earnings growth, improving macros and domestic inflows into equities. The year 2024 has been no different with broader markets doing extremely well. The mid cap and small cap segment have outperformed the large caps. Gold has also done well as an asset class. The year 2025 will bring its share of uncertainty as the new US president gets sworn in. After years of good performance the US markets also looks tired. This calls for moderation in expectations and a sharp focus on risk management through asset allocation” After tepid corporate earnings and slow GDP growth in Q2FY25, MOPW recommends closely monitoring the upcoming earnings season and GDP growth trajectory.. We expect this trend to reverse and expect large caps to do better this year given the valuation comfort. In the longer term, earning growth and stock returns should converge. Considering this, it seems small cap stocks have run up way ahead of earnings growth in most of the segments. MOPW expects this trend to reverse and large caps to do better this year given the valuation comfort.

Read more Gold prices steadied in yesterday’s session, as market participants digested latest US inflation data as well as a report on President-elect Donald Trump’s planned trade tariffs. US producer prices rose at a slower-than-anticipated rate in December, increasing by 0.2% on a month-on-month basis, below 0.4% pace seen in November. Sticky inflation and strength in the labor market could provide the Federal Reserve more headroom to keep interest rates high. Trump’s team is preparing a plan for a gradual imposition of trade tariffs in the coming months, although it was unclear whether the President-elect will follow through on the plan. The plan will involve tariff increases of between 2% to 5% every month, and will give Washington more leverage in trade negotiations, while also preventing a sudden spike in inflation due to the duties. Despite lower PPi, dollar index continues to hold its strength hovering around its two year highs, market participants will keep an eye on the US CPI data scheduled later today.

Perspective by Ravi Hirwani, Senior Vice-President, Bhailal Amin General Hospital, Vadodara, on expectations from the upcoming Union Budget “The Indian healthcare sector is at a pivotal junction of growth. Certain measures announced by the government can further amplify it. The ecosystem needs to be re-engineered to empower rural counterparts with robust, tech-forward healthcare and medical solutions. Complex ailments like cancer and heart issues burden the ecosystem. There is a shortage of medical specialists, and the need for healthcare infrastructure development in the country’s rural counterpart. The sector needs strategic reforms from both operational and financial perspectives. We request the honorable Finance Minister to increase the allocation by 3% spending of the total GDP to the healthcare sector. Further, the removal or reduction of customs duties on medical devices and cancer-related drugs & devices. The government must consider giving the healthcare sector an infrastructure status that will help private players to reap the benefit and expand operations, especially in smaller cities. An incentivization scheme for expansion in Tier-2 and below cities and the adoption of technology will help the sector flourish in the long run. Hospitals must be allowed to avail the benefits of input tax credit that will help bring a control on treatment costs effectively, thus creating a win-win situation for both industry players and residents alike. The country must aim for dual-dimensional growth by catering for the residents as well as foreign nationals and to address this, we request the government to introduce special packages and measures for foreign nationals seeking to take treatment in India. This will further accentuate the positioning of India as one of the most sought-after destinations for medical tourism.” Smartlink Holdings Ltd has informed the exchange about sanction of the amalgamation scheme between Smartlink Holdings and Synegra EMS Ltd by the National Company Law Tribunal.

In the US, Producer prices increased 0.2% mom (+3.3% YoY) in Dec-24, below 0.4% in November which was the biggest gain in five months, and compared to forecasts of 0.3% (+3.4% YoY). Meanwhile, the core PPI was unchanged, following a 0.2% rise (+3.5%YoY) in Nov and compared to forecasts of 0.3% (+3.8%YoY). On the fiscal front in the U.S. government posted an $87 billion budget deficit in December, reduced partly by a shift of benefit payments into November but capping a record $711 billion deficit for the first three months of the 2025 fiscal year, On the domestic front, India’s wholesale prices increased by 2.37% yoy in December 2024, accelerating from a 1.89% rise in November, slightly above forecasts of a 2.30% gain. This was due to faster rises in manufacturing prices amid a softer fall in fuel prices. Primary articles saw faster growth (6.02% vs 5.49% in Nov), and manufacturing prices accelerated to a 23-month high (2.14% vs 2.00%). In view of ongoing political crisis in Bangladesh, India aims to boost its textile and garments industry in next month’s budget with financial support, tariff cuts on key inputs and incentives to produce locally, two government sources said. The government may also raise the allocation for production-linked incentives for the textile sector to around 600 million rupees from 450 million rupees for the current fiscal year, the source said. Moreover the government is likely to forecast nominal economic growth of 10.3 per cent-10.5 per cent, according to one of the officials. That’s higher than the forecast of 9.7 per cent for the current year to end-March given by the government’s statistical department this month.

The IPO that comes out with a price band of ₹407-428 a share saw a tremendous response from non-institutional investors including retail by subscribing 16 times. The minimum lot size is 33 shares. Equity markets are expected to sustain their gains at open. Gift Nifty at 23,310 signals a marginal gain of about 50 points at open. However, analysts expect the market to remain volatile and remain under pressure given the unabated selling by foreign portfolio investors. Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Research, Wealth Management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, said: positive domestic factors include a decline in retail inflation to a four-month low of 5.2 per cent, IIP growth improving in November 2024 to 5.17 per cent and the RBI Governor’s indication of a more flexible rupee policy, contributing to improved market sentiment. “While there is short-term relief in the market, overall weak global cues, a fall in the rupee, low earnings growth and FII outflows continue to weigh on sentiment, keeping the overall outlook cautious,” he added. Read more The last month of the year 2024 was quite eventful even though Indian bond yields continued to trade in a narrow range. INR was the centre of attention as it come under increasing pressure in the latter part of December on back of continuous rise in the dollar index as it surged 2.60% during the month. INR depreciated by 1.32% against the US dollar, touching a lifetime low of 85.82 on an intraday basis before a marginal pullback on RBI intervention led to monthly and yearly closing at 85.61. The dollar index climbed above 108, ending the month at 108.49. December started on an optimistic note for the bond markets as markets started to factor in a higher probability of a policy rate cut in the December 6th Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting after the much slower-than-expected Q2 FY25 GDP growth data released on 29th Nov 2024. The MPC kept all the policy rates on hold while RBI reduced the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) by 50bps. The reduction in CRR released Rs. 1.16 lac cr of liquidity in the banking system, which was struggling with tight liquidity on account of heavy RBI intervention in the FX markets along with advance tax and GST outflows. The MPC decision’s to hold policy rates was taken with a 4-2 majority with Dr. Nagesh Kumar and Professor Ram Singh voting for a 25bps cut in the policy repo rate. The monetary policy stance of “Neutral” was retained unanimously. The MPC revised both its Inflation and Growth forecast for FY25, pegging down the GDP forecast at 6.60% from 7.20% earlier and increasing the Inflation forecast to 4.80% for FY25 from 4.50% earlier. RBI remains optimistic on GDP growth in H2FY25 after the negative surprise of Q2. The tone of the policy was balanced with emphasis on durable price stability. There was change of guard at the RBI as Sanjay Malhotra, the incumbent revenue secretary took over as the 26th Governor of RBI replacing Shaktikanta Das who was at the helm for six years. CPI Inflation came in line with expectations at 5.48% with core inflation remaining stead at 3.70%. Food Inflation moderated but remained high at 8.2% YOY. WPI Inflation cooled to 1.90% in November compared to 2.40% in October led by moderation in food prices. WPI has averaged 2.10% so far in this fiscal, compared to a corresponding period average of -1.30% in FY2023. WPI “core” Inflation came in at 0.50% compared to 0.30% in October, though remined below 1% for the fourth consecutive month. Trade deficit hit an all-time high of USD 37.9 bn for November as imports led by gold imports hitting an all-time high of USD 70 bn. Couple of days after the release of the trade data , there were news reports of some error in the data and the government thinking about setting up a team to double check on the data. The current account deficit came in steady at 1.20% of GDP for QE September 24, compared to 1.10% of GDP in the quarter ending June 24. Capital account remained in surplus at USD 30 bn and the overall BOP surplus came in at USD 18.60 bn in QE September from USD 5.20 bn in the previous quarter. The current account deficit is likely to expand in the December quarter. Tax collections remains robust with the third quarter advance tax payment at Rs 3.15 lakh crore, compared with Rs 2.7 lakh crore a year ago. Net direct tax collections (net of refunds) rose 16.45% YOY to INR 15.82 lac crore, which consisted of INR 7.42 lac crore of corporate tax and INR 7.97 lac crore of non-corporate tax collection with STT collections at INR 40,000 crore. The finance ministry, in its economic review for November, expressed optimism regarding a growth rebound in H2 of FY25 by projecting a GDP growth of 6.50% for FY25. The report also mentioned that the “combination of monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures by the central bank may have contributed to the demand slowdown”. This is being seen as putting some pressure on RBI to support growth by reducing rates. Interbank liquidity remained pretty tight even after the reduction in CRR, leading to sharp uptick in money market yields of up to 1 Yr maturity. 3 month maturity CD yields were trading close to 7.40%-7.45% levels, higher by 20-25 bps, compared to the September quarter and the 1 Yr maturity CD’s were trading at 7.65%-7.70%. Bond yields inched higher by 2-3 bps across the curve, with the benchmark 10 Yr bond yield ending the month at 6.76%, up by 2 bps compared to last month’s closing of 6.74%. OIS curve steepened as the 5 Yr OIS yield was higher by 16 bps, ending the month at 6.20%. 1 Yr OIS ended the month at 6.51%, up by 10 bps on the month. FPI flows revived in December with debt flows at USD 1.40 bn, taking the total FPI flows into debt for CY2024 to USD 18 bn. Banking deposit growth has exceeded the credit growth this fiscal with the banking system deposits growing by 7.80%, compared to the credit growth of 7.00% in FY25 so far. Globally, bond remined under pressure with the US Fed delivering a hawkish rate cut as it reduced its forecast of rate cuts for 2025. The US Fed lowered its rate cut forecast for 2025 to 2 rate cuts from 4 earlier and also raised the inflation and the neutral rate forecast. BOJ stood pat on rates but it is expected that they will increase their policy rates twice in 2025. A hawkish Fed coupled with the challenging debt situation in US, sticky inflation amidst robust GDP growth has led to a sharp rise in US bond yields in the last quarter. The benchmark US 10 Yr Bond yield ended the year at 4.57%, up by almost 90 bps over the last three months. The elevated US and global bond yields along with the rise in the dollar index has put pressure on emerging market currencies and bond yields. The dollar index has surged by 6.15% in CY2024 and the INR has depreciated by 2.88% in CY2024. RBI has intervened quite aggressively to contain INR depreciation and RBI is short almost USD 60 bn in the NDF market. India’s foreign currency reserves are down by USD 43 bn from its peak. The pressure on INR due to a strengthening US dollar and expectations of a rebound in the GDP growth in H2FY25 has reduced expectations of policy rate cut from RBI but we continue to expect RBI to cut policy rates starting from February 2025 onwards as Inflation is likely to moderate further. We also expect the external situation to stabilise gradually as markets seems to have factored in a lot of negatives. Bonds will continue to be supported on expectations of monetary easing and we expect yields to continue to drift lower gradually. Retracement in yields from current levels will offer a good opportunity to investors to increase their allocation to fixed income. PGIM India MF Outlook While there are some headwinds in terms of slowing earnings growth, lacklustre capex, INR depreciation and subdued consumption, we reckon some of the above may be transient and will resolve over time. Importantly, corporate debt/GDP are at lows, banks are well capitalised, capital markets are strong and hence there is enough fuel available for long-term productive asset creation which keeps India’s growth story intact. We are mindful of geopolitical actions in terms of tariffs and rate cuts which could result in measures being taken by impacted countries and that needs to be closely monitored. We believe that despite global challenges, India continues to be the fastest-growing economy among major nations, reflecting its resilience. Factors such as sustained domestic economic growth, political stability, prudent reforms, infrastructure investment, healthy corporate finances, ample foreign reserves, controlled twin deficits, stable crude prices, and lower commodity inflation protect India from external shocks and position it for future growth. We are optimistic on investments in high-growth and good-quality companies with a medium to long-term investment horizon. The Market that was The NIFTY 50 declined 2% in December after a flattish November, but gained 8.8% in CY2024. Mid Cap and Small Cap indices outperformed the Large Cap index and were up 1.4% and 0.6% in December and 23.9% each (both Mid Cap and Small Cap indices) in CY2024. Sector-wise, healthcare and realty were the best-performing sectors in the month of December and in 2024. Power, metals and PSU indices declined 7%, 5.4% and 5.2% in December. Rupee was down 1.3% at INR 85.6 vs USD and India 10 Yr yields rose by 6 bps during the month to 6.81%. FPIs bought USD 59 mn of Indian equities in the secondary market, whereas DIIs bought USD 4 bn. FIIs net sold USD 170mn in CY24. On the other hand, DIIs have continued to remain net buyers to the tune of USD 62 bn in CY24. Within DIIs, mutual funds have been the key buyers, contributing to USD 50bn buying. On the economy front, November CPI decelerated to 5.5% YoY from 6.2% in October and back to September levels of 5.5% due to correction in food prices. Sequentially, inflation eased by -15 bps vs. 134 bps hike in the previous month. Core CPI (ex-food and fuel) remained stable at 3.8% as in the last month with sequential pace slowing to 20 bps vs. 59 bps in the last month. WPI also eased to 1.9% in November, compared to 2.4% in October. The index of industrial production (IIP) marginally improved and grew by 3.5% YoY in October vs. growth of 3.1% in September, buoyed by festival-driven demand, reversing a 0.1% contraction in August. Manufacturing/Electricity/Mining registered 4%/2%/1% YoY growth. 18/23 industries advanced YoY. Trade deficit in November further expanded to USD 38 bn (versus USD 27 bn in October and USD 20 bn in September), almost entirely led by a jump in gold imports from USD 7 bn in October to USD 16 bn in November. FY25 April-Nov’24 fiscal deficit touched 52.5% of budgeted estimates (BE) vs. 50.1% of the budgeted estimates same time last year. Direct tax collections are 12% higher YoY with personal income taxes higher by 24% YoY while corporate taxes are down 1% YoY. On the indirect tax side, collections are higher 9% YoY with higher customs growth offsetting weaker GST collections. YTD capex is only 46% of BE and -12% lower than last year. So far, capex has been concentrated in railways (67% of BE and -1% YoY), roads and transport (54% of BE and -16% YoY) while the other primary focus defence is lagging (42% of BE and -16% YoY). A monthly run rate of INR 642 bn so far and with four months to go gives a steep rate of INR 1494 bn (more than double of what has been clocked so far to achieve the budgeted estimates). System credit growth remained weak for the month of November at 10.6% YoY (Oct’24: 11.5% YoY) due to weak retail credit growth of 13.3% YoY (Oct’24: 12.9% YoY) and weak services credit growth of 13% YoY (Oct’24: 12.7% YoY). The weakness in growth is mainly due to stress in unsecured credit. Credit growth has largely converged with deposit growth which stood at 10.7% YoY driven by tightening of risk weights on unsecured loans and NBFC credit. INR4.5t Equity net inflows at record high in CY24 INR264.6b Amount garnered through SIPs at a new high INR66.9t MF industry’s AUM jumps 32% YoY According to Motilal Oswal Fund Folio Report, domestic MFs saw their equity AUM rise for the 11th consecutive year to INR33.4t (+40% YoY) in CY24. AUM growth was fueled by an uptrend in market indices (Nifty: +9% YoY) and higher equity scheme sales (at INR9,120b; +69% YoY). However, redemptions also rose 40% YoY to INR4,645b, leading to a rise in net inflows (more than double YoY) to INR4,475b in CY24 (all-time high) from INR2,063b in CY23. The MF industry’s total AUM increased 32% YoY (INR16.1t) to INR66.9t in CY24, propelled by the growth in equity funds (INR9,537b), liquid funds (INR1,727b), balanced funds (INR1,533b), other ETFs funds (INR1,424b), and income funds (INR954b). Investors continued to park their money in mutual funds, with inflows and contributions in systematic investment plans (SIPs) reaching a new high of INR264.6b in Dec’24 (up 4.5% MoM and 50.2% YoY).

The uptick was led by the fuel and power and primary non-food articles, which together accounted for as much as 42 bps of the 48 bps increase in the headline print between these months. The WPI food inflation remained unchanged at 8.9% in December 2024 vis-à-vis November 2024. Among food items, the inflation in vegetables and edible oils remained elevated, printing above the 25% mark in the month. The core (non-food manufacturing) WPI inflation inched up slightly to a five-month high of 0.7% in December 2024 from 0.5% in November 2024, while remaining below the 1.0%-mark for the fifth consecutive month. The prices of major vegetables, such as tomato, onion and potato, have declined quite sharply on a sequential basis in January 2025 so far. However, the relatively lower weight of vegetables in the WPI vis-à-vis the CPI, would limit the benefits on this account to the headline WPI inflation in the month. Moreover, the import duty hikes on most varieties of edible oil that were undertaken in mid-September 2024, are expected to continue to weigh on the year-on-year (YoY) WPI-food inflation print in January 2025. Consistently outperform Sensex over the past five fiscals1 New Delhi, January 14 2025: The benchmark of equity alternative investment funds (AIFs) investing in unlisted securities achieved a remarkable pooled internal rate of return (IRR) of 21.5% between fiscals 2013 and 2024, according to the second edition of the Crisil-Oister report, ‘No ifs about AIFs 2.0’. Across the past five fiscals, the benchmark outpaced the BSE Sensex Total Return Index (TRI), reaffirming the resilience and importance of private markets in India’s investment landscape. Stage-wise, the benchmark of early-stage funds generated a pooled IRR of 26.9% between fiscals 2013 and 2024, outperforming the BSE 250 Smallcap TRI by 4.29%. Similarly, the benchmark of growth and late-stage funds delivered a robust pooled IRR of 23.6% between fiscals 2015 and 2024, surpassing the BSE 200 TRI by 5.97%. IRR captures both realised and unrealised gains. The distribution to paid-in (DPI) capital ratio shows the realised gains for an investor. The benchmark belonging to the earliest vintage — fiscal 2014 — had a DPI ratio of 1.56, meaning investors received 56% more than their initial investment as of March 2024. Says Sandeep Sinha, Co-CEO, Oister, “This year’s Crisil-Oister report reinforces our long-held belief that private capital is not only participating in India’s growth story but also shaping it. In fiscal 2024, private markets once again demonstrated their ability to outperform and lead through long-term growth and sectoral innovation, setting a benchmark for resilience, scale and innovation.” Shanti Gold International Limited, a Mumbai-based manufacturer of 22kt CZ casting gold jewellery, based on installed production capacity (Source: CARE Report).

Title: Accounting rule changes have turned Bitcoin from risky venture to corporate must-have – Bitwise

According to Matt Hougan, the demand from this companies could impact the Bitcoin market in a positive and significant way. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitwise chief investment officer Matthew Hougan believes that companies adding Bitcoin (BTC) to their balance sheets are no longer an anomaly but a burgeoning megatrend that could transform the crypto market this year. In a recent memo to clients, Hougan highlighted that MicroStrategy has been making the headlines with its aggressive BTC accumulation strategy. The company has acquired approximately 257,000 BTC, more than all the Bitcoin mined last year, and plans to raise an additional $42 billion to continue its purchases. Hougan noted that the trend goes far beyond MicroStrategy. As of Jan. 14, 70 publicly traded companies, including household names like Tesla, Block, and Mercado Libre, hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. These companies hold 141,302 BTC combined, while private firms such as SpaceX and Block.one have disclosed at least 368 BTC in holdings. According to Hougan, the game-changer is the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) introduction of ASU 2023-08. This rule allows publicly traded companies to mark Bitcoin holdings to market value, enabling them to record profits when Bitcoin’s price rises. Previously, Bitcoin was treated as an “intangible asset,” forcing companies to write down its value if the price fell but not allowing them to recognize gains when it increased. With reputational risks declining and the accounting landscape more favorable, Hougan predicts an explosion in the number of companies buying Bitcoin. He estimates that the current count of 70 could grow to hundreds, even thousands, in the next 12 to 18 months. Additionally, Hougan argues that companies buy Bitcoin for the same reasons individuals do. Some see it as a hedge against dollar depreciation, others as a speculative asset to boost stock prices, and others as a signal of innovation to attract customers and talent. While motivations vary, he believes the influx of corporate demand has the potential to drive Bitcoin prices significantly higher, particularly as major players like Meta and others contemplate entry. Hougan concludes the document by saying that retail investors don’t need to understand why every company is buying Bitcoin. Instead, they should ask themselves where this demand is heading and what it means for the market.

Title: The Best Wireless Earbuds, Tested For Months By Our Tech Editor
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/article/the-best-wireless-earbuds/
Time Published: 2025-01-14T21:03:30Z

As the tech editor at Forbes Vetted, wireless earbuds need to tick a few boxes to earn my recommendation: They need to have great sound, stellar noise cancellation, a long battery life and intuitive controls. And since they always come with a carrying case, they should be portable and easy to locate if you happen to lose them around your home or office. The catch? After testing 19 pairs over several months, I found that there’s no one-size-fits-all best wireless earbud for everyone (more on that below). My personal top pick is the Bose QuietComfort Ultra wireless earbuds, which combine incredible audio quality and noise cancellation—by far the best of all the pairs I tested. But, they’re not going to be everyone’s favorite for a couple of reasons. abc The Bose are pricey, and in addition to the almost-$300 cost, you have to pay an extra $49 if you want a wireless charging case. Further, the battery drains after just a few hours. So if you’re not keen on spending hundreds on a pair of earbuds or you value battery life as a top priority, there are plenty of other worthy options. My top budget pick, the OnePlus Buds 3, can get you pretty great sound for less than $80. Others, like the premium Denon PerL Pros, use AI to enhance audio based on your ear shape. Based on rigorous testing with 19 sets over several months, here are my picks for the best wireless earbuds for 2025. Amazon Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Battery life: Up to 6 hours | Wireless charging case: No | Waterproof rating: IPX4 | Drivers: 8.4 mm | Noise-canceling: Yes Best for: Skip if: The noise canceling of the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds is unparalleled. During my testing, there were multiple times that I didn’t hear my husband approach until he tapped my shoulder. Subway rides also were also muted and I could enjoy reading my Kindle Paperwhite in near silence, quite a feat considering how screechy New York City public transit can be. The Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds feature an oval-shaped eartip for ergonomic comfort. While the equalizer adjustment controls aren’t too detailed (you can change the earbuds’ frequencies for bass, mids and trebles for up to six levels in either direction), they get the job done, and it’s not fully necessary to adjust them at all. I found myself only tweaking them a bit to enhance the bass, since the audio quality is so good out of the box. And if you find yourself swapping between your laptop and phone regularly, they support multipoint connectivity. All said, there are a couple drawbacks that left me less than enthused. For one, the battery life is relatively short; I wore them on a transcontinental flight and used them in the airport, thinking I would get a full six hours with ANC on—but I heard the dreaded low battery notification mid-flight. It’s not the end of the world—a quick 15-minute charge gets you another two hours in a pinch—but it’s a big enough drawback that if you want long-lasting earbuds, look elsewhere. Secondly, the case is a bulky beast that does not offer wireless charging, and you need to pay an additional $49 for a wireless charging case. I personally find this insulting, considering the already-costly $299 sticker price. Ultimately, I chose Bose’s QuietComfort Ultras as my top choice based solely on sound quality, and yes, it’s that good. Finally to clarify, the brand has wireless headphones with the same name, so keep this in mind when shopping to avoid confusion. Amazon Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Battery life: Up to 44 hours (including case) | Wireless charging case: No | Waterproof rating: IP55 | Drivers: 10.4 mm | Noise-canceling: Yes Best for: Skip if: The OnePlus Buds 3 feel like a dark horse winner as my best budget pick, but after extensive testing, they’re truly the best if you’re mindful of your spending. The earbuds come with touch controls, which is mostly fine, though during testing I learned the hard way not to apply a lot of pressure. If you do, the earbuds shift in your ear canal. They won’t fall out–they were quite secure in my ear–but it can be annoying. A simple tap or gentle long press is all you need to control them. If you’re not an iPhone or OnePlus phone user, then the app may also give you pause. The Hey Melody app for Android users doesn’t get as deep into the frequency weeds as other earbud apps, like the Denon PerL Pros. Still, it does a solid job of delivering the basics, including four listening profiles and the ability to create a custom profile via five different frequency settings. The OnePlus Buds 3 have a sleek design that fit snugly and comfortably in my ears. Looking past the app, though, the price/value ratio on these earbuds wowed me. The audio felt detailed and rich, especially once I turned on OnePlus 3D Audio (the brand’s version of spatial audio). I also completed a sound test profile to help finesse my listening experience, which enhanced some areas that I felt were lacking. They simply have no right to sound as good as they do, with some of the details in the mids layering nicely compared with other competitors in this price range. Could the audio be better? Absolutely—the bass in particular could be stronger. But at that point, you’re looking at spending three figures on the Bose or the Denons to get that high-quality deep bass. These earbuds cost around $70, and for the price, you get pretty darn good audio. Amazon Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Battery life: Up to 26 hours (including case) | Wireless charging case: Yes | Waterproof rating: IP57 | Drivers: Unknown | Noise-canceling: Yes The Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro wireless earbuds don’t offer the single best audio quality, and the ANC isn’t the absolute best on the market. But when I’m heading into the subway, or when I’m about to hop on a plane, they’re the pair I always take with me. I’ve had them since July’s Samsung Unpacked, and after testing them for several months with my Android device, they’re my top pick for the category because they represent the best combination of ANC, audio quality and more for Android users. Yes, they mimic the Apple AirPods’ design—that’s something the company caught flack for at the initial launch. But that design wears comfortably in my ears and I can keep them in for long hours without my ears feeling itchy, a problem I experience with most wireless earbuds. The Samsung Buds 3 Pros look similar in design to the Apple AirPods, but they're built for Android ... [+] users. Go to the app to adjust your ANC levels. There you’ll also find a few audio presets, including balanced, dynamic and bass boost. Personally, I found dynamic to be the most effective, but your mileage and preferences may vary. Other useful features include 360 audio which aims to place you in the middle of the action, and you can also turn on head-tracking if that suits you. Songs like Florence and the Machine’s “King” and “Cosmic Love” sounded rich and detailed. I typically test audio for the balance of the harp in the latter against the rest of the instrumentals. While further into the song, the harp was hard to distinguish, it’s still good enough for most needs. With many earbuds offering touch controls, the physical buttons feel like a boon in a sea of accidental touches, something that I’ve had happen more times thanks to my bushy hair. I’ve also felt the advertised battery life—around 7 hours—is good. Because they pair best with Samsung phones and I use the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, I can open the settings and see the battery life at a glance from the Bluetooth display. But that leads to another caveat: Android versus iOS. If you have an Android phone, particularly a Samsung device, these earbuds integrate just fine. If you have iOS, though, you may have a problem, as Apple users don’t have access some of the Wear app integrations—and to an extent, this affects Google Pixel users, too. But if you have an Android phone—and ideally a Samsung—these are the earbuds to get. Amazon Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Battery life: Up to 20 hours (including case) | Wireless charging case: Yes | Waterproof rating: IP54 | Drivers: Unknown | Noise-canceling: Yes Best for: Skip if: While the AirPods Pro 2 provide high fidelity audio and the new Hearing Aid features, if you don’t want all the extras, the Apple AirPods 4 With ANC (active noise cancellation) should be at the top of your list. They feature Apple’s signature sleek design, but what you don’t get is the silicone ear tips (which tend to deliver a more secure fit). If you’re not a jogger or if you’re not worried about an adjustable fit, this won’t matter much since I found they stayed firmly in my ears during my testing, despite my initial fear that they would fall out. One of my biggest surprises during testing was just how good the audio quality is despite the modest price tag. Could they sound better? Probably. But I pitted them against two earbuds—the Denon PerL Pros and the Bowers & Wilkins Pi8s—and I struggled to hear any audio quality differences among the three. That speaks pretty well about the audio fidelity that these affordable AirPods can output. It wasn’t until I tested this pair on Florence and The Machine’s “Cosmic Love” that I spotted some subtle differences in the mids and basses. Even then, if you’re not actively listening for audio details, you’re probably not going to notice. You won't find silicone ear tips on the Apple AirPods 4 With ANC. The ANC on them is also surprisingly good, but again, you’re not getting those silicone ear tips so don’t expect the best ANC that Apple has to offer. Apple’s ANC has a mode called Conversation Awareness that automatically adjusts so you can hear what’s going on around you when it detects that you’re talking to someone. It was great when I worked at home and wanted to tune out the schoolchildren in my neighborhood. But there were moments when I was listening to music and it registered my husband speaking with his parents in the same room and randomly subdued my audio when it registered that as a conversation. As for its battery life, it’s on par with Apple’s claim of four hours with ANC on, based on my testing. It’s not the best by far, but if you’re a casual listener, odds are you won’t be using them for more than four hours at a time, anyway. Amazon Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Battery life: Up to 40 hours (including case) | Wireless charging case: No | Waterproof rating: IPX4 | Drivers: 10mm | Noise-canceling: Yes Best for: Skip if: I’ve tested countless earbuds, but it’s not every day that I find a pair whose sound sets a new bar for audio quality. That’s exactly what happened when I tried the Denon PerL Pro wireless earbuds. Yes, they look like giant discs and feel a little unwieldy in my ears. But in my estimation, the audio quality is comparable products in the $300 price range. The Denon PerL Pros have a unique build. Interestingly, Denon refers to the earbuds’ ANC as the Immersion mode, and the earbuds “scan” your ears to customize the way it interacts with your ears. It sounds cool, and if you don’t want more control over your personalization, you can, but I don’t recommend it—the scan works just fine, and it’s designed for audiophiles that want to tinker with every single frequency. Once I’d completed the scan and switched to this mode, my audio was something of a mixed bag. Ashnikko’s songs sounded bass-heavy, while Florence and the Machine’s catalogue sounded incredible. I could hear every layer with clarity, even with the bass feeling overpowered during “Dog Days Are Over.” I also cross-tested with two other Florence songs, “King” and “Cosmic Love,” and found that for once I could clearly hear the bass on the former and every pluck of the harp on the latter. It was simply delightful. Remember when I mentioned they look unwieldy in my ears? They dwarf my ears when worn. However, there are some minor caveats to consider before splurging on these. They look like giant discs stuffed into your ears, and for those who thrive on subtlety and sleekness, that may be off-putting. The other issue is the “Immersion” ANC mode: You can’t control it. I’ve found in my travels that the ANC could be improved, as it’s not the strongest compared to the Bose QuietComfort Ultras or even the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro.

Battery life: 10 hours (without ANC); 40 hours with case | Wireless charging case: No | Waterproof rating: IPX4 | Drivers: Unknown | Noise-canceling: Yes Best for: Skip if: When the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds launched, I took them on two flights to test them for my full-length review. Even after returning home, I found myself skipping my SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro wireless headset in favor of these earbuds. SteelSeries nailed the comfort level right off the bat, offering three ear tips sizes to suit most needs, and the design fits snugly in my ear. Another key feature I appreciate is the physical button controls. It may sound surprising considering the industry shift to touch controls, but it’s a huge factor on why I keep coming back to these as my main gaming headset. With them, there are no accidental touches if you brush your hair behind your ear during gaming. SteelSeries products, including the Arctis GameBuds, offer a special EQ software called Sonar. Typically installed on a PC, in this case, it’s in the form of an app. This creates a caveat for gamers, though: no multipoint connectivity. Still, I appreciate that I can use either Bluetooth or 2.4GHz (with a dongle) to connect to my devices, including my beloved Nintendo Switch. The SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds feature physical buttons. The Arctis’ audio for music is quite good, but its real claim to fame is its gaming audio. You get spatial audio for gaming in a compact, portable package. It’s good enough that when battling in Far Cry 6, I can still hear movements clearly on one earbud versus the other. I can also hear the direction enemies move from—that’s very important as a gamer, and props to SteelSeries for factoring it into this compact package. As earbuds, this pick doesn’t quite rival the best gaming headsets if you want a truly immersive experience. Also, the battery life is underwhelming at 10 hours, as opposed to gaming headsets that can pack in 20 hours—and as much as 300 hours—of use before needing a recharge. But in the realm of wireless earbuds, 10 hours is impressive, especially since most of the picks on my list can only go up to six or eight hours before requiring a recharge. All in all, given their price and the audio quality, the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds are an incredible product that I find myself using almost daily. A quick note: If you plan on using these with your PlayStation, you’ll want the PlayStation model. It’s an important distinction to help get the most out of the gaming features available on these earbuds.

Battery life: Up to 7.5 hours | Wireless charging case: No | Waterproof rating: IPX4 | Drivers: 12mm (unconfirmed) | Noise-canceling: No Best for: Skip if: The Bose Ultra Open earbuds combine two features that are essential to runners: A comfortable, nonslip fit for hours of comfortable wear, and an open audio environment that lets you hear the world around you through your music. The earbuds clip onto your ear helix (you know, the outer, curved part of your ear) so you can wear them for hours in comfort. While I didn’t personally test this pair, they were (and continue to be) a top contender chosen by Forbes executive editor Dave Johnson, who has extensive experience testing, writing and editing in the tech world. “They are comfortable to wear for hours at a time, and they stay doggedly affixed to my ear no matter what I’m doing,” he says, adding that he uses them regularly in his workout routines. “Traditional earbuds, like the Apple AirPods Pro, tend to work themselves loose when I’m working out at the gym and I always need to fiddle with them to keep them from falling out while jogging on the treadmill. That’s no longer a problem with the Ultra Open.” That said, the audio is where the Opens begin to lose some of their appeal, and for audiophiles, you’ll want to decide whether it’s worth that ever-so-slight downgrade. During testing, the earbuds held up really well against the competition. “The sound is rich and full, with excellent spatial audio, and I can still feel the bass even though a lot of it is just radiated away into the air around my ears,” shares Johnson. But, it’s important to note that the bass doesn’t quite hit the same as compared with other earbuds, especially when compared to its sibling, the Bose QuietComfort Ultras. The battery life is also surprisingly stellar for a first-gen design, which wowed our testers. “I think Bose expects you to just leave these things clipped to your ears all day long, and the respectable battery life lets you do that,” says Johnson. He regularly enjoys more than 7 hours of continuous runtime with spatial audio off (it dropped to around 4.5 hours with spatial audio on). And, if you’re running low on battery, the accompanying case gets him an additional two full charges, too.

Battery life: Up to 8 hours | Wireless charging case: No | Waterproof rating: IPX4 | Drivers: 12mm | Noise-canceling: No Best for: Skip if: This year at CES—an annual, world-renown tech exhibition—an Anker PR rep handed me this pair of Soundcore AeroClips, telling me they had just launched and to take them for a spin. An offshoot to Anker, Soundcore is a budget-friendly line that promises to deliver big sound for less. I tossed them on my ears and essentially wore them nonstop for a few days, wearing out the eight-hour battery life to get a sense of how they performed. The Soundcore AeroClips are comfortable to wear for long hours without feeling bogged down by their ... [+] bulk. I was tickled pink by how delightful I found these open ear wireless earbuds. They’re comfortable to wear for long hours without feeling bogged down by their bulk, which was surprising; unlike the Bose Ultra Opens, which are my “best open ear” pick, the AeroClips “clip” onto your ear helix (although, I also felt they rested on my ears a bit). I did note that sometimes I needed to adjust them with my glasses on, but that wasn’t the end of the world. Bose still takes the cake in comfort, but I didn’t mind wearing these for many hours. I was also very pleasantly surprised with the audio on these, but there’s a caveat: Soundcore offers a Soundcore Signature preset that I find abysmal at best. As a classically trained musician, I believe music should be balanced and clear so you feel like you’re smack dab in the action; too much bass, and it gets muddy, whereas an emphasis on treble frequencies can leave your audio sounding tinny. The Signature preset across a few Soundcore models varies greatly, and on the AeroClips, there was virtually no balance whatsoever. But, not all is lost here. I found the cinematic sound I sought with the Classical preset, which is the one I would recommend using. if you’re looking for big sound on a small budget, this pair is hard to beat. Ultimately, open ear wireless earbuds at this price shouldn’t sound this good, but Soundcore pulled it off—and kudos to them, because I’m impressed. Soundcore put a lot of thought and consideration into the AeroClips, and it shows in these earbuds. You’ll have to wait a bit to get them as they begin shipping January 22, but if you’re looking for big sound on a small budget—specifically if you want buds to use while running in the park , letting you listen to audio while also hearing outside noises—this pair is hard to beat. While my top picks represent some of the best wireless earbuds you can buy right now, many others didn’t quite make the cut. Below are 11 more models I tested, plus reasons why they didn’t earn a spot on this list. Anker Soundcore C40i ($90 at Amazon): I wanted to love the Soundcore C40i wireless earbuds, and if budget is your priority for open ear wireless earbuds, these are the pick for you. But I found the audio quality to be lacking. It’s good enough for runs and general gym activities, but if you spend an extra $30 for the AeroClips (which made it on this list), your ears will thank you. OnePlus Buds 3 Pro ($99 at Amazon): The OnePlus Buds 3 Pros are pretty darn good, but they don’t fit into any specific category. Like my top budget pick, the OnePlus Buds 3, they use the Melody app if you’re not a OnePlus or iPhone user, but it’s still a worthwhile pick. That said, if you’re a OnePlus user, it’s worth the upgrade to the Buds 3 Pro over the Buds 3. Audio-Technica ATH-CKS50TW2 ($149 at Amazon): The ATH-CKS50TW2 earbuds excel at one thing: battery life. They can last up to 15 hours with ANC on, 25 without, and you get an extra 40 hours with the charging case. The audio, however, felt a little too muddy for my taste despite fiddling with the EQ. It’s still pretty darn good though, and most users will be happy with this pair. It’s also hard to argue with another huge boon to their build: physical buttons, which are quickly becoming a relic in earbud designs—I personally love this choice. Bowers & Wilkins Pi8 ($320 at Amazon): I wanted to love these earbuds—they were on par with the Denon PerL Pros during my testing. However, both managing editor Emmy Favilla and I both had connectivity issues with two separate review units during our testing. For the price—the highest of any I tested at $399—that’s unacceptable. If you can stomach that, you may have to put them back in the case once or twice before they work in your ears, then they’re a good choice. Sony LinkBuds ($178 at Amazon): These were also a near miss. They feature a new, innovative design with ear tips shaped like a comma. However, I found them uncomfortable in my ears even after adjusting and swapping ear tips multiple times. Despite deep testing the audio features, I found the audio quality lacking, and I had concerns over the case’s longevity; it felt cheaply built. Simply put, while they’d be great for teens, as an audiophile, I wasn’t a fan. JLab GoPop ANC ($30 at Walmart): I loved these earbuds. They’re comfortable to wear for long periods, and the charging case is tiny and features a built-in charging cable. My problem? At the loudest, they’re not very loud in my ears, and many of the songs I listened to lacked bass even with the bass boost turn on. Still, for the price, these would be a great choice for teens who want decent audio without a sky-high price tag. JLab JBuds Mini ($40 at Amazon): For their tiny size, I’ve been pleasantly surprised by the power behind the JLab JBuds Mini Wireless Earbuds. That said, I found that I needed the largest size for one of my ears, otherwise the earbud felt too loose; your mileage may vary, and they may not fit if you have larger ears. They also don’t come with ANC—only passive noise cancellation. I still had to turn the earbuds down to hear my husband during walks in the local park, so while not the strongest, it does reduce some sound. One thing to note: During testing, I noted that on windy days, the Bluetooth connectivity frequently cut out, which is why they didn’t make my best budget pick. Baseus M2 (out of stock): The Baseus M2s are really comfortable in the ears and for the price, the ANC is surprisingly very effective. I found myself tossing these in my ears fairly often at my desk to tune out the school next door to my house over others due to how effective it was. However, the audio for music doesn’t quite match up to its competitors. It’s great for podcasts and audiobooks, though, and its price is very attractive. Google Pixel Buds 2 Pro ($199 at Amazon): During testing, Favilla noted the Google Pixel Buds 2 Pro felt comfortable to wear over long periods of time, and taking calls felt seamless. The sound quality is on par with the previous generation, and they paired almost instantly with a Google Pixel 7 Pro. Google did a stellar job upgrading its ANC from the previous generation, too. Marshall Motif II ANC ($150 at Amazon): The Motif II ANC earbuds sound pretty great, and packs punchy basses and high trebles for an enjoyable listening experience. But upon further testing, the noise canceling and construction could be improved. Jabra Elite 10 Gen 2 ($200 at Best Buy): The Jabra Elite 10 Gen 2 earbuds have some of the best ANC in the business, with a solid audio profile, to boot. They’re so good they nearly eliminate airplane engines in flight. Unfortunately, Jabra announced this generation is the last in its consumer line it will produce. More concerning, Jabra only guaranteed updates for two years. With most earbuds lasting much longer than that, I can’t fully recommend a short-lived product. To find the best wireless earbuds on the market, I put over a dozen pairs to the test, narrowing down options to top-rated brands like Bose, Sony and more. From there, I put my shortlist to the test. The best wireless earbuds should feel sturdily built, with a sleek design that feels comfortable in your ears. After all, if you’re wearing them for an extended period of time, you shouldn't feel any discomfort. I also evaluated the design based on wireless charging versus wired only, case bulk and more. No matter what genre you’re listening to, your audio quality should have a reasonable balance of base, mids and treble frequencies. None of these frequencies should sound muddled or distorted during listening sessions, and so I looked for crystal clear clarity and smoothness amongst the frequencies. I cross-checked audio quality in each pair of wireless earbuds across a variety of songs, and I considered whether ANC and spatial audio changed the overall sound quality. Some of the genres that I listen to include alternative, rock, classical, audiobooks/podcasts and more. Specifically, some of the songs I tested each pair of wireless earbuds include: When you’re listening to your music, you want to be able to listen for hours without interruptions. I tested these earbuds for 30 minutes each, logging battery light percentage at the beginning and at the end. I also cross tested this with the ANC on versus off to get a sense of whether each pair lived up to its claims. I’ve been involved in tech journalism for over five years, including more than a year as the consumer tech and electronics editor at Forbes Vetted. In addition to working with home entertainment, such as testing the best gaming TVs and the best TVs for bright rooms, I have also tested most of the latest smart wearables currently on the market, from the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses to the SteelSeries Arctis Nova GameBuds and more. In my time testing wireless earbuds, I focus on aspects of interest to everyone, from casual folks who want a no-frills set of earbuds for occasional listening to serious audiophiles who want to enjoy every single guitar strum. For this story, I focused on various features each pair of wireless earbuds offered as they applied to work, travel and more everyday scenarios. I evaluated a slew of features on each pair, including audio quality, software integrations, ANC and more. I also made sure to test each earbuds for a minimum of 10 hours to dive into the finer details each pair offered. I also carefully reviewed the software for each pair of wireless earbuds offered to determine which had the best balance of features and price. When I’m not testing the latest audio equipment, I’ve spent plenty of time testing the newest mobile devices. I’ve deep-dived into the Apple ecosystem with the iPhone 16 Pro and reviewed plenty of Android devices, including the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and the Google Pixel 8. Most recently, I tested the Google Pixel 9 Pro. I added two new recommendations: the Anker Soundcore AeroClip earbuds as the best budget open ear pick and the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds as the best gaming earbuds. I also added notes on three other contenders that didn’t quite make the cut.

Title: Meta Cuts 5% of Workforce to ‘Move Out Low-Performers,’ Zuckerberg Says

The parent company of Facebook and Instagram is cutting 3,620 jobs Another day, another round of big changes at Meta: The parent company of Facebook and Instagram is cutting roughly 5% of its workforce — or 3,620 employees — as it looks to “move out low-performers faster,” according to a memo from CEO Mark Zuckerberg that was obtained by Bloomberg on Tuesday. Zuckerberg said the cuts are coming after he “decided to raise the bar” on performance” at his company. “This is going to be an intense year, and I want to make sure we have the best people on our teams,” Zuckerberg said. The 40-year-old Meta founder said employees who are laid off will be notified starting on February 10. Meta’s headcount at the end of September, the most recent period data is available for, was 72,404. Zuckerberg’s memo on the job cuts adds to a busy start to 2025 for the company. Notably, Meta ended its third-party fact checking operation last week, with Zuckerberg saying the move was about “restoring free expression” on Facebook and Instagram, where he said the fact checkers had made “too many mistakes” in recent years. Meta will be rolling out a new feature similar to X’s Community Notes, Zuckerberg said. On Friday, Zuckerberg compared the fact checking operation to George Orwell’s dystopian novel, “1984,” while appearing on the Joe Rogan podcast. He added the Biden Administration “basically pushed” the company to censor certain topics, including what the government felt was COVID-19 misinformation. And in other Meta news, the company announced it was ending its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs on Friday. Meta’s stock price is up 1.1% on the year to $596.27 per share.

Title: TD Synnex Corp. (NYSE:SNX): Buzzing on Hyve

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on TD Synnex Corp. (NYSE:SNX) on ValueInvestorsClub by RugPull1995. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on SNX. The company’s shares were trading at $115.50 when this thesis was published, vs. the closing price of $132.84 on Jan 13. A technical analyst using a cloud-based analytics dashboard for financial services. SNX operates as a distributor and solutions aggregator for the information technology (IT) ecosystem. The company offers personal computing devices and peripherals, mobile phones and accessories, printers, supplies, and endpoint technology software; and data center technologies, such as hybrid cloud, security, storage, networking, servers, technology software, and converged and hyper-converged infrastructure. It also provides systems design and rack integration, build-to-order, and configure-to-order assembly. SNX is the leading IT distributor in North America and Europe, with a global market share of 16%. While growth in this segment has stalled, Hyve, a business that manufactures servers, storage and networking equipment for hyperscalers, has tremendous potential. 40% of Hyve’s business comes from Meta and there is potential to strike a deal with Oracle in the next year. The cloud capex for Meta and Oracle are projected to be 13% and 32% from 2024 to 2027 and will have a direct bearing on Hyve’s business. With increasing geopolitical tensions in Taiwan, it provides more business opportunities as mega players like Meta, Microsoft and Amazon look to build onshore capabilities. This segment offers a higher margin and a better growth prospect compared to the distribution segment. The core business is also expected to witness an up-cycle from 2025. The demand for PCs during Covid surged due to work-from-home requirements. The average life of these PCs is 5 years, making 2025 the terminal year that would prompt users to buy new PCs. The fundamental logic can be applied to servers, network equipment and storage as well but with a slightly wider timeline i.e. 2020-2022. The stock trades at 10x its 2024 EPS and 8x based on its 2025 EPS estimates. Separately valuing Hyve at 10.5x its EBIT multiple and 9x for SNX’s other business yields a fair value of $157, implying a potential 19% upside with low risk. While we acknowledge the potential of SNX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SNX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Update: 1/15/2025, 9:55 a.m. ET: We’ve received a statement from The Pokémon Company International regarding this situation, which is reproduced in full below. In it, the company states that it is attempting to print more cards for the sniped sets, as well as promising restocks on the Pokémon Center websites in the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The original story follows below, with the statement added at the bottom. The Pokémon trading card game (PTCG) is in a really big mess. And once again, it’s because it has become too popular for its own good. If you were hoping to pick up some product from the forthcoming Prismatic Evolutions special sets, well, good luck to you. And March’s just-announced Journey Together set? Pre-orders sold out in literal seconds. Whether it’s because of scalpers, a sudden new tidal wave of interest via Pokémon TCG Pocket, or evil space spiders, The Pokémon Company International desperately needs to react, and fast. I first noticed something was wrong the day that Prismatic Evolutions went up for pre-order on the Pokémon Center website. The official Pokémon online store, both in the UK and the U.S., was acting strangely: the new special set (so-called because it will be released in boxed and tinned products throughout 2025, but not be sold as individual booster packs) was marked as “UNAVAILABLE” the moment it was put in the store. After a while, “UNAVAILABLE” switched to “SOLD OUT,” and that was that. Somehow, despite never being possible to buy, it was gone. The very same thing happened at the end of last week with the announcement of March’s next full set, Journey Together. At this point, it has become very apparent something is going horribly wrong. For reasons too dull to get into, about a year-and-a-half ago, I got into the habit of refreshing the Pokémon Center websites for the UK and the U.S. a pretty troubling number of times a day. This reflex stuck and has proven useful in the long time since, helping me get the scoop on new products, and indeed ensuring I could buy myself the special Pokémon Center version of each set’s Elite Trainer Box (ETB), which invariably sold very quickly. So it is that I tend to notice new product on the site long before press releases go out, and being in the UK, often get the jump on what will be added to the North American site later the same day. And so it was that I discovered Prismatic Evolutions was on sale far before any official announcements, and indeed that it was not possible to buy. I contacted TPCi at the time—November 6—via their UK PR department (TPCi is notoriously difficult to get in touch with), with an incredibly innocuous question about how the products appeared to be sold out before ever actually being available. Was it a glitch? Was it unprecedented demand? Either way, you’d imagine the company would like to make it clear to customers. But instead, I received a response that read, “Pokémon does not have any additional information to share on the below.” Perplexed, I left it, because—as I say—I’m aware how hard it is to get any information from TPCi, and even a “no comment” was a rare treat. Then, come January 9, the same thing happened again. Journey Together had yet to be officially acknowledged as a set by TPCi, but there it was on the Pokémon Center. Four products—the 36-pack booster box, the ETB, a six-pack booster bundle, and individual packs—all listed as available to buy on the “New Releases” page of the store, but all marked as “UNAVAILABLE” when you clicked through. Weirder, I noticed this time, was that it didn’t say it was unavailable immediately, but rather after the tiniest fraction of a second. For that split-second before, the usual, yellow “ADD TO BASKET” button would flicker. I tried a bunch of times to see if I could click on it before it changed, eventually succeeded, but received only a strange error message. And then, after about an hour, the New Releases page updated the products to be “SOLD OUT,” and even more tellingly, a front page giant banner for the new product that was latterly added to the site was entirely removed. So, obviously, I got in touch with Pokémon’s UK PR to ask what was happening, but despite repeated attempts over the last five days, haven’t heard anything back. So what’s going on? Well, without a response from TPCi, it’s hard to be certain. But it makes sense to assume it’s directly the fault of bots and scalpers, looking to resell unopened products at vastly inflated prices. Right now, a $60 ETB of Prismatic Evolutions has a resale market price of $400, while others are selling their pre-orders of Journey Together ETBs on eBay for $150+. To be clear, these are the sorts of items that would usually be stood in huge piles in your local card store, and easily available in Target and Walmart. What’s brought this about is likely more complicated. Prismatic Evolutions is one of those sets, like 2023's 151, that will bring lots of people to the hobby. It’s an Eevee-based set, and it’s had a lot of buzz. That’s one factor. Then there’s Pokémon TCG Pocket, which has been a phenomenon, drawing in tens of millions of players, inevitably a gateway for vast numbers to want to collect the physical cards too. And, of course, there’s momentum. Once prices start going up, more people try to take advantage of those increases, buying up stock to increase scarcity, driving prices up further, and so on. We’re definitely in that vicious loop right now. You might say we’ve been here before, first in 2016 when Pokémon GO caused a vast amount of new interest in the TCG, and then to the most outlandish degree in 2020 and 2021, when Logan Paul sparked a wild surge in prices after paying $150,000 for a Base Set Charizard, leading to a lockdown-driven crazy spike in interest in classic cards. However, what marks this situation as different is the cards it involves. Both previous spikes were about classic cards, seeing the prices of old collections increasing exponentially, and in many cases, still maintaining that value today. But in both situations, while newer sets certainly proved a lot more popular, they were still widely available. The only exception to this would be Japan’s Clay Burst set that in 2023 astonishingly caused Japan to sell out of all Pokémon cards, but the Iono card responsible didn’t cause anything similar in the rest of the world when it was later released in English. The reason it’s so different this time is that it’s affecting the brand-new sets, and that’s an issue for two important reasons. Firstly, it breaks the entire hobby for regular people. If you’re someone (like me) who tries to pick up an ETB and then buys a bunch of loose packs here and there, you’re now just shit out of luck. Casual collectors can’t try to get a few nice cards for their binders. Kids looking to spend their allowance on a $5 pack will go home disappointed. That really sucks, and it’s going to badly affect the reputation of the game. And secondly, the game. These cards, while often bought in the gambling-lite hope of pulling a rare card, actually exist to be the playing cards for a massively popular game. And if you can’t buy the new sets at sensible prices, you can’t keep up with the meta, can’t redesign your decks, and just can’t join in anymore. There are millions of people, kids and adults, who meet up every week for clubs, who will be negatively affected by this sudden inability to buy anything new. (Browsing my usual online store right now, there’s not a single item from the last three full sets I can buy right now.) As I was preparing this article, I noticed that the astonishingly popular Pokémon YouTuber, “PokeRev,” uploaded a video last night, commenting on very similar problems. With almost 3 million followers, the streamer who most know as “Rev,” real name Nick, has a lot of reach. He sources his cards as a retailer, rather than a customer, invariably receiving crates of stock of each product, which is opened daily on his channel, and almost always given away to viewers. As such, he tends to get new sets before they’re available to buy, and presumably to the frustration of TPCi, opens hundreds of packs long before their shelf date. (Pokémon PR in the U.S. very generously sends me advance sample packs of each new set, so I can write about them on Kotaku, and Nick almost always gets his product before even these arrive.) But in his most recent video, PokeRev is unusually candid, almost emotional, as he discusses the lack of availability of recent sets. Stating it began with November’s set, Surging Sparks, he explains how the resale prices of brand new cards have gone through the roof, as availability in stores has become minimal. And that things have become so extreme at this point, that as he tore into Prismatic Evolutions in the last few days, he’s been feeling a sense of guilt, that he knows his viewers aren’t going to be able to buy it for themselves. (Rev plans to give all his bulk to local card stores, on top of giving product away to viewers.) I’m certain PokeRev’s speaking out is likely to cause more consternation within TPCi than my coverage, and I imagine others will jump on board too, so hopefully we might finally see the company pushed into addressing this issue. Because, for them, selling out is selling out, whether it’s bots or kids buying the cards. The only way to make them care is reputationally. (And please, please don’t pay the scalp prices—that motivates the situation and ensures it can’t improve.) In the meantime, if you were hoping to enjoy a pack from the newer sets, or to update your deck for competitive play, then...damn. You might want to make a loud stink about it, in the hope that something will get done. Update: 01/15/2024, 9:55 a.m. ET: We’ve received a detailed reply from TPCi about this situation and the company’s attempts to address the issues with new reprints and restocks of its online stores. There is, however, no information regarding how it might attempt to prevent a repeat of the current situation, with bots and scalpers scooping everything first, nor indeed any mention of the other affected set, March’s Journey Together. Here’s the statement in full: We’re aware that some fans may experience difficulties purchasing certain Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet—Prismatic Evolutions products at launch due to high demand impacting availability. We understand this inconvenience can be disappointing for fans, and we are actively working to print more of the impacted Pokémon TCG products as quickly as possible and at maximum capacity to acknowledge this. Reprinted products are expected to be available at participating retailers as soon as possible to help ensure more fans receive opportunities to access Scarlet & Violet—Prismatic Evolutions. In addition, more new products from the Scarlet & Violet—Prismatic Evolutions lineup will be launching in the coming months. Pokémon Center preorders for Scarlet & Violet—Prismatic Evolutions products that were placed during the preorder timeframe will begin shipping in mid-January. Scarlet & Violet—Prismatic Evolutions products will be restocked at Pokémon Center in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Australia, and New Zealand later this year. Fans can subscribe to the Pokémon Center newsletter to receive updates. We’d like to thank the community for their continued support and patience as we work to deliver this highly anticipated expansion to fans. .

Welcome back to the newsletter. We are changing things up, so expect to see at least two editions each week, with the occasional special edition. The newsletter will continue to live on Engadget.com too, but if you haven’t subscribed, you should do that. Next week, Samsung will reveal its next family of Galaxy phones. Not the foldables, no, but the traditional S series devices. Going on track record, we can expect to see three S25 devices: standard, Plus and Ultra. There’s unlikely to be a huge change to aesthetics, but we expect some subtle differences — rounded corners, flatter edges and (of course) thinner bezels. Inside, at least in the US, the S25 series will probably be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite, designed for on-device generative AI. The chip promises 45 percent faster single- and multi-core performance while using 27 percent less power than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, so it could improve battery life too. Some rumors suggest a Galaxy S25 Slim with a — you guessed it — slimmer design. It’s all very on trend. However, given the FCC certifications only appear to cover the usual trio of flagships, that device may not arrive until later in the year. (If at all.) Expect an awful lot of AI razzle-dazzle too. One rumor suggests the Galaxy S25 series will include “an AI Agent that provides personalized clothing suggestions and transport information,” even though Google and myriad third-party apps already fully service the latter. I’d put money on a laborious bragging segment from Samsung and its AI tricks — many of which will fall by the wayside. A request: Please steal the Pixel’s Add Me photo feature.

Back in May 2024, the company rolled out a mobile app rife with bugs and missing features like alarms and sleep timers. Some customers even complained that entire speaker systems would no longer work after updating to the new app. Sonos’ stock price has fallen by around 13 percent since the app launched. Sonos laid off over 100 people in August as it tried to fix the software and revenue fell 16 percent in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended on September 28. Spence’s payout package includes $7,500 per month until June, a cash severance of $1.9 million and shares in Sonos. I aspire to screw up an app update. Continue reading. Meta appeared to block links to Pixelfed, a decentralized photo-sharing platform, on Facebook, according to users on both Bluesky and 404 Media. A small group of posts that linked to pixelfed.social was deleted, with Facebook’s Community Standards on spam used as a justification. There’s a bigger impetus for users to jettison Instagram: Meta just announced dramatic changes to how it plans to moderate speech on its platforms. The company is ending both its third-party fact-checking program and made changes to its Hateful Conduct policy last week. A Meta spokesperson said removing the posts to Pixelfed was a mistake, and they’d be reinstated. Continue reading.

Title: YieldMax™ Launches Its First Portfolio ETF The Crypto Industry & Tech Portfolio Option Income ETF (LFGY)
URL: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/01/14/3009146/0/en/YieldMax-Launches-Its-First-Portfolio-ETF-The-Crypto-Industry-Tech-Portfolio-Option-Income-ETF-LFGY.html

Full Content:
January 14, 2025 06:55 ET | Source: YieldMax YieldMax CHICAGO, MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, Jan. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax™ announced the launch today of its first YieldMax™ Portfolio Option Income ETF: YieldMax™ Crypto Industry & Tech Portfolio Option Income ETF (NYSE Arca: LFGY) LFGY Overview LFGY is an actively managed ETF that seeks current income and capital appreciation via direct investments in a select portfolio of 15-30 crypto industry and technology (“Crypto”) companies. LFGY aims to generate current income through an options portfolio on Crypto companies and/or Crypto ETFs. LFGY Equity Portfolio LFGY seeks capital appreciation via direct investments in its portfolio of 15-30 Crypto companies. To enable LFGY to effectively implement its options strategies (see below), LFGY’s Adviser evaluates the liquidity of a potential company’s common stock and the liquidity of its options contracts. Any dividend paid by its Crypto companies will contribute to LFGY’s income generation. LFGY Options Portfolio LFGY seeks to generate current income primarily by writing (selling) options contracts on some or all of its Crypto companies. Depending on the Adviser’s outlook, it will select one or more options strategies that it believes will best provide LFGY with current income while generally also attempting to participate in a portion of the share price increases experienced by its Crypto companies. Further, depending on the Adviser’s assessment of one or more of the Crypto companies’ options contracts (e.g., they are insufficiently liquid or too costly), LFGY may employ options strategies on a Crypto ETF. By strategically entering and exiting options positions, the Adviser seeks to enhance LFGY's income potential. LFGY Distribution Schedule LFGY is the newest member of the YieldMax™ ETF family and like all YieldMax™ ETFs, LFGY aims to deliver current income to investors. With respect to distributions, LFGY aims to make distributions on a weekly basis and its first weekly distribution is expected to be announced on January 22, 2025. Why Invest in LFGY? Please see table below for distribution information for all outstanding YieldMax™ ETFs. Note: DIPS, FIAT, CRSH and YQQQ are hereinafter referred to as the “Short ETFs” and “ADR” stands for American Depositary Receipt. You are not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from period to period and may be zero. Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s). * The inception date for FEAT and FIVY is December 16, 2024. 1 Each ETF’s strategy (except those of the Short ETFs) will cap potential gains if its reference asset’s shares increase in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset’s shares decrease in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. Each Short ETF’s strategy will cap potential gains if its reference asset decreases in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset increases in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. 2 The Distribution per Share is the most recent such amount as of close on January 13, 2025. Each Fund has a limited operating history and while each Fund’s objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Important Information Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about each Fund, visit our website at www.YieldMaxETFs.com. Read the prospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any Fund’s investment strategy will be properly implemented, and an investor may lose some or all of its investment in any such Fund. Tidal Financial Group is the adviser for all YieldMax™ ETFs. THE FUND, TRUST AND ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERENCE ASSET. Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs) YMAX, YMAG, FEAT and FIVY generally invest in other YieldMax™ ETFs. As such, these two Funds are subject to the risks listed in this section, which apply to all the YieldMax™ ETFs they may hold from time to time. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may increase the Fund’s expenses. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTR, MARA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to MARO) Digital Assets Risk: The Fund does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than the Fund. Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: The securities underlying BABO and TSMY are American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”). Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared ("cleared derivatives"). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house ("clearing members") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

Title: Stock market today: Asian markets are mixed, echoing trading on Wall Street

Yuri Kageyama Associated Press Published: January 13, 2025 at 10:45 PM Updated: January 14, 2025 at 5:43 PM Yuri Kageyama Associated Press TOKYO – Most U.S. stocks rose Tuesday following an encouraging update on inflation, though drops for Eli Lilly and other influential stocks kept indexes in check. The S&P 500 rose 0.1% as three out of every four stocks in the index climbed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 221 points, or 0.5%, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.2%. Recommended Videos Stocks got a boost from a report showing inflation at the U.S. wholesale level wasn’t as high last month as economists expected. It’s an encouraging signal ahead of a report coming Wednesday, which will show how much inflation U.S. consumers faced at gasoline pumps, grocery registers and auto lots in December. Stubbornly high readings on inflation and a run of better-than-expected updates on the U.S. economy have sent Wall Street into a weekslong rut, pulling it further from the dozens of all-time highs set last year. The fear is that all the strong data will convince the Federal Reserve to deliver less relief this year through lower interest rates. The Fed has already hinted it’s likely to cut rates just two times in 2025, down from an earlier projection of four. Speculation is growing about whether the Fed may cut rates zero times this year. Such questions have sent Treasury yields sharply higher in the bond market, which cranks up the pressure on the stock market. Yields slowed their ascent following the update on wholesale inflation. The yield on the 10-year Treasury held at 4.78%, where it was late Monday. It was below 3.65% in September. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, eased to 4.36% from 4.39%. On Wall Street, KB Home rose 4.8% after delivering a better profit for its latest quarter than analysts expected. The rise in Treasury yields has made mortgages more expensive, but CEO Jeffrey Mezger said buyers nevertheless “continued to demonstrate a desire for homeownership and housing market conditions improved relative to last year.” Mezger said faster build times helped the company deliver more homes in the three months through November. H&E Equipment Services more than doubled to top $90 after United Rentals said it will buy its smaller rival for $92 per share in cash. The deal values H&E, which rents aerial work platforms, earthmoving equipment and other products, at $4.8 billion, including roughly $1.4 billion of net debt. United Rentals rose 5.9%. Indexes drifted between gains and losses through the day in large part due to drops for several Big Tech stocks. Nvidia fell 1.1% and was the second-heaviest weight on the S&P 500. The only stock to drag more on the market was Eli Lilly, which fell 6.6% after saying it expects to report weaker revenue for the last three months of 2024 than previously forecast. CEO David Ricks said last quarter’s 45% growth in Lilly’s revenue for its Mounjaro diabetes treatment, Zepbound obesity injections and other products in the incretin market wasn’t as big as expected. Also on the losing end of the market was Signet Jewelers, which tumbled 21.7%. The diamond seller said its sales in the peak shopping days leading up to Christmas this past holiday season were below its forecasts. Shoppers were focusing on lower-priced fashion gifts “even more than anticipated in a continued competitive environment,” said Joan Hilson, chief financial and operating officer. Several of the nation’s biggest financial companies will report their latest results on Wednesday, including JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, as earnings reporting season gears up. Such reports are always under the spotlight, but companies may be under more pressure to impress this time around. If Treasury yields continue to rise, either stock prices need to fall or companies need to produce bigger profit growth to make up for it. All told Tuesday, the S&P 500 rose 6.69 points to 5,842.91. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 221.16 to 42,518.28, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 43.71 to 19,044.39. In stock markets abroad, indexes were higher across much of Europe and Asia with a few exceptions. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index fell 1.8% following a holiday on Monday, but indexes were much stronger in China where stocks rose 1.8% in Hong Kong and 2.5% in Shanghai. Crude oil prices fell to give back some of their strong gains in recent weeks, which had also been cranking up the pressure on inflation. Benchmark U.S. crude eased 1.7% to $77.50 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 1.3% to $79.92 per barrel. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Title: Asian shares trade mixed after drops for Big Tech leave Wall Street mixed

JapanToday Sotokanda S Bldg. 4F 5-2-1 Sotokanda Chiyoda-ku Tokyo 101-0021 Japan Tel: +81 3 5829 5900 Fax: +81 3 5829 5919 Email: editor@japantoday.com ©2025 GPlusMedia Inc. Asian shares were mixed Tuesday, echoing trading on Wall Street, where gains for oil and gas producers helped offset drops for Nvidia and other Big Tech companies. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index slipped 2.0% in afternoon trading to 38,394.09 following a holiday on Monday. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.5% to 8,231.00. South Korea's Kospi edged up 0.3% to 2,497.95. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 1.9% to 19,234.98, while the Shanghai Composite surged 2.1% to 3,227.11. “After a holiday break, Japan’s markets are playing catch-up following last week’s market selloff,” said Yeap Jun Rong, market strategist at IG. Japan’s Finance Ministry reported that the surplus in the current account, a measure of the country's foreign exchanges in goods, services and investments, rose to 3.4 trillion yen ($21 billion) in November, up 54.5% from the same month the previous year. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 rose 0.2% after erasing an earlier fall of 0.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 358 points, or 0.9%, while the weakness for Big Tech stocks dragged the Nasdaq composite to a loss of 0.4%. Stocks have been under pressure the last month, and the S&P 500 is coming off its fourth losing week in the last five as traders reduce expectations for how much relief the Federal Reserve may deliver this year through lower interest rates. Such cuts would give the economy a boost, and the U.S. stock market ran to repeated records last year on the assumption that more are coming after the Fed began lowering rates in September. But inflation has remained above the Fed’s 2% target, and recent reports have suggested a still-solid U.S. economy doesn’t need much help. Questions are growing about whether the Fed will deliver even a single cut in 2025. High rates put downward pressure on prices for all kinds of investments, and those seen as expensive can feel the stiffest punches. Nvidia fell 2% and was the heaviest weight on the S&P 500, though that represents just a smidgen of the index's huge gains in recent years. The chip company’s stock had nearly quintupled over the last three years amid the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. Apple’s 1% slip and Meta Platforms’ fall of 1.2% were also among the heaviest weights on the market. Because they’re two of the largest companies on Wall Street, their moves pack more punch on the S&P 500 than other stocks. Moderna tumbled 16.8% for the largest loss in the S&P 500 after giving a forecast for revenue this coming year that fell short of analysts’ expectations. The vaccine maker, which is seeing a slowdown in COVID-related sales, is accelerating a cost-cutting program. Macy’s fell 8.1% after saying it will likely report revenue for the last three months of 2024 that’s at or slightly below the low end of the forecast range it had earlier given. Edison International fell another 11.9% as wildfires continue to burn in the territory of its Southern California Edison utility. The utility has said fire agencies are investigating whether its equipment was involved in the ignition of the Hurst fire. On the winning side of Wall Street were oil-and-gas companies after the price of oil climbed. On Monday, a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude rose 2.9% to $78.82, while Brent crude climbed 1.6% to $81.01. The Biden administration said Friday it’s expanding sanctions against Russia’s energy industry. Exxon Mobil gained 2.6%, and Valero Energy jumped 4.9%. By Tuesday afternoon in Asia, benchmark U.S. crude lost 38 cents to $78.44 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 47 cents to $80.54 a barrel. Shares of U.S. Steel rallied 6.1% after the Biden administration pushed back to June the deadline it imposed for the Pittsburgh-based company to unwind its proposed acquisition by Japan’s Nippon Steel. Intra-Cellular Therapies soared 34.1% after Johnson & Johnson said it would buy the biopharmaceutical company and its treatment for bipolar I and II depression for $132 per share in cash. Johnson & Johnson rose 1.7%. All told, the S&P 500 added 9.18 points to 5,836.22. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 358.67 to 42,297.12, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 73.53 to 19,088.10. In the bond market, which has been dictating much of Wall Street’s action lately, Treasury yields ticked higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.78% from 4.76% late Friday. It’s been climbing relentlessly over the last month, and it was below 3.65% just in September. If Treasury yields continue to rise, either stock prices need to fall or companies need to produce bigger profit growth to make up for it. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar edged up to 157.58 Japanese yen from 157.26 yen. The euro cost $1.0252, down from $1.0274. ZenMarket helps you buy and ship goods from Japan.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks gained ground in afternoon trading on Wall Street Tuesday following an encouraging update on inflation. The S&P 500 was up 0.3% in afternoon trading, after wobbling between gains and losses earlier in the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 201 points, or 0.5%, as of 2:14 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.2% higher. A report showed inflation at the U.S. wholesale level wasn’t as high last month as economists expected. It’s an encouraging signal ahead of a report coming Wednesday, which will show how much inflation U.S. consumers faced at gasoline pumps, grocery price registers and auto lots in December. Stubbornly high readings on inflation and a run of better-than-expected updates on the U.S. economy have sent Wall Street into a weekslong rut, pulling it further from the dozens of all-time highs set last year. The fear is that all the strong data will convince the Federal Reserve to deliver less relief this year through lower interest rates. The Fed has already hinted it’s likely to cut rates just two times in 2025, down from an earlier projection of four. But speculation is growing about whether the Fed may not cut rates at all this year. Such questions have sent Treasury yields sharply higher in the bond market, which cranks up the pressure on the stock market, but yields slowed their ascent following the update on wholesale inflation. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.79% from 4.78% late Monday after a couple oscillations in the morning. It was below 3.65% in September. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, edged down to 4.37% from 4.39%. On Wall Street, KB Home rose 4% after delivering a better profit for its latest quarter than analysts expected. The rise in Treasury yields has made mortgages more expensive, but CEO Jeffrey Mezger said buyers nevertheless “continued to demonstrate a desire for homeownership and housing market conditions improved relative to last year.” Mezger said faster build times helped the company deliver more homes in the three months through November. H&E Equipment Services more than doubled to top $90 after United Rentals said it will buy its smaller rival for $92 per share in cash. The deal values H&E, which rents aerial work platforms, earthmoving equipment and other products, at $4.8 billion, including roughly $1.4 billion of net debt. United Rentals rose 5.2%. Drops in several Big Tech stocks had weighed down the market through much of the day, before several of them reversed course. Apple and Microsoft both erased earlier losses and were both up 0.1% in afternoon trading. Eli Lilly fell 7.4% after it said it expects to report weaker revenue for the last three months of 2024 than previously forecast. CEO David Ricks said last quarter's 45% growth in Lilly's revenue for its Mounjaro diabetes treatment, Zepbound obesity injections and other products in the incretin market wasn’t as big as expected. Also on the losing end of the market was Signet Jewelers, which tumbled 22.1%. The diamond seller said its sales in the peak shopping days leading up to Christmas this past holiday season were below its forecasts.

Japan’s Nikkei 225 index fell 1.8% following a holiday on Monday, but indexes were much stronger in China where stocks rose 1.8% in Hong Kong and 2.5% in Shanghai. Crude oil prices fell to give back some of their strong gains in recent weeks, which had also been cranking up the pressure on inflation. Benchmark U.S. crude eased 1.1% to $76.49 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 1.2% to $80.07 per barrel. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed. Sign in to access your portfolio

Tech drags down Nasdaq U.S. markets were mixed Monday. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rose, but the Nasdaq Composite fell amid a broad tech sell-off. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index fell 0.55%, with most sectors in negative territory. U.K. borrowing costs ticked higher Monday, raising concerns on public spending cuts or further tax rises. Potential new U.S. Steel bidCleveland Cliffs is partnering with rival Nucor in a potential bid for U.S. Steel, whose takeover by Japan's Nippon Steel was blocked by the White House earlier this month, sources told CNBC's David Faber. The offer would be in the high $30s a share. Nippon had planned to buy U.S. Steel for $55 per share in a deal valued at more than $14 billion. Slowing inflation in IndiaIndia's annual consumer inflation in December came in at 5.22%, according to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. The reading's lower than the 5.30% forecast by a Reuters poll of analysts, and the second straight month that price growth fell. The softer inflation reading offers room to the RBI to cut rates, amid slowing growth in the country. Second blow to quantum stocksQuantum computing stocks sold off Monday after Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on a Friday podcast by Joe Rogan that the technology is "quite a ways off from being a very useful paradigm." The comments reinforce recent commentary from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang that suggested that the computers are likely 15 to 30 years away. [PRO] Rieder would 100% buy the Nasdaq The Nasdaq Composite underperformed other major indexes on Monday as investors rotated out of tech names. BlackRock's Rick Rieder, who is the company's chief investment officer of global fixed income, told CNBC he would "one hundred percent" buy the Nasdaq dip. Rieder explains his decision and how he would deploy downside protection. Tech stocks underperformed on Monday as investors took profit on the victors of 2024 and looked for this year's winner. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 0.38%. Big tech names popular with investors broadly fell in Monday's session. Palantir — the top-performing stock in the S&P last year —slid 3.4%, while Nvidia lost 2%, building upon their losses from last week. Nvidia fell almost 6% during the period, while Palantir lost more than 15%. "That's a necessary part of a corrective phase in our view and we are likely further along in this correction than many investors recognize since many stocks peaked in late November, early December," said AXS Investments CEO Greg Bassuk, adding that Friday's jobs report "cemented" those concerns. However, the S&P 500 inched up 0.16% and the Dow Jones Industrial Index climbed 0.86% as investors rotated into nontech shares such as Amgen, Caterpillar and UnitedHealth. That's not to say those sectors will be taking the mantle of market leader anytime soon — or at all. Sectoral rotation is a common phenomenon in markets, as investors secure their returns and look for the next stocks with upside potential. And the backdrop of rising rates puts more pressure on growth-oriented tech stocks than value stocks, which typically make up the Dow. Furthermore, the artificial intelligence frenzy isn't over, judging by the latest earnings reports from TSMC and Foxconn, which trades as Hon Hai Precision Industry. Both companies saw their revenue boom on high demand for AI-related products. A long-term rotation out of tech and AI isn't likely. But one within the field cannot be dismissed. — CNBC's Samantha Subin, Hakyung Kim and Brian Evans contributed to this report. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks closed mixed on Monday, with Big Tech names paring losses as the dollar and bond yields climbed amid fading hopes for interest rate cuts ahead of this week's key consumer inflation reports. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) settled almost 0.2% higher after falling as much as 1% during the session, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.4%. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) closed off their session lows, though most "Magnificent Seven" tech megacaps fell during the session. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which includes fewer tech stocks, rose 0.8%, or more than 350 points. Stocks navigated another volatile session after Friday's plunge, which wiped out all year-to-date gains for Wall Street's major gauges. A hot December jobs report rattled markets, spurring concern that signs of strength in the economy will encourage the Federal Reserve to keep rates higher for longer. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added to recent gains to touch a 14-month high, trading around 4.8% as US bonds sold off. Meanwhile, the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) surged to a two-year high against major currency peers, with the UK pound (GBPUSD=X), in particular, coming under pressure. As of Monday, traders are betting there will be no rate cut until at least September, per the CME FedWatch tool, and that the Fed will lower borrowing costs by just 30 basis points in the whole of 2025. That has intensified the spotlight on the Consumer Price Index reading for December, due on Wednesday, given one big concern for markets is that inflation won't cool to the central bank's 2% target. Meanwhile, oil prices rose to their highest levels in five months before paring gains after the US imposed tougher sanctions on Russia's crude industry, threatening supply to China and India. Brent (BZ=F) climbed to $81.01 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) settled at $78.82. Elsewhere in corporates, Moderna (MRNA) stock plunged 16% after the biotech giant cut its 2025 sales forecast by $1 billion amid soft demand for vaccines. Stocks ended the session mixed on Monday as Tech led the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lower. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) pared losses to close up almost 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained more than 0.8% as Energy (XLE) stocks and Industrials (XLI) rallied. AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) fell roughly 2% after the Biden administration released an updated export rule aimed at controlling the flow of artificial intelligence to "adversaries" such as China. Shares of Meta (META) and Apple (AAPL) also fell, but closed well off their session lows. Investors scooped up shares of Tesla (TSLA) in the last hour of trading. Shares of the EV giant closed higher after falling as much as 2% earlier in the session. Tech has sold off in recent sessions as the market resets expectations over potential Fed rate cuts following a hotter-than-expected jobs report last Friday. Investors will be paying attention to two key data points this week. Tuesday will bring a reading on wholesale inflation before the more widely followed Consumer Price Index (CPI) is set for release on Wednesday morning. A surge in the US dollar has equity strategists expecting "FX headwinds" and other phrases about the strong dollar to be a heavily discussed topic this earnings season. With the US dollar continuing to strengthen, companies with large international exposure are likely to be discussing how their sales are weakening due to the foreign exchange crossover. But the equity research team at Goldman Sachs found an interesting point about when companies miss sales estimates due to FX headwinds. Their stocks don't underperform the market by nearly as much. Dating back to 2016, the Goldman equity strategy led by David Kostin found that companies who miss sales estimates on a constant currency basis see their stock underperform the market by 3.69% the next day. But if the miss isn't on a constant currency basis, meaning it hasn't been adjusted for the strong dollar, the company's stock only underperforms by 0.69%. So in some ways, the market often sees the headwind as a short-term one and isn't overly judgemental about it. Still, Kostin notes "companies with domestic-facing sales have typically outperformed firms with international-facing revenues in other periods of US dollar strength." Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: Edison International (EIX) — the parent company of the utility Southern California Edison (SCE) — saw its stock drop more than 12% Monday following an announcement from SCE late last week that it's being investigated by California fire authorities for its potential link to the Los Angeles wildfires. SCE said in a statement Friday that the authorities are investigating whether its equipment "was involved in the ignition" of one of the wildfires in Los Angeles. The utility said one of its power lines fell Jan. 7 but that it "does not know whether the damage observed occurred before or after the start of the fire." Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports: Shake Shack (SHAK) posted preliminary fourth quarter results that beat expectations, but investors don't seem convinced. Shares of the fast-casual chain fell 6% on Monday after the company reported same-store sales grew by 4.3% last quarter. Total revenue jumped around 15% year over year to $328.7 million. Shake Shack made a "lot of progress" this past year "in an environment where you still have concerns around wage inflation and potentially some commodity inflation, and you've got some risks that are kind of popping up here over the last few weeks [like the bird flu]," CEO Rob Lynch told Yahoo Finance at the ICR conference in Orlando, Fla. For 2025, it projects to expand restaurant margins to 22% from 21.4%, the highest margin in the last eight years. Read more here. Shares of Honeywell (HON) rose as much as 4% before paring gains on Monday after Bloomberg reported the industrial conglomerate is on track to proceed with a breakup amid pressure from activist investor Elliott Investment Management. In December Honeywell said it was exploring strategic alternatives to unlock shareholder value, including separating its aerospace business. Honeywell is expected give an update on progress made when it reports its fourth quarter earnings on Febr 6. Shares of US Steel (X) jumped following news reports that rivals Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) and Nucor (NUE) are considering making a joint bid for the iconic steel-maker just weeks after the Biden administration blocked a takeover of the Pittsburg-based company by Japan's Nippon Steel. As part of the offer, Cleveland-Cliffs would buy US Steel in cash and then sell the company's Big River Steel mill in Arkansas to Nucor, according to people familiar with the matter as reported by the Financial Times. News of the joint bid consideration was first reported by CNBC. Cleveland-Cliffs reportedly plans to offer less than $40 a share to buy US Steel, far less than the $55 a share that Nippon Steel had agreed to pay for the company last year before the Biden administration blocked the merger citing national security concerns. US Steel stock jumped more than 5% on the news, while shares of Nucor and Cleveland-Cliffs also rose. Stocks came off their session lows by 1:00 p.m. ET on Monday with the major averages mixed. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) pared losses to fall more than 0.2% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped 0.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.5%. Tech stocks lagged as investors rotated out of the sector. EV giant Tesla (TSLA) erased losses of more than 2% to briefly flip above the flatline. AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) fell more than 2%. Social media company Meta (META) and iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) both fell more than 1%. Oil extended gains to a five-month high on Monday as worries grew over supply disruptions impacting big importers China and India from wide-ranging sanctions against Russian crude. West Texas Intermediate crude (CL=F) rose roughly 2% to trade above $78 per barrel while Brent crude futures (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, surpassed $81, the highest level since August. The move higher comes after an almost 4% surge on Friday in reaction to wide-ranging sanctions against Moscow imposed by the US, targeting oil executives, traders, and more than 180 vessels, bringing the total number of ships sanctioned to 451, according to JPMorgan analysis. "There are indications that, similar to Indian refiners who avoid taking Russian oil in tankers under sanctions or in ships insured by sanctioned Russian insurers, China is also becoming a less-permissive buyer," wrote JPMorgan analysts in a recent note. Bitcoin (BTC-US) fell 3% over the past 24 hours to hover just below $92,000 per token. Enthusiasm for the token has waned in recent days as risk assets have sold off amid rising US Treasury yields and a higher US Dollar. Meanwhile bitcoin proxy MicroStrategy (MSTR) bought about 2,530 tokens for $243 million between Jan.6 and Jan. 12, according to the company's latest filing. The company currently holds approximately 450,000 bitcoins. MicroStrategy stock slumped 4% on Monday. 'Magnificent 7' stocks led the tech sell-off on Monday as investor optimism over Federal Reserve rate cuts this year began to fade ahead of a highly anticipated inflation print this week. AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) fell roughly 3% after the Biden administration released an updated export rule aimed at controlling the flow of artificial intelligence to "adversaries" such as China. EV maker Tesla (TSLA) retreated around 1% while social media platform Meta (META) and iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) both shed more than 2%. Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) posted smaller drops. Tech stocks extended their declines from Friday, which came as a hotter-than-expected jobs report dashed hopes that the Fed would cut rates at least two times this year. Investors expect policymakers to shift any easing to the fall at the earliest. Growth stocks lost ground as the yield on the 10-year Treasury (^TNX) ticked higher and the US Dollar Index (DX-Y.NYB) rose to its highest level since 2022. Shares of UnitedHealth (UNH) rose nearly 4% on Monday morning, helping lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) into positive territory in early trading. UnitedHealth, along with other insurers like Humana (HUM), rose after Medicare released a proposal that would allow for bigger-than-expected payments for insurance companies in 2026. Shares of CVS Health (CVS) also rallied. Moderna (MRNA) shares sank 23% at the open on Monday after the biotech giant lowered its 2025 sales guidance by $1 billion because of weak demand for its COVID-19 vaccines and a slower adoption of its new respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) shot. The company said it expects revenue in 2025 to come in anywhere between $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion after hitting as much as $3.1 billion last year. Stocks opened lower on Monday, with tech leading the losses as optimism over interest rate cuts this year continued to fade and bond yields rose. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) sank 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped 1.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell about 0.1%. Stocks continued their sell-off from Friday's plunge, which wiped out all year-to-date gains for the major averages. A hot December jobs report spooked the markets, as investors faced the possibility that the Federal Reserve will make just two rate cuts this year. Among Monday's laggards, shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) slid more than 3% and 2%, respectively, as the "Magnificent Seven" group lost ground in the market sell-off. Economic data: New York Fed one-year inflation expectations (December) Earnings: KB Home (KBH) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed over the weekend and early this morning: The optimism over US banks is about to be put to the test Biden plans to tighten AI chip export rules Treasury sell-off ripples through world markets Elizabeth Warren has 180 questions for Trump Treasury pick Bessent TSMC fourth quarter profit seen jumping 58% on strong AI chip demand Moderna stock tumbles after cut to 2025 sales view Canada Has Counter-Tariffs Ready If Trump Launches Trade War, Trudeau Says Investors awake to markets continuing their post-red-hot jobs report tantrum. The rise in yields and now the rise in energy prices remain in focus. Both of these things happening at the same time is the worst possible scenario for the bulls. At the time of this writing, premarket weakness is being seen in top momentum names such as Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA). Important point this morning by the Goldman Sachs team: "The move in rates is also now tightening financial conditions such that it may weigh on growth and risk assets. Positions that benefit from lower US yields now look more attractive, especially for portfolios that already embrace the US growth theme." Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: ‘Fact-Checking Is A Good Thing!’ CNN’s Jim Acosta Praises Biden For Slamming ‘Shameful’ Zuckerberg Move

CNN anchor Jim Acosta and media correspondent Brian Stelter praised President Joe Biden on Monday for slamming Mark Zuckerberg’s “shameful” decision to end fact-checking on Facebook. Zuckerberg’s decision to end Meta’s fact-checking program drew a rebuke from Biden on Friday, when he told reporters “The idea that, you know, a billionaire can buy something and say, ‘By the way, we’re not gonna fact check anything,’ and you know, you have millions of people reading, going online, reading this stuff, it is– Anyway, I think it’s really shameful.” On Monday’s edition of CNN Newsroom With Jim Acosta, Acosta and Stelter defended the Biden administration against Zuckerberg’s recent complaints, and agreed with Biden that the fact-checking move was “really shameful” because “We’ve got to have facts in this society”: JIM ACOSTA: Brian, this is the same man who banned Trump from Facebook and Instagram in 2021. I was at the White House the day that he was kicked off of Twitter. A lot has changed. What a difference four years makes. BRIAN STELTER: And I’m glad you brought that up. It was Zuckerberg. It was Facebook that banned Trump from the platform, just as Twitter did. And now here we are. And there’s very much a MAGA makeover of Meta happening. Look, I heard a business analyst describe Zuckerberg as a really effective shapeshifter, and I think that’s a great phrase for what is happening. Zuckerberg is shifting because he believes that’s what’s best for his shareholders. And remember, he owns 13% of Meta. He is a billionaire many times over thanks to that stock price that’s been on a tear lately. So he is trying to evolve the company to make sure it is successful in the Trump years. And that means, number one, being cozy to Trump, to the president-elect, keeping it in the good graces of the government, maybe making that pesky FTC antitrust case go away. It has a lot of business before the U.S. government. And I think that’s ultimately what this is all about. JIM ACOSTA: Yeah, and he’s complaining about the Biden administration, you know, yelling at them to say, you know, get some of this Covid misinformation off their platforms. I mean, isn’t that that’s sort of what the White House should be doing, right? I mean, tell folks to get this garbage off these platforms, if you can, as best as you can– to get rid of fact checking altogether, especially during these wildfires. I mean, that sounds like something that could really, you know, backfire big-time. BRIAN STELTER: It’s just so easy for years later to sit around and say, you know, they were pressuring us. We went too far during an emergency, right? The early months of the Covid pandemic were an emergency unlike anything that we’ve lived through before. And were there some mistakes? Were there some screw ups? Were there some poor decisions? Of course. But it’s so easy to sit back and claim that now, as opposed to honestly reflect on what happened. And I think so much of this debate about free speech, you know, acts as if it’s very simple, when in fact, many of these operations are very complex. Ultimately, it’s about values. And I was so struck, Jim, by President Biden kind of shaming Meta the other day, shaming Zuckerberg and saying that it was shameful to remove the fact checkers. Biden obviously valuing fact, checking, even though he was often fact jacked during his four years in office. JIM ACOSTA: Right. I mean, Fact-checking is a good thing! It’s not a bad thing! And Brian, I mean, is that correct that they’re just not going to have fact checking altogether on these very powerful platforms? BRIAN STELTER: All of Meta’s, financing of fact checking is going away effective in March and it’ll be replaced by community notes, you know, letting users police themselves and decide what is true and false. It’s going to result in a much more chaotic and confusing information environment. And that’s ultimately the big picture about what this is about and why it matters. And that’s what Biden was getting at in his recent interview with USA Today. He said his biggest regret as president was not being able to navigate this changing information environment. We’ve heard some of his cabinet secretaries say the same thing, that they feel like they’re outmatched in this environment. Ultimately, when we’re talking about facts versus fiction, we should ask who benefits from the fictions? Who benefits from an environment where there are more lies, more propaganda, more innuendo spreading? And who suffers? You know, that’s the kind of cost benefit analysis that I think Zuckerberg is kind of trying to avoid as he curry favor with the incoming administration. JIM ACOSTA: Yeah, fact checking is not always popular, but it is necessary. We’ve got to have facts in this society. Watch above via CNN Newsroom With Jim Acosta. Have a tip or story idea? Email us.

Title: Nvidia Slams Biden ‘Overreach’ And Praises Trump—As AI Stock Enters Correction Territory

Full Content:
Nvidia blasted the Biden administration and hyped President-elect Donald Trump in a Monday press release reacting to more export restrictions targeting Nvidia’s highly sought-after artificial intelligence chips, a criticism coinciding with a rare down stretch on Wall Street for Nvidia—and mounting Silicon Valley support for Trump. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris discuss AI in 2023. President Joe Biden announced Monday a framework to govern the transfer of AI technology most famously designed by Nvidia to cap AI chip sales abroad at both the country and company levels, a move which the White House characterized as an effort to keep away the advanced AI systems out of the hands of “countries of concern” as Biden has voiced concern about China’s use of American-made AI throughout his presidency. The potential for limited exports poses a potential headache for Nvidia, as China, Singapore and Taiwan accounted for more than half of the company’s $35 billion in revenue during its most recent financial quarter, with China alone accounting for $5.4 billion of Nvidia’s quarterly sales. Nvidia lashed out against the rules in a strongly worded statement: “The new Biden rules would only weaken America’s global competitiveness, undermining the innovation that has kept the U.S. ahead,” clapped back Ned Finkle, Nvidia’s vice president of government affairs, arguing it’s an attempt from the White House “to rig market outcomes and stifle competition.” The Nvidia response also indicated a warm attitude toward Trump, as Finkle wrote the “first Trump Administration laid the foundation” for the recent AI revolution. Nvidia looks “forward to a return to policies that strengthen American leadership, bolster our economy and preserve our competitive edge in AI and beyond,” Finkle added. Shares of Nvidia fell as much as 4.7% to $129.51 shortly after market open, as pressure on its abroad business accelerated its recent stock market slump. The stock was down more than 15% from its all-time-high share price set last week, erasing as much as $578 billion in market capitalization from its $3.75 trillion valuation peak set Tuesday morning. Other big technology stocks struggled Monday, with shares of Alphabet, Apple and Tesla all declining at least 1% as the S&P 500 benchmark index sank to its lowest level since early November. Much of Nvidia’s stock surge came while Biden was in office. The company’s share price is up 880% since Biden’s 2021 inauguration, compared to a 414% rally during Trump’s first term, according to FactSet data. Nvidia is far from the first big tech firm to express excitement about the prospects of Trump’s second term, with the likes of Amazon and Alphabet committing $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund as industry leaders like Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Amazon chairman Jeff Bezos all met with Trump following his November election win. Zuckerberg also announced sweeping changes to Meta’s policies ahead of Trump’s inauguration: The company is ditching fact-checks in favor of X-style community notes, and Trump ally Dana White will join the board. Trump’s administration includes the newly-created role of “White House AI & Crypto Czar,” filled by Silicon Valley venture capitalist David Sacks, in an effort to make the U.S. “the clear global leader” in AI and cryptocurrency, Trump said in December. Nvidia is the face of the 2020s generative AI boom, as it designs a majority of the data-intensive hardware and software systems used to train AI technology like OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot and Tesla’s self-driving programs.

Title: There’s a reason why it feels like the internet has gone bad | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: A version of this story appeared in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Facebook is full of AI slop. X is full of “free thinkers” peddling conspiracies. Google’s search results are telling us to eat rocks. More and more, it feels like the internet has gone bad. There’s an increasingly popular theory about why: “enshittification.” The term, coined in 2022 by the author, journalist and activist Cory Doctorow, refers broadly to the deterioration of services (especially online) as a result of giant companies extracting maximum profits from their customers. In a 2023 essay for Wired, Doctorow laid out the basic arc of enshittification, or the process by which platforms die. “First, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then, they die.” In other words: Products are good when they first hit the market, because companies need to lock in as many consumers as they can to achieve the huge scale they desire. Once everyone’s using the product, the company refocuses on creating value for business partners, padding its profit margins and letting the product corrode. Eventually, the company maxes out what it can extract from its business partners, too, and the whole thing fades into obsolescence. Once you wrap your head around the idea, you start to see enshittification all around — not only online, but across the economy, in services that have been picked over by private equity (vet clinics, nursing homes, prisons, countless other industries) or in the products peddled by highly concentrated industries. The Australian dictionary Macquarie even crowned it the 2024 word of the year, noting its power to capture “what many of us feel is happening to the world and to so many aspects of our lives at the moment.” On Tuesday, shortly after Meta’s CEO announced a widely criticized plan to dispense with fact-checkers, I spoke with Doctorow about the future of social media and how “enshittification” can help us make sense of our collective online angst. The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. Nightcap: Could you give me your your cocktail-party-level introduction to “enshittification”? Cory Doctorow: I think of enshittification as a theory about what happens when you have power without consequence. We have increased the power available to large firms for a long time by reducing our antitrust enforcement, allowing mergers, predatory pricing, all the conduct that allows firms to get very big. That’s been across the board, not just with tech. Nightcap: What does that look like, in real life? Doctorow: There’s a law, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, that makes it illegal to break digital rights management. So for example, if Audible (which is owned by Amazon) sells you one of my audiobooks, they require that it have digital rights management that locks it to Audible’s platform forever — you can’t unlock it, quit Audible and take your books with you. And if I give you a tool to jailbreak the audiobook so you can go somewhere else, I commit a felony punishable by a five-year prison sentence and a $500,000 fine. So even though I am the rights holder to that work, Amazon, the intermediary who sold you the work, has more intellectual-property rights to that work than I do. This is a law that is oriented around allowing these large firms to wield regulation against competitors, against their own workforce and against their users so that they can maintain power. It’s a collapse of discipline — they don’t have to worry about their workers, they don’t have to worry about regulators. And they bought all their competitors. Nightcap: Meta would seem like a kind of textbook case of enshittification. Facebook used to feel like a premium service, but the last few years it’s felt like it’s lost the plot. Doctorow: Meta is a great example because they go through this pretty neat set of stages… They had this very straightforward value prop, which was like, just tell us who matters to you, and we’ll show you everything they post. And their pitch to the general public was, Facebook is like MySpace, but we won’t spy on you. Nightcap: Right, that feels very much like aughts-era Facebook, when we could all just see our friends and enjoy the virtual connection. What changed? Doctorow: Facebook at a certain point goes to publishers and says, create a Facebook page, post short excerpts to it, don’t worry about how many people follow you — we’re going to recommend it to users. So we’re going to show users things that they never asked to see in order to take some value away from them and give it to publishers. You see the same thing with advertisers. Facebook not only offers to use surveillance data to benefit advertisers in the form of targeting, but they also invest heavily in anti-ad-fraud and in services to advertisers. So if your ads are not performing, they’ll help you figure it out, but also, if someone’s ripping you off, they’ll help you get your money back. And so you see the users getting locked in by each other. They’re providing so much value to each other that they can’t bring themselves to leave, even as the service is getting monotonically worse. And that’s as far as I think a lot of people take it — “Facebook’s got a mind control ray, they’re hacking your dopamine loops, and you can’t escape Facebook and they’re gonna sell you to advertisers.” The evidence for “hacking your dopamine loops” is pretty thin. There’s much better evidence that people just care about their friends more than they hate Mark Zuckerberg, and so they stay there. Nightcap: Your theory adds a third step here, where Facebook also turns its back on advertisers, too? Doctorow: Right, once the advertisers were fully committed to a Facebook strategy, advertising got way more expensive and the amount of ad fraud you got was crazy. So the advertisers are getting screwed, the publishers are getting screwed, the end users are getting screwed. Nightcap: I’m not asking you to look into a crystal ball here, but if you had to speculate, what’s next for Facebook or other decaying platforms? Doctorow: Zuckerberg is insulated from the consequences of making bad choices until he’s not, right? Until things reach a breaking point, and then he tends to panic. Tech calls these panics “pivots,” but they’re just the outcome of being the CEO of a company that posts anemic growth or even a contraction in its user base and sees (Wall Street) just go nuts on you. First, it was the Metaverse… which is like a not-very-successful video game that they spent billions on. Zuck could do that because he controls the majority of the voting shares and because he had huge cash reserves. And now we’re seeing these weird announcements that they’re going to have AI -generated users who are going to interact with you. This is, again, a visibly terrible idea. It could be a way to continue to post growth if users will tolerate it. But the equilibrium that Zuck has shot for, with Facebook and with Instagram, has been a service that is nearly so bad that people want to leave. The anthropologist danah boyd describes how in the last days of MySpace, she could see how when one person who a lot of people talk to would leave, then a whole bunch of people would follow. It wasn’t the only reason they were there, but it was the last thing keeping them there, and then, boom, the bottom falls out and the net just starts to unravel. This is where Facebook is. They are trying to maintain this equilibrium where they extract enough that they keep their shareholders happy, but not so much that people leave. They’re now at the end of a long run of extremely bad choices. I’m not shorting Meta stock, but I think that they are on the path to becoming a kind of zombie — something like MySpace is today. You know, MySpace still exists. You can go to MySpace. It’s just AI-generated slop and and spam. (Note: Meta didn’t respond to Nightcap’s request for comment.) Nightcap: How are you feeling about the future of tech? Doctorow: In terms of the future of enshittification, these platforms that have hollowed themselves out, where there’s just no value left in them except this kind of awful lock-in. It’s the old “we go broke a little, and then all at once.” I do think there is reason to be hopeful. As a science fiction writer, I know that prediction is a mug’s game. But as an activist, I’m like, well, you take the weakest flank where you can make the biggest strategic advance, and you march on that flank. And there are a lot of weak flanks in global big tech. I’d say the last one is the potential for an alliance between people who are angry about other kinds of monopolies, because it’s not just tech — people are really angry about grocery monopolies and oil monopolies, sea freight monopolies, eyeglass monopolies. One company, EssilorLuxottica, owns every eyewear brand you’ve ever heard of and every eyewear store you’ve ever shopped at, and they make more than 50% of the lenses, and they own EyeMed, the largest insurer in the world, and they’ve raised the price of glasses 1,000% in the last decade. (EssilorLuxottica didn’t respond to Nightcap’s request for comment.) So people are pissed off about monopolies. And if they can make a coalition, it’ll be like when we discovered the word “ecology” in the ’70s — we realized that just because you care about owls and I care about the ozone layer, it doesn’t mean we’re not caring about the same thing. Every time you see the world change all of a sudden, it’s because a new coalition has popped up. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL Wireless Gen 3 is a solid gaming keyboard that’s effortless to use. The analog switches with their adjustable actuation points work well in practice, thanks to the feedback they provide. However, this is a rather specialist feature that not every gamer will want or need, and given the hefty price tag, there are better value wireless gaming keyboards out there. Excellent gaming performance Analog switches work well Premium build quality Expensive Lacking some analog tweaks Typing not the best Why you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you’re buying the best. Find out more about how we test. The SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL Wireless Gen 3 is the latest incarnation in the brand’s line of elite gaming keyboards, with various improvements for even better gaming performance. The looks downplay its gaming prowess, with the RGB lighting and floating keycaps being the only signals in this regard. Still, it looks smart and sophisticated, and the build quality is excellent. It’s quite thick yet not as heavy as you might expect. Every aspect of its built feels premium, right down to the included wrist pad, which is soft yet durable; it’s easily on a par with the best gaming keyboard out there. The double shot PBT keycaps also feel great, with a pleasantly grainy texture. There are various keyboard shortcuts available by default, accessible via SteelSeries’ Meta modifier key (essentially a function key). These include altering the global actuation point, toggling rapid trigger, changing profiles, recording macros, and switching between three Bluetooth devices. Similar functions can also be found on the OLED screen in the top right corner of the Apex Pro, with navigation achieved via a dedicated button and the volume wheel. This screen can also be customized in SteelSeries’ GG software, letting you upload images and GIFs to display, and can be used to view system and in-game information. Overall GG is easy to use and offers plenty of other customizations to sink your teeth into. There are various keyboard shortcuts to configure, although the system-level functions are lacking somewhat. There are also default profiles for certain games, including Counter-Strike 2, DOTA 2, Minecraft and League of Legends. You can set binds to activate on press or release, and the dual actuation mode lets you assign two binds to a single key, each one activated depending on how hard you press, which works effectively. It’s a shame, though, that there’s no visual feedback to show how your actuation settings work in practice. When it comes to gaming, the Apex Pro really shines: the clack of key presses is very satisfying, the indented keycaps provide a planted finger position, and the bottom row is easy to access thanks to the slope of the keycaps. The layout is quite compact, but I still found it manageable. The switches offer fast yet smooth performance, and hitting certain actuation points is easy thanks to their feel. It is a shame, however, there aren’t more settings available to emulate the analog control of a gamepad. Also, the wrist rest also cuts off abruptly with no downwards slope, so my palm hung off the edge awkwardly while in the WASD position. Without it, though, I found the keys were raised too high to reach without adopting a more fingertip-oriented position. Typing with the Apex Pro isn’t the best experience either. I personally prefer shallower keycaps, and I found gliding around on the Apex Pro awkward. There’s no doubt the Apex Pro is a premium piece of hardware, and it commands a premium price tag. It may not be as expensive as some of its rivals, such as the Razer BlackWidow V4 Pro 75%, but it runs close. There are cheaper gaming keyboards with analog switches, such as the Turtle Beach Vulcan 2 TKL Pro, although this is wired only and can’t quite match the Apex Pro for performance. So if you’ve got the money to spend, the Apex Pro is hard to top for an analog keyboard. The Apex Pro costs $269 / £259 (about AU$456) and is available now in black only. It comes with a wrist pad and replacement keycaps can be purchased from SteelSeries’ website. A mini version is also available which loses the OLED screen, and a full-size variant adds a number pad as well as a larger scroll wheel and screen button. The Apex Pro sits atop the market in terms of price, eclipsing some of Razer’s best offerings, for instance. Although not quite as pricey as the BlackWidow V4 Pro 75%, it’s more expensive than the Huntsman V2 Analog, our pick as the best gaming keyboard. What sets that board apart is the 360-degree motion of the switches keys, letting you mimic an analog stick on a gamepad even more closely. It’s wired only, though. If you’re looking for another analog keyboard, then the Turtle Beach Vulcan 2 TKL Pro is considerably less expensive than the Apex Pro. Although it’s wired only and has some issues with its analog implementation, the Vulcan 2 is still a worthy contender in the sector. Value: 3 / 5 The Apex Pro looks understated for a gaming keyboard. The totally black design is bereft of the brash trappings common in the sector, so at first glance you’ll struggle to identify its intended audience. The floating keycaps, though, are a giveaway, as is the opulent RGB lighting. There’s no denying the Apex Pro has a premium aura, though. It’s also substantial, with a thick, two-tiered chassis, but fortunately it isn’t as heavy as it looks. The build quality is impeccable, with every material, join and key feeling smooth and sturdy. The double-shot PBT keycaps are lightly textured and feel great under your fingers. They’re quite thick and sit high above the board, allowing for deep presses. If they aren’t to your liking, though, they can be swapped out, and a puller is included. The layout is also quite compact, which I had to get used to, but it didn’t take long to adapt. The wrist pad is similarly well-built yet pleasingly light, with a smooth rubberized layer that’s both durable and comfortable. It connects magnetically to the board itself, and although the connection is quite weak, it suffices. There are several default hotkeys on the Apex Pro, accessible with SteelSeries’ own modifier key, called the Meta key. These include global adjustments for the actuation point and rapid trigger function, as well changing profiles, recording macros, and switching between three Bluetooth devices. However, more detailed settings and customizations are available via the Engine tool within the GG software. All keys can be remapped, and can be set to trigger on press or release. There’s a good selection of actions, including profile switching, keyboard setting adjustments and app launching. There are also OS shortcuts that can be mapped, including a selection of media keys and copy and paste, but there aren’t many more than this; those in other peripheral software are more numerous. GG also allows you to set actuation points ranging from 0.1mm to 4mm for all main keys. You can also toggle rapid trigger for each individual key, which, as GG explains, dynamically alters the actuation point when spamming, allowing for rapid-twitch movements. It even has a dual binding mode, allowing a single key to have two different binds, depending on the primary and secondary actuation points of your choosing. For the most part, GG is easy to use with a clear layout and some explanations for various settings. However, it would’ve been nice to see some visual feedback when adjusting actuation points and rapid trigger modes, as some of the Apex Pro’s rivals offer with their own software. Nestled in the top right corner of the Apex Pro is a small monotone OLED screen, called the Smart Screen. It displays battery life by default, but can be customized in GG to display anything from your own images and GIFs, to system and in-game information. The options available for the latter are quite in depth. For instance, you can choose to display certain information at certain increments, and choose various screens to cycle through, each displaying their own unique information at various points. Supported games include Counter-Strike 2, DOTA 2, Minecraft, and League of Legends. There’s also a button on the screen that can be used to control media playback, such as play / pause and next / previous functions. You can enter a menu by holding this button down for a few seconds, from which more settings and functions are available: you can change the brightness of the RGB illumination, toggle between three of your connected Bluetooth devices, and change the global actuation point and rapid trigger functions. Navigation in this menu is achieved with the volume wheel acting as a scroller, and it’s responsive and effective. Design & features: 4 / 5 The gaming performance of the Apex Pro is excellent. The stock keycaps are nicely indented, allowing you to maintain a secure position, and presses are weighted just right, allowing for easy actuation that provides pleasant feedback. Reaching the CTRL key and spacebar is also easy, thanks to the slight incline of the keycaps. The switches are silky smooth and well lubed, offering plenty of clack without being too loud. I also found it relatively easy to hit certain actuation points, as the Hall-effect magnetic switches have more feel and resistance than others I’ve tried, such as those on the Turtle Beach Vulcan 2 TKL Pro. This makes the Apex Pro ideal for rapid trigger functionality or dual binding. SteelSeries has also implemented a new Protection mode, which prevents keys adjacent to the intended one from accidentally triggering by reducing their sensitivity momentarily, which is a useful feature. Where it does miss a trick, however, is the ability to map the keys to an analog stick. This would make for smoother character movements and vehicle control, and is something that can be done with the aforementioned Turtle Beach Vulcan 2 TKL Pro, as well as the Razer Huntsman V2 Analog. As someone who prefers shallow keycaps for typing, I didn’t find the Apex Pro well suited for productivity purposes. Although adjusting the actuation point can help to prevent typos, the relatively thick keycaps and their deep indentations aren’t conducive to gliding around the board. The included wrist pad is pretty much essential for typing comfortably, as the thick body forces your wrists to bend awkwardly without one. Thankfully, the one included offers enough support and padding to make both typing and gaming more comfortable. The wrist pad can be more cumbersome when gaming, though. As the backend tails off abruptly with no slope, the area where your wrist meets your palm tends to overhang when in the WASD position, which is a strange and not entirely comfortable sensation. I did find that I could game without the pad, but I had to adapt my fingers so they were more perpendicular to the key caps, emphasizing more contact with the fingertips. If this is your preferred playing style anyway, then you shouldn’t have a problem. Steelseries claims a battery life of up 40 hours over Bluetooth, or 37.5 hours via the 2.4GHz dongle. During my tests I found this to be accurate, as I was able to get several days use out of it. Performance: 4.5 / 5 You want analog keysAnalog keys aren’t all that common, so if you want changeable sensitivity and rapid trigger functionality, this could be the board for you. You want top-tier performanceGaming with the Apex Pro is sublime, thanks to its smooth and fast performance. Actuation points are easy to hit and the rapid trigger works well. You’re on a budgetYou’ll be hard pressed to find many gaming keyboards that perform better than this, but it’ll cost you. You want controller emulationAlthough the switches are analog, you can’t emulate a gamepad’s triggers or analog sticks as you can with some other analog boards. Razer Huntsman V2 AnalogIf you must have an analog keyboard, then the Huntsman V2 Analog is another fine example in this category. Razer claims that the analog inputs can work with any controller-based game, allowing for ultra-smooth inputs. Uniquely, the keys also feature 360-degree movement, emulating a joystick more closely. The Huntsman V2 Analog can be had for slightly less than the Apex Pro, although if you hunt around you may be able to find a better deal. Read our Razer Huntsman V2 Analog review. Turtle Beach Vulcan 2 TKL ProIf you still want analog switches but want to save even more cash, then the Vulcan 2 TKL Pro could fit the bill. It also lets you emulate the triggers and analog sticks of a gamepad, although the implementation isn’t as seamless as you might imagine. Still, it can have its uses. Read our Turtle Beach Vulcan 2 TKL Pro review. I tested the Apex Pro for about a week. During that time I used it for gaming, productivity and general use. I played various games, including Counter-Strike 2 and I Am Your Beast, which were useful for testing the actuation points and rapid trigger functionality. I also made sure to make use of every feature and function available via the GG software where possible. I have been PC gaming for over 10 years, and have experienced numerous keyboards during that time, spanning various switch types, key profiles, and form factors. I have also reviewed multiple gaming keyboards from a mixture of brands. Lewis Maddison is a Reviews Writer for TechRadar.

Title: Meta has absolutely no clue what to do with AI

But it really wants in. Here’s why Meta is jamming AI into everything When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Meta has managed to cause controversy with its AI push yet again, after Instagram started showing users AI-generated pictures of themselves in their feeds. Shortly after redditor u/Green_Video_9831 used Meta AI to edit a selfie with Instagram’s 'Imagine Me' feature, he was startled to find his own face staring back at him from an AI-generated hall of mirrors in a targeted post on his feed. It seems that the company that recently brought you fake Instagram profiles, and fake Facebook chatbots of fake celebrities is now crossing new frontiers by bringing you a fake… you. When it was posted to the subreddit r/ABoringDystopia, the story quickly went viral, with users piling on scorn and disgust. When I saw this story, I was alarmed by the revolting tackiness of it all, but I wasn’t surprised. A very clear pattern has emerged in Meta’s behaviour – the company is going all-in on AI, but has no real idea what to do with it, what users want from it, or – crucially – how to make any money off it. But the war to be the best social media platform grinds on, shareholders demand their quarterly treats, and AI is still the hottest buzzword on the block. So, Meta is jamming AI into everything, throwing it all at the wall in the desperate hope that something, anything, manages to stick. I might be wrong, and if that’s the case then I encourage Mark Zuckerberg to come down here and community note my ass. But I don’t think I am. There’s a cycle that’s been playing out for literal years at this point: 1. Meta announces a big, splashy new AI feature 2. Users either revolt, make fun of it, or simply ignore it. 3. Meta quietly retires the feature. Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors. 4. Go to 1. By far the biggest boondoggle so far has been the aforementioned celebrity AI chatbots. I wouldn’t blame you if you’ve already forgotten about it, so here’s a refresher. In late 2023, Meta announced that it would be bringing a host of AI assistant chatbots featuring various famous faces. Users would be able to have their questions answered by the likes of Snoop Dogg, MrBeast, Paris Hilton, Kendall Jenner and more. And where are they now, you ask? The whole thing was a disaster, users hated it, and the chatbots were boxed within less than a year. I never even saw them, because they were nixed before launching in the UK. It’s easy just to dismiss this whole sorry episode as another of Meta’s silly failed ventures – another Metaverse fashion week. But just think for a moment about how much it must have cost. One thing that unites Snoop Dogg, Paris Hilton, MrBeast and Kendall Jenner is that while they can be bought easily, they cannot be bought cheaply. And there were twenty-eight such celebs in this thing! Even at the most conservative estimates, it must have cost tens of millions, for absolutely zero return. I confidently predict that this latest feature – the ‘Imagined for You’ selfies that put u/Green_Video_9831 into a hall of mirrors – is going to go the exact same way. I’m not blind to the cute novelty factor of it – I’m sure you can imagine yourself enjoying seeing a pretty realistic-looking photo of yourself on the surface of Mars or in Blade Runner or whatever. But can you imagine yourself enjoying that more than once or twice? Can you imagine enjoying that on a regular enough basis that it significantly juices Meta’s engagement metrics? Can you imagine yourself paying for it? Even when you’re not paying Snoop Dogg money, generative AI is not a cheap technology. Those godawful fake Instagram profiles (remember Liv, the "proud Black queer momma of 2 & truth-teller”?) were not cheap to make, none of it is, and I firmly believe that Meta has no path to profitability with this stuff. If this all feels like a flailing tech giant desperately seeking to stay on top of the pile by burning money to over-leverage on underdeveloped technology that can’t really do the things they’re saying it can do – well, that’s because it is. And sure, Meta has a lot of money to burn. But nothing is infinite. At some point, they're going to hit the limits of what they can spend on this stuff without making any return. What comes after that? I don't know! I don't think Meta knows either, and I think the company is really, really hoping that it doesn't have to find out. Still, maybe I’m wrong. Maybe in six months’ time we’ll all be Imagining Ourselves in halls of mirrors all day and all night. Indeed, it’s entirely possible that Meta knows exactly what it is doing with AI and is just about to announce the one killer AI app that everybody simply has to have. I’m sure that’s just around the corner – but for now, I’m off to jack into the metaverse (now with legs) and check on the value of my Instagram NFT. I’m sure they’re both doing great.

Title: S&P’s $18 trillion rally threatened by psychology of 5% yields

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- For years it’s seemed like nothing could stop the stock market’s inexorable march higher, as the S&P 500 Index soared more than 50% from the start of 2023 to the end of 2024, adding $18 trillion in value in the process. Now, however, Wall Street is seeing what can ultimately derail this rally: Treasury yields above 5%. Most Read from Bloomberg A Blueprint for Better Bike Lanes What Robotaxis Brought San Francisco Ambitious High-Speed Rail Plans Advance in the Baltic Region New York, San Francisco Ranked Worst for US Traffic in City Centers Equities traders have shrugged off the bond market’s warnings for months, focusing instead on the windfall from President-elect Donald Trump’s promised tax cuts and the seemingly limitless possibilities of artificial intelligence. But the risk came into focus last week as Treasury yields climbed toward their ominous milestones and share prices sank in response. The yield on 20-year US Treasuries breached 5% on Wednesday and jumped back above on Friday, reaching the highest since Nov. 2, 2023. Meanwhile, 30-year US Treasuries briefly crossed 5% on Friday to the highest since Oct. 31, 2023. Those yields have risen roughly 100 basis points since mid-September, when the Federal Reserve started reducing the fed funds rate, which has come down 100 basis points over the same time. “It is unusual,” Jeff Blazek, co-CIO of multi-asset strategies at Neuberger Berman, said of the dramatic and rapid jump in bond yields in the early months of an easing cycle. Over the past 30 years, intermediate and longer-term yields have been relatively flat or modestly higher in the months after the Fed initiated a string of rate cuts, he added. Traders are watching the policy-sensitive 10-year Treasury yield, which is the highest it’s been since October 2023 and is rapidly approaching 5%, a level they fear could spark a stock market correction. It last passed the threshold briefly in October 2023, and before that you have to go back to July 2007. “If the 10-year hits 5% there will be a knee-jerk reaction to sell stocks,” said Matt Peron, Janus Henderson’s global head of solutions. “Episodes like this take weeks or maybe a few months to play out, and over the course of that the S&P 500 could get to down 10%.” The reason is fairly simple. Rising bond yields make returns on Treasuries more attractive, while also increasing the cost of raising capital for companies. The spillover into the stock market was apparent on Friday, as the S&P 500 tumbled 1.5% for its worst day since mid-December, turned negative for 2025, and came close to wiping out all the gains from the November euphoria sparked by Trump’s election. Building Barriers While there’s “no magic” to the fixation on 5% beyond round-number psychology, perceived barriers can create “technical barriers,” said Kristy Akullian, Blackrock’s head of iShares investment strategy. Meaning, a swift move in yields can make it difficult for stocks to rise. Investors are already seeing how. The earnings yield for the S&P 500 is sitting 1 percentage point below what’s offered by 10-year Treasuries, a development last seen in 2002. In other words, the return on owning a significantly less risky asset than the US equities benchmark hasn’t been this good in a long time. “Once yields get higher it becomes harder and harder to rationalize valuation levels,” said Mike Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede Trust. “And if earnings growth starts to falter, there can be issues.” Not surprisingly, strategists and portfolio managers predict a bumpy road ahead for stocks. Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson anticipates a tough six months for equities, while Citigroup’s wealth division told clients there’s a buying opportunity in bonds. The path to 5% on the 10-year Treasury became more realistic on Friday after strong jobs data caused economists to reduce expectations for rate cuts this year. But this isn’t just about the Fed. The selloff in bonds is global and based on sticky inflation, hawkish central banks, ballooning government debts, and extreme uncertainties presented by the incoming Trump administration. “When you’re in hostile waters, yields above 5% is where all bets are off,” Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert, said. What equity investors need to know now is if, and when, serious buyers step in. “The real question is where we go from there,” said Rick de los Reyes, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price. “If it’s 5% on its way to 6% then that’s going to get people concerned, if it’s 5% before stabilizing and ultimately going lower then things will be fine.” Red Flags The key isn’t so much that yields are rising, but why, market pros say. A slow increase as the US economy improves can help stocks. But a quick jump due to concerns about inflation, the federal deficit and policy uncertainty is a red flag. In recent years, whenever yields have risen quickly, stocks have sold off. The difference this time appears to be complacent investors, as seen in bullish positioning in the face of frothy valuations and uncertainties about Trump’s policies. And that’s putting equities in a vulnerable position. “When you look at rising prices, a strong job market and an overall strong economy, it all points to a possible uptick in inflation,” said Eric Diton, president of the Wealth Alliance. “And that’s not even including Trump’s policies.” One area that may prove to be a haven for equity investors is the group that’s been driving most of the gains these past few years: Big Tech. The so-called Magnificent Seven companies — Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc. — are still posting rapid earnings growth and massive cash flows. Plus, looking to the future, they’re expected to be the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence revolution. “Investors typically seek high quality stocks with strong balance sheets and strong cash flows during market turmoil,” said Eric Sterner, chief investment officer at Apollon Wealth. “The mega techs have become part of that defensive play recently.” That’s the hope many equity investors are hanging on, that mega-cap tech companies’ sway over the broader market and their relative security will limit any weakness in the stock market. The Magnificent Seven have a more than 30% weighting in the S&P 500. At the same time, the Fed is in the midst of lowering interest rates, although the pace is likely going to be slower than expected. That makes this a very different situation than 2022, when the Fed was hiking rates rapidly and indexes plunged. Still, many Wall Street pros are urging investors to proceed cautiously for the time being as rate risk hits in various unexpected ways. “The companies in the S&P 500 that are up the most will probably be the most vulnerable — and that could include the Mag Seven — and some frothy areas of mid-cap and small-cap growth will likely be under pressure,” said Janus Henderson’s Peron. “We’ve been consistent across our firm on staying focused on quality and being valuation sensitive. That will be very important in the coming months.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek He Built Russia’s Biggest Tech Company.

The U.S. economy shows positive momentum, with robust job growth in last Friday's payrolls report. ... [+] The resilient growth removes almost any chance of another Federal Reserve rate cut soon. The robust and much higher-than-expected employment growth in the December jobs report on Friday essentially wiped out any thoughts of another Federal Reserve rate cut on January 29. Job growth continued to bounce back from the hurricanes and strike-impacted October data. The economy entered 2025 with some momentum, as the Atlanta Fed currently estimates 2.7% GDP growth for the fourth quarter. Employment grew by 256,000 nonfarm jobs, which was well above expectations. Previous data was revised slightly lower, but not enough to diminish the strong report. The household survey data was even more impressive, with a gain of 478,000 jobs, and the research series, which mirrors the payroll report criteria, rose by 102,000. Monthly Job Growth Wage growth was a little below expectations at 3.9% year-over-year, down from 4.0% last month. The average workweek hours were unchanged at 34.3, above the four-year low of 34.2 in January, July, and October. Work Hours & Wage Growth The high-frequency initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits confirm the reversal of the impact of the hurricanes and strike. Initial filings are nearing the lows of 2024. However, continuing claims for benefits are above the lows, indicating some slowdown in people being rehired relative to early 2024. Initial Jobless Claim The unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1% from 4.2%. Before the decline from the August 2024 unemployment rate highs, the rate had risen enough off the lows to signal an impending recession by the Sahm Rule. The Sahm Rule has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession, but there are several reasons to believe that it might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle. Last month, the rate was within a whisker of triggering the Sahm Rule again, but the December unemployment decline moved it away from danger. U.S. Recession Indicator Monitoring the prime-age, 25- to 54-year-old employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The decline in the three-month average of the prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence of some labor market softening. It should be monitored closely, but it does not yet pose an imminent threat to the economy's health, and the monthly reading improved in December. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio: 3 Month Average The ten-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to a 52-week closing high of 4.76% in response to the resilient employment report. At 2.29%, real, after-inflation expectations, 10-year U.S. Treasury yields are now above the average during the 1999 to 2008 period and well above the post-global financial crisis period. 10-Year U.S. Treasury: Nominal & Real Yield Stocks had a down week and erased their year-to-date gains due to higher bond yields and an expectation of fewer Fed rate cuts. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), had a similar move lower. Stock Returns Though the outperformance declined slightly after the jobs report, the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have outperformed defensive stocks, which are less impacted by the economy. This ratio remains elevated, which indicates that investors continue to price a low probability of recession risk in stocks. The more economically sensitive small-capitalization stocks and banks underperformed this week, so some cracks might be forming. Cyclical Versus Defensive Stocks This week, Wednesday’s Consumer Price Index inflation report is a crucial economic report. Consensus estimates expect December CPI to rise to 2.9% year-over-year from 2.7%. The Cleveland Fed’s CPI supports this view and should, combined with the robust jobs report, slam the door shut on any thought of a 0.25% cut at the January 29 meeting. U.S. CPI Inflation Estimate Futures pricing reacted to the strong jobs report by slashing the expectations for total Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025 from two to just one 0.25% cut. Further, no Fed rate reductions are forecasted until at least mid-year. Number Of Expected Rate Cuts While the robust Friday jobs report would seemingly be good news, investors sent stocks lower and bond yields higher. Stocks often agitate for lower rates from the Federal Reserve, as easy money tends to feed speculation. In addition, bond yields have been moving higher, which can weigh on valuations. If higher yields are accompanied by economic growth and better corporate earnings, stocks can shake them off over time. While bond yields might continue to move higher, current yields have begun to look attractive when viewed through the expected after-inflation return. Wednesday’s CPI report could add to the upward pressure on bond yields. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Alphabet (GOOGL) within its recommended investment strategies.

Title: The Inauguration of Trump’s Oligarchy

Time Published: 2025-01-12T11:00:00Z

In modern terms, a Presidential Inauguration is an open-air branding opportunity. John F. Kennedy, a hatless Cold Warrior, placed his Administration at the vanguard of a new generation “born in this century,” and delivered an internationalist vow to “pay any price, bear any burden.” On January 20, 2017, Donald Trump set a distinctly different inaugural tone, delivering a sunless stem-winder of populist fury in which he vowed to heal the hellscape of “American carnage.” No longer would the country bow to self-serving élites and rapacious foreigners: “America will start winning again, winning like never before.” Upon leaving the reviewing stand, George W. Bush was heard to say, “That was some weird shit.” Trump was apoplectic about the coverage of his first hours in office, and he dispatched his spokesman, Sean Spicer, to the White House briefing room to declare that the press had “intentionally framed” images of the crowd to make it seem paltry, when, in fact, Trump had drawn, Spicer huffed incredibly, the “largest audience ever to witness an Inauguration, period.” Spicer then shifted registers to one of unmistakable threat. “And I’m here to tell you that it goes two ways,” he said. “We’re gonna hold the press accountable.” With that, the Era of Trump was truly inaugurated. Joe Biden, whose Presidency is now grinding to its conclusion, had hoped to render Trump’s Administration a historical fluke—a fleeting, if ugly, interregnum. And, as Biden leaves office, he can reasonably argue that jobs are up, inflation is down; violent crime has declined; and, for the first time in a generation, there are no American soldiers engaged in foreign battle. Nevertheless, Biden’s obdurate unwillingness to step aside for younger, more plausible Democratic candidates resulted in the reëmergence of his nemesis. Once more, the music of apocalypse is in the air: “Our Country is a disaster, a laughing stock all over the World!” Trump declared recently. He will return to the Oval Office with a résumé enhanced by two impeachments, one judgment of liability for sexual abuse, and a plump cluster of felony convictions. He will take the oath of office next week at the scene of his gravest transgression, his incitement of an insurrection on Capitol Hill. Still, Trump soldiers on, as if all the legal accusations against him are badges of merit, further proof of his anti-establishment street cred. Since the election, he has proposed so many advisers of low character and dubious qualification that he has overwhelmed the circuitry of the confirmation process and the public sphere. It’s almost as if the early proposition of Matt Gaetz to head the Justice Department were a way to divert attention from the unalloyed awfulness of so many others: Pete Hegseth, Kash Patel, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, Mehmet Oz, and Kristi Noem among them. The dessert for this feast of misbegotten nominations was served when Trump appointed Kimberly Guilfoyle, the longtime fiancée of his eldest son, Don, Jr., as the new Ambassador to Greece—a move that accommodates the son’s fresher affections for a Palm Beach socialite. Across the land, a willing suspension of disbelief has taken hold. (Critical thinking is so 2017.) Certain titans of Silicon Valley, Wall Street, and (God forgive us) the media have hustled off to Mar-a-Lago, a scene of such flagrant self-abnegation, ring-kissing, and genuflection that it would embarrass a medieval Pope. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and the owner of the Washington Post, no longer seems determined to fight the darkness; instead, he kills an endorsement drafted by his editors, watches as some of his most skilled reporters head for the exits, and pays forty million dollars for a documentary on Melania Trump. Mark Zuckerberg’s maga conversion is now so thorough that he has added Trump’s friend Dana White, the C.E.O. of Ultimate Fighting Championship, to the board of Meta. One of Trump’s most effective political maneuvers might be called “whacking the beehive,” a propensity to unleash so much buzzing menace into the air that it’s impossible to maintain calm, much less focus. Will he set up detention camps for undocumented immigrants? Will he split with nato and cut off Ukraine? Are we about to send the 82nd Airborne to descend on the good people of Nuuk? For decades, Vladimir Putin’s greatest rhetorical gambit has been the charge of hypocrisy. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, American critics have rightly described Russia as an oligarchic state. In the nineteen-nineties, a half-dozen or so hustlers emerged from the rubble of the old system to exploit their proximity to Boris Yeltsin and his family to snatch up invaluable state properties––oil fields, mines, television stations––at knockoff prices. Putin came along, in 2000, and eventually deposed most of the first-generation oligarchs, replacing them with his own satraps. He created a personalist system in which all power and all fortunes depended on his good graces. Perhaps what is most striking about the ascendant Trump Administration, which takes pains to cast itself as the champion of a forgotten working class, is its own oligarchic features. The influence of big money in American politics is hardly new. To read Theodore Dreiser’s “The Financier” is to plunge headlong into the muck of Gilded Age deceit. The essential modern text is Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the 2010 Supreme Court decision that equates money with speech, resulting in an ever more corrupt system of campaign finance. Something ominous, if not entirely novel, is taking shape in Washington. When Trump takes the oath of office, on January 20th, Elon Musk, the wealthiest man in the world, will not be far away. Like so many other tech billionaires, Musk apparently thinks of himself as a self-reliant genius-of-the-future, a Nietzschean superman, and yet he well knows that everything from the rise of the Internet to the creation of many newer technologies profits from the support of the state. What’s more, Musk’s influence, unlike that of his Gilded Age predecessors, is amplified by his gargantuan following on a social-media engine in his possession. When Trump steps up to the lectern next week to recite the oath of office, he will stand beside his wife. But he will have a great deal of other company—multibillionaires who have shamelessly dispensed with principle to seek an indulgent new President’s favor and enhance their fortunes. ♦

Title: Index Funds? Nope. We’re Doing This For 8%+ Tech Dividends And Upside
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2025/01/11/index-funds-nope-were-doing-this-for-8-tech-dividends-and-upside/

Investor managing portfolio. Pie chart and candlestick charts. We need to talk about tech stocks. Because, yes, there is a risk of a pullback here. But there’s also a way for us to minimize that risk—and grab 8%+ dividends, plus price upside, as we do so. First off, let me be clear that when I say “tech stocks,” I’m using the NASDAQ 100 as my benchmark. The index is about 60% tech, compared to about a third for the S&P 500. That higher level of tech exposure has allowed the NASDAQ to handily beat the S&P 500 over the long run That outperformance started to slow last year, with the NASDAQ only barely edging out the S&P 500. And as I write this, the NASDAQ’s P/E ratio is 37.2, higher than at any point since the dot-com bubble and well above the S&P 500’s measure of 27.9. Why the stretched valuation? The first thing that comes to mind is AI, which is already driving efficiencies outside the tech sector, such as in manufacturing, law and medicine. Meantime, the existence of open-source models, plus fierce competition between tech firms like Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), OpenAI, Anthropic, Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and others, shows that AI will keep falling in cost, which could slow the continued rise of the large-cap AI stocks. This, by the way, is part of our 2025 AI-investing strategy at CEF Insider: Spread our money across high-yielding closed-end funds (CEFs) that hold big-cap AI names and also invest in companies outside tech that are poised to profit from the technology’s continued growth. Our Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), for example, yields right around 9% now and not only holds firms like Microsoft, Alphabet and NVIDIA (NVDA), but also stocks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), which stands to benefit as AI helps its portfolio managers make better decisions. ADX also holds Visa (V), which is using AI to improve fraud detection, lower costs and boost its margins. Another reason we could see a pullback in the NASDAQ this year is due to the resurgence of cryptocurrency driving unsustainable spending in the tech sector. We saw this in 2021, when surges in Bitcoin prices drove upward momentum on the NASDAQ. Then the bubble popped in 2022, and the NASDAQ slumped in sympathy. With Bitcoin surging again, we could be at the start of another, similar cycle. Consider, for example, the inclusion of MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR) in the NASDAQ 100. The stock is basically a Bitcoin proxy, and while it did surge on the announcement that it would join the index, it plummeted shortly after. To be sure, one risky, unprofitable stock like MicroStrategy taking a tumble isn’t a major issue on its own (except to the people who own it, of course!). But if the stock is part of a broader index, it’s a risk to anyone investing in that index more broadly. This is a big reason why we prefer CEFs for investing in both tech and across the market—our funds’ active managers can navigate around risks like MicroStrategy, while index funds must hold the entire index at all times. Moreover, looking ahead to 2025, if the NASDAQ falls behind the S&P 500 this year, more investors are likely to look for other ways to get tech exposure, beyond a NASDAQ index fund, and actively managed CEFs, with their high dividends, are likely to have a lot of appeal. Speaking of dividends, tech-focused CEFs yield around 8% on average, as I write this. That high cash payout lets you capture profits from tech stocks more easily than you could with a NASDAQ-100 index fund like the Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (QQQ)—current yield 0.5%—where a selloff could erase your “paper gains.” Below we see the market prices of two tech CEFs through 2024: the 8%-yielding BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST), in purple, and the 12%-paying (and private equity–focused) BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), in orange. The benchmark index fund, QQQ, is in blue BST Total Returns Looking at this, you might feel dissatisfied that BST underperformed the NASDAQ 100—could that suggest this CEF isn’t worth buying now? Before jumping to this conclusion, remember that we’re looking at the total return–based market prices here (or the returns based on these funds’ prices on the stock market, including dividends). If we look deeper, at our two CEFs’ total return–based net asset values (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios, including dividends received), we see that BST more or less matched the index (while returning a big slice of its gain in cash, thanks to its high dividend), while BSTZ actually trailed a bit: Total Return on NAV It makes sense that BSTZ is slightly behind when looking at these funds based on their portfolios, rather than their market prices, as this fund holds a large portion of private-equity assets that are still lagging as their recovery takes longer to realize. This chart also suggests BST, which sports an 8% discount to NAV (or the gap between its market price and NAV), is a great buy now. But more crucially, both BST and BSTZ have an advantage over the NASDAQ 100 that is now becoming increasingly valuable: They aren’t directly exposed to crypto. Unlike the NASDAQ 100, neither fund has a position in MSTR, and they don’t invest in other volatile crypto firms, either. So if we see 2025 turn into a repeat of 2022 for cryptocurrencies, BST and BSTZ should fare much better than the index. And even if that doesn’t happen, the risks of a NASDAQ downturn are still likely to have a much lesser impact on these well-managed funds.
