The company's products enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, wearables and in-home devices. The company operates through two segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). FoA includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp and other services. RL includes augmented and virtual reality-related consumer hardware, software and content. Facebook enables people to connect, share, discover and communicate with each other on mobile devices and personal computers. Instagram is a place where people can express themselves through photos, videos and private messaging. Messenger is a messaging application for people to connect with friends, family, groups and businesses across platforms and devices. Stock Market Value: $1.39T ($554.08 per share) Ownership: n/a Average Cost: n/a Activist Commentary: ValueAct has been a premier corporate governance investor for over 20 years. ValueAct principals are generally on the boards of half of ValueAct's core portfolio positions and have had 56 public company board seats over 23 years. ValueAct has previously commenced activist campaigns at 26 information technology companies and has had an average return of 54.63% versus 30.16% for the Russell 2000 over the same period. ValueAct has taken an approximately $1 billion position in Meta Platforms. ValueAct has extensive experience in mega-cap technology companies, most notably Microsoft and Salesforce. ValueAct CEO Mason Morfit was on the board of Microsoft from March 2014 through the end of 2017 as the tech giant transformed into a cloud-based enterprise software business and went from a $250 billion market cap company to more than $3 trillion today. At Salesforce, when a handful of activists were engaging, the company opted to add Morfit to its board on Jan. 27, 2023, and the stock has more than doubled since then. Now, ValueAct has engaged another titan of the market, Meta Platforms, announcing an approximately $1 billion dollar position in the company. Meta's products enable people to connect and share through various platforms and devices, including mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, wearables, and in-home devices. The company operates through two segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). FoA includes social media applications such as Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, while RL includes augmented and virtual reality-related consumer hardware, software and content. This has been an extremely volatile year for Meta's stock price — with dips below $400 per share and highs above $600 — giving ValueAct many opportunities to acquire its position at a favorable price. With the stock price up about 56% in 2024, ValueAct still sees significant untapped value in Meta.Meta is expected to deliver $30 in EPS by 2026, which at a 20-times multiple would put the company at approximately $600 per share. This EPS can be broken down into the company's two segments: $40 EPS from its core FoA segment and -$10 EPS from the RL segment. This would place the valuation of Meta's core FoA business at $800 per share, while its RL segment would be valued at -$200 per share, or a $400 billion drain on the company's valuation. This -$10 EPS from the RL segment is made up of -$7 from the RL division and -$3 from AI spending. ValueAct has shown at Microsoft and Salesforce that it is very good in helping companies trim fat and build muscle. There is certainly some fat in the RL division that can be trimmed. The AI spending, while concerning to some in the market, can be the muscle that strengthens Meta's core FoA business. AI will provide benefits to many companies, but one of its best uses is to create value in consumer internet and matching-based business models that are monetized by connecting their vast audiences to relevant content or services, such as such as Spotify, Indeed.com and Expedia. When AI and GPU computing power are applied to these business models, it can lead to significant improvements in matchmaking and monetization. This is because at the end of the day, AI – even generative AI – is just pattern spotting and pattern recognition, so its application can inherently enhance user-product matching and preference alignment. Meta can be one of the biggest beneficiaries of this market in its core FoA business with respect to delivering content and optimizing advertising. The second lever for AI growth for Meta is the impact of how developers are using large language models (LLMs) to create technologies. Developers are increasingly using multiple LLMs within the same project, so they rely on tools that enable different models to work together. Currently led by OpenAI and Microsoft, companies are competing to control the tools used to layer these LLMs, which are necessary to run and develop new technologies. To enter this market, Mark Zuckerberg has open-sourced Meta's "LLaMA" model, a high-performance AI model designed to compete with OpenAI's GPT and Microsoft's Copilot. The decision to open-source LLaMa has helped build Meta's role in the AI ecosystem by driving LLaMA adoption. It should more than justify Meta's AI spend. So, if Meta continues to bleed the RL division at the same pace and gets absolutely no value from its AI spend, it will have a $600 stock in 2026. However, if ValueAct can do what it has been able to do at Microsoft, Salesforce, Adobe and others – help grow the muscle and trim the fat – RL's -$7 should decline substantially and AI's -$3 will be money well spent and be a significant value creator, as opposed to a drain on value as the market attributes today. Even a neutral valuation ($0 EPS) for RL/AI would place Meta at $800 per share, implying 40% growth from its current price. And if AI prospects become positive, which seems very plausible given these potential avenues of growth, RL/AI should actually contribute to EPS growth. Thus, 40% growth almost becomes a floor that underscores the significant upside for Meta. This is not ValueAct taking a "flyer" on AI. First of all, ValueAct is a very thoughtful and diligent investor and doesn't take "flyers." Second, ValueAct has extensive experience from both sides of AI. The firm has been in the boardroom at companies like Microsoft and Salesforce, two of the largest developers of AI. And the firm has been an active shareholder at companies like Spotify, The New York Times, Expedia and Recruit (Indeed.com) some of the largest users and beneficiaries of AI. So, when ValueAct invests in AI, it isn't just spit balling. The firm thoroughly understands AI and how its customers can use it. When thinking about how ValueAct will approach this engagement going forward, we must address the elephant in the room: Meta is a controlled company, with Mark Zuckerberg holding approximately 61% of the company's voting power. While most activists would never bother with a controlled company for obvious reasons, ValueAct actually has a strong track record of creating value at controlled or quasi-controlled companies, including engagements at Martha Stewart Living, The New York Times, 21st Century Fox, Spotify and KKR. In these situations, ValueAct averaged a return of 124.12% compared to an average of 30.79% for the relevant market benchmark. This is because ValueAct understands that activism is about the power of the idea; the power of the argument; the power of persuasion. As such, even in its investments in non-controlled companies, the firm almost always only takes one board seat because it is confident that its ideas will resonate. However, given Meta's controlled structure, we don't expect ValueAct to push as hard for a board seat here as it might at other portfolio companies. In a controlled company you can almost be as effective as an active shareholder as you can as a director. That being said, given ValueAct's track record of board success, particularly at other mega-cap technology companies, shareholders would be well served if Meta added a ValueAct representative to the board. Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments.

Title: I tested Meta's transparent Ray-Ban smart glasses, and they're a near-perfect accessory for me

If we have made an error or published misleading information, we will correct or clarify the article. If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form. At Meta Connect in September, one of the newest products that caught my eye was a limited-edition pair of Ray-Ban glasses -- with a transparent frame, sapphire transition lenses, and a fairly accessible $429 price tag. Since I've already had great experiences with the Meta Quest 3 and Viture Pro XR glasses, I decided it was time to try the highly praised smart glasses by Meta. Fortunately, I was able to buy a pair right as stock ran out. Only 7,500 units were made available worldwide, and mine is number 4,255, marked on the inside of the right frame and on the charging case. ZDNET's Kerry Wan reviewed the standard Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses last year, and after months of use, he still enjoys their functionality. As announced at Meta Connect, existing Meta glasses will also receive software updates, including natural language processing, the ability to remember and recall key information, live translations, and more. Also: I took my Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses fly fishing, and they beat GoPro in several surprising ways While deciding whether to make the purchase, I intended to use the glasses to capture video that's difficult to record accurately with a camera or smartphone. This includes testing watches, fitness gear, and e-bikes, as well as creating vertical short-form videos for YouTube and Instagram, with both hands-free to interact with devices. I've used action cameras for some of this content before, but I wanted to see if a first-person perspective would result in better footage. Reviewed by ZDNET, the smart glasses can record videos, play Bluetooth audio, and perform useful AI tasks. I also spend time fly fishing, where both hands are occupied, and I want to capture video and still images of these experiences to share with family and friends who don't want to wade through cold rivers and catch small trout. My large, energetic cat demands daily playtime with wand toys, and now I can easily record his incredible acrobatics and funny antics on the go. It's been over two weeks since my Meta Ray-Ban Wayfarer Limited Edition glasses arrived, and they've exceeded my expectations. In addition to capturing great video while running with new watches, testing e-bikes, fishing, and playing with my cat, I've recorded a few fights on the ice at a local minor league hockey game, playful snow leopard kittens at the zoo, and my daily commute as the fall leaves turn under a glowing sunset. You can now capture up to three minutes of video by setting that as the default length, and the audio quality during recording has been much better than I expected. Also: I downloaded Google's Gemini app on the iPhone for free - and it nearly replaces Siri for me Beyond video and still capture, I now prefer using the glasses for calls and podcasts over my AirPods Pro while walking around downtown Seattle. Like the bone conduction headphones I use for running, the Ray-Ban glasses leave my ears open for better awareness of my surroundings, and the sound quality is good for podcasts and music. However, in heavy traffic, the sound can be too quiet, so a future version with bone conduction technology would be ideal. I also appreciate the various messaging options, especially being able to have messages read aloud and easily reply to friends and family. Keeping my phone in my pocket while commuting and wearing the Meta glasses feels like an optimal way to get around. I'm enjoying spending less time looking at screens and more time engaging with the world around me. The transition lenses are a game changer as well. They allow me to wear the glasses both indoors, where I listen to music, make hands-free inquiries with Meta AI, and handle calls and messaging, and outdoors, where I would normally switch to sunglasses. However, I wish the lenses would get a bit darker in full sunlight. Also: In a surprise twist, Meta is suddenly crushing Apple in the innovation battle - Prism The Engo 2 Photochromic glasses have improved my running performance by displaying key health stats, and it would be fantastic to see similar functionality in a future version of the Meta glasses. Even being able to ask Meta for running stats would help me keep my eyes on the road and stay focused on my goals. Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase of this Limited Edition model of the Meta Ray-Bans, which is designed to give me a glimpse into the underlying technology. And I'm even more excited about the added utility that future updates will bring. This article was originally published on October 17, 2024, and was updated on November 16, 2024.

Title: SPLG: This Could Be an Ideal ETF for New Investors

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. New investors just starting out have many choices available to them, and deciding where to begin can be a challenge. Rather than choosing one stock or sector to invest in, investors can instead gain broad exposure to hundreds of the U.S. market’s best stocks through a broad-market S&P 500 ETF like the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF (SPLG). I’m bullish on SPLG due to its strong history of returns and its easy access to the earnings power of over 500 of the U.S.’s best companies in one simple and efficient vehicle. Not only that, it does so for a very low fee, as we’ll discuss in the article. These factors make SPLG a sound choice for all investors. In particular, its instant diversification, extremely low cost, and impressive track record make it an especially appealing choice for new investors looking to make their first investment and to choose an investment to build their portfolios around. According to its issuer, State Street Global Advisors, SPLG is a “low-cost ETF that seeks to offer precise, comprehensive exposure to the US large-cap market segment.” State Street also explains that SPLG is “one of the low-cost core SPDR Portfolio ETFs, a suite of portfolio building blocks designed to provide broad, diversified exposure to core asset classes.” This strategy plays out when you look at SPLG’s holdings. The fund simply invests in the S&P 500 (SPX), which “represents approximately 80% of the US market.” This is a big part of what makes SPLG an ideal building block for investors who are just starting out—rather than picking one company or sector, you are immediately getting broad exposure to the companies that account for about 80% of the U.S. market. This includes many of the best, most profitable, and most innovative companies in the United States (and the world). In fact, SPLG gives investors exposure to semiconductors and artificial intelligence (AI) through Nvidia (NVDA), e-commerce and the cloud through Amazon (AMZN), electric vehicles and renewable power through Tesla (TSLA), and so much more. Below, you’ll find an overview of SPLG’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool. It’s worth noting that these are also some highly rated companies, according to TipRanks’ Smart Score. The Smart Score is TipRanks’ quantitative stock scoring system that gives stocks a score from one to 10, based on eight key market factors. Scores of eight, nine, or 10 are considered equivalent to an Outperform rating. Many of SPLG’s top 10 holdings are rated highly by this system: Amazon and Meta Platforms (META) receive perfect 10 ratings, while Nvidia, Tesla, Alphabet (GOOGL), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) all receive Outperform-equivalent ratings of 8 or higher. Owning these top U.S. stocks has proven to be a winning strategy that has generated strong long-term results for SPLG and its holders. One can’t necessarily say that SPLG has beaten the market because SPLG is the market. Nevertheless, the long-term results have been strong. As of October 31, SPLG has generated an annualized return of 9.1%. Over the past five years, SPLG has posted an annualized return of 15.3%, and over the past 10 years, SPLG has posted an annualized return of 12.9%. Looking at it from a different perspective, an investor who put $10,000 into SPLG five years ago would have $20,990 today, doubling their initial investment in five years. Moreover, an investor putting $10,000 into SPLG a decade ago would have an investment worth $34,490 today, more than tripling their money. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, this is a strong track record and a compelling proposition for new investors just starting out, and therefore makes SPLG an ideal cornerstone for the portfolios of new investors. So what does SPLG charge for this strong performance and broad exposure to over 500 of the top stocks in the U.S.? With an expense ratio of just 0.02%, SPLG is one of the cheapest ETFs you’ll find in today’s market. This 0.02% expense ratio means that an investor in the fund will pay just a negligible $2 in fees for every $10,000 invested on an annual basis. Assuming that the fund returns 5% annually going forward and maintains this expense ratio, this same investor will pay just a minuscule $26 in fees over the course of a decade. It’s hard to beat that kind of savings. Perhaps the best way to put SPLG’s 0.02% expense ratio into perspective is to point out that it is significantly cheaper than many of the other popular broad-market ETFs available to investors. For instance, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), one of the largest ETFs from the low-cost fund giant Vanguard, charges a low 0.03%, but it’s still 50% more expensive than SPLG. Similarly, the iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF also charges 0.03%. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), the largest ETF (and from the same issuer as SPLG), charges 0.09%, which is four and a half times higher than SPLG. Are there any risks to investing in SPLG? Of course, there are, as no investment comes without risk. The immediate risk that comes to mind is that the S&P 500’s valuation is fairly elevated compared to where it has typically traded historically. Right now, the index trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of 25.4 times earnings, above its five-year average of 19.6 times earnings and its 10-year average of 18.1 times earnings (according to data from Factset). While the valuation is relatively high, these are some of America’s strongest companies, and it’s difficult to bet against their earnings growth in the coming years, with the valuation likely adjusting over time. For example, with S&P 500 companies expected to grow earnings next year, the forward price-to-earnings multiple of 22.2 is still slightly above historical levels but appears more reasonable. Plus, new investors can start a position today and build it over time using dollar-cost averaging, where they invest a fixed amount at regular intervals. Alternatively, they can begin with a portion of their capital and add more during periods of market weakness to secure better entry points at a lower valuation. Turning to Wall Street, SPLG earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 401 Buys, 96 Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average SPLG stock price target of $76.61 implies 9.1% upside potential from current levels. In conclusion, I’m bullish on SPLG based on its strong track record of providing great returns to investors for a low fee over the long term. It gives investors broad exposure to over 500 of the top stocks in the U.S. market for an ultra-low expense ratio of just 0.02%, making it a sound cornerstone for new investors to build their portfolios around.

Brands, newsrooms, and other content creators often turn to stock images to bring their projects to life. Despite the robust library of images on marketplaces like Getty Images, sometimes the perfect image just isn't there --and that's where AI can help bring your image to life. This week, Getty Images launched Product Placement and Reference Image features in its Generative AI by Getty Images and Generative AI by iStock offerings, which are commercially safe generative AI tools that transform text prompts into images. Also: Traveling for the holidays? Google Maps uncovers 'hidden gems' to add to your route now With the Product Placement feature, users can input proprietary product images and generate backgrounds that seamlessly blend into the product to create a realistic visualization of what the product would look like in different environments. Ultimately, this feature should help brands streamline their marketing efforts with less work and time involved. Users can now also upload their own reference images, which the tools will then use to create new images, keeping the same qualities as the original photo's color palette and composition, and making it easier for brands to generate content that aligns with their guidelines and style without having to generate new content from scratch. "Our customers are seeking efficiency in their creative process without sacrificing quality or taking on risk. With these new features, we're empowering businesses to create high‑quality, custom visuals at scale," said Grant Farhall, chief product officer of Getty Images. Other companies, including Meta, have unveiled similar marketing tools for advertisers, enabling users to automate tasks such as swapping backdrops for their product images, automatically adjusting creative assets to different aspect ratios, and generating multiple ad text options from an advertiser's original copy. Also: Gemini Live is available to all iOS and Android users now - for free. How to try it To get started with either plan, visit the Getty Images AI offerings page for details on price. The plan starts at $49 per 25 generations, with the biggest advantage being commercially safe image generation that Getty claims comes with "automatic legal protection of up to $50,000 USD per image." Should the self-service options not suffice, custom enterprise solutions are also available. If you are just interested in trying out a commercially safe chatbot with a Structure Reference option, you can try Adobe Firefly; its biggest perk is it's free to use. Beyond that, plenty of image generators are on the market -- see ZDNET's recommendations -- and each one excels in a specific use case.

Title: Big Tech Stocks Suffer $500 Billion Selloff As ‘Dangerously Bullish’ Rally Loses Steam

The Trump-inspired stock market rally dried up further as investors heeded concerns about more hawkish monetary policy, causing a major selloff in big technology stocks as indexes head to a losing week, though equities remain positive since last week’s election. The Trump-induced stock market rally faded further Friday. Stocks fell across the board by mid-Friday afternoon: The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.7%, or 305 points, the S&P 500 declined 1.3% and the tech-concentrated Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.2%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 dipped 1.5%. All four of those indexes posted weekly declines, immediately after all benchmarks other than the Nasdaq posted their best weeks of 2024 amid bullishness tied to Donald Trump winning a second presidential term, with investors encouraged by what corporate tax cuts and looser regulations could mean for profit margins. Indexes are still in the green since Election Day – all four of the aforementioned indexes are up at least 1% since last Tuesday – but it’s a noticeable down stretch across the board. The Nasdaq 100, which tracks 100 of the U.S.’ biggest tech companies, suffered its first five-day losing streak since the first week of January, and information technology was the S&P’s worst performing sector Friday, declining 2.5%, with more than 2% drops from shares of Amazon, Meta and Nvidia leading the charge. $458 billion. That’s how much market capitalization the U.S.’ six most valuable companies—Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta—lost on Friday, according to YCharts data. Both Amazon and Nvidia lost more than $90 billion in market value apiece. The tech selloff came as investors shifted away from the sector viewed as sensitive to higher interest rates, as Federal Reserve officials hinted they may not slash rates further next month, as previously expected. Also slumping Friday were healthcare stocks. The S&P’s healthcare sector dipped 1.9% as Pfizer stock sank 4%. It’s a continuation of the late Thursday afternoon slump after Trump tapped vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. “Trump’s recent unorthodox cabinet picks,” combined with the dollar’s rise to a 12-month high and the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield’s climb from 4.29% to 4.41% following the election, “is causing investors to re-assess the potential impacts of the incoming Republican government,” wrote Sevens Report founder Tom Essaye in a Friday note to clients. The post-election Wall Street reaction is still strongly positive, but Bank of America economists and strategists signaled there’s reason to pump the brakes on the euphoric reaction ahead of Trump, along with a Republican-controlled House and Senate, taking power in January. Investor sentiment and positioning “have grown dangerously bullish,” warns Bank of America’s top equity strategist Savita Subramanian, pointing to technical signals like mutual funds’ percentage of assets held in cash falling to at least a 10-year low and a record high percentage of consumers expecting higher stock prices over the next 12 months. Bank of America economists led by Aditya Bhave told clients Friday risks to their growth forecasts are “unusually large” due to the potential for “sweeping policy changes” under a GOP-controlled oval office and Congress. The cautious Bank of America still has a 6,000 price target for the S&P by year’s end, projecting a 2% rise from Friday’s 5,860 but forecasting an end-of-year price below the record 6,017 set Monday. Wall Street still widely views the stock market implications of the Trump administration as a positive catalyst, and Goldman Sachs strategists said last week the lower corporate tax rates floated by Trump would boost its earnings estimates for S&P companies by 4% annually.

Plus: McDonald’s Stunt Pushed Trump Past Harris On TikTok Good morning, At a storied company like Disney, the streaming era is bringing a windfall. The company said it expects a more than $1 billion profit in its streaming division next fiscal year, as it reported better-than-expected earnings and guidance Thursday. Investors celebrated and shares reached their highest price since early May, ending up 6%. Disney said it expects a $875 million jump in operating profits for its direct-to-consumer entertainment division—which includes its Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ streaming services—for the 12-month period ending next September. Still, the entertainment giant remains more than 40% below its all-time high share price from March 2021, and has lagged behind the broader market and rival Netflix. Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images Tesla’s post-election rally lost steam again Thursday, with its stock entering correction territory as shares of the company led by centibillionaire Elon Musk suffered their second 5% or worse loss in three days. The decline was accelerated by a Reuters report on the Trump transition team reportedly moving to end the $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicle purchasers. Still, Tesla stock is up 23.8% since last Tuesday. President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for attorney general, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, resigned from his House seat Wednesday, but despite making a name for himself in Congress, he hasn’t made an enormous amount of money. It’s doubtful that Gaetz needs much cash, since his father has a fortune of about $35 million, per his Florida disclosures. MORE: The House Committee on Ethics has been investigating Gaetz on allegations including sexual misconduct, illicit drug use and accepting improper gifts, and had been scheduled to vote Friday on whether or not to release its report, according to Punchbowl News. Forbes found five examples in which lawmakers or congressional staff opted to publicly share details about ethics investigations involving members or staffers who had resigned or were on their way out. The U.S. is reportedly investigating Citigroup’s connection to Suleiman Kerimov, a sanctioned Russian billionaire whom American officials say financially benefited from corruption in the Russian government. The Justice Department, the FBI and the IRS are probing the services Citigroup provides for Heritage Trust, which holds assets belonging to Kerimov, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. Alexandre Arnault, son of LVMH CEO and world’s fifth-richest person Bernard Arnault, was named deputy chief executive of the Moët Hennessy brand, positioning him as a contender to succeed his father as head of the luxury goods conglomerate. Arnault is known for his celebrity ties, which he wielded for marketing campaigns during his four-year stint revamping the Tiffany & Co. brand. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison traded off the No. 2 spot on Forbes’ billionaire list Thursday, the latest exchange of the title between the two tech billionaires since September. Ellison’s estimated net worth reached $228.4 billion in the late afternoon, narrowly overtaking Bezos’ net worth of $227.3 billion and placing him behind Tesla chief Elon Musk. General Motors-owned robotaxi and self-driving car company Cruise agreed to pay a $500,000 fine and admitted to submitting a false report after an accident involving one of its vehicles in San Francisco last year. A pedestrian was injured after being struck and dragged approximately 20 feet by a robotaxi, and Cruise eventually suspended its operations last year after multiple safety-related incidents. Photo by Rebecca Noble/Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump selected vaccine skeptic and former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services, tanking shares linked to vaccine developers such as Moderna, Pfizer and Novavax late Thursday. Novavax and BioNTech closed down more than 7%, with almost all of the losses coming after news broke of the selection, while Moderna’s stock closed down 5.6%, bringing the stock to its lowest point of the year. The parent company of the satirical publication The Onion announced Thursday it purchased Alex Jones’ Infowars franchise, which was auctioned off this week to help pay the nearly $1.5 billion Jones owes the families of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre for falsely claiming the school shooting was staged. An attorney representing some Sandy Hook families told Forbes the divestment of Infowars’ assets by The Onion “will meaningfully hinder Jones’ ability to do more harm.” Billionaire Elon Musk, who has been one of Trump’s most prolific supporters and has been acting as an adviser to the president-elect, met with Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations earlier this week, The New York Times reported. Since Trump’s victory, Musk has reportedly taken on a significant role in Cabinet appointments and conversations with other world leaders. Nico Rosberg, who retired from Formula 1 in 2016, is now managing a “fund of funds,” connecting ultra-rich German and Italian families with American venture capital firms. Formula 1 racing legend Nico Rosberg has been rebranding himself as an entrepreneur since claiming his final checkered flag in 2016, and now he’s getting behind the wheel of his most ambitious endeavor yet: managing a fund. In April, his Monaco-based firm Rosberg Ventures announced the creation of a “fund of funds,” which pools capital and deploys it primarily through other VC firms, and Rosberg tells Forbes he has secured $100 million in assets under management. As conversations bubble up about what to keep and cut when it comes to the federal budget, one word that keeps resurfacing is entitlement. An entitlement typically means a benefit that is guaranteed, often by law, like Social Security and Medicare. But entitlement spending is separate from discretionary spending, and the benefits will still be paid if there’s a deficit and even if—as is the case now—Congress has not passed a budget. illustration by yunjia yuan for forbes; photos: Donald Trump by Rebecca Noble/Stringer/Getty Images; Kamala Harris by ANGELA WEISS/Getty Images TOPLINE In the final days of this month’s presidential election, pollsters and pundits insisted that the race was as tight as it could be—statistically tied. But on TikTok, the data told another story: former President Donald Trump had surpassed Vice President Kamala Harris in a dramatic shift of Americans’ online attention. On October 22, then-candidate Trump filmed scenes of himself preparing food at a Philadelphia-area McDonald’s franchise, and on TikTok, official Team Trump accounts flooded viewers’ feeds with the McDonald’s scenes, breaking through to a larger TikTok audience than either candidate had yet seen. Just one of Trump’s McDonald’s videos alone—with more than 63 million views and 7.3 million likes—received more engagement than VP Harris’s top five videos on the platform combined. Today, TikTok has 170 million users in the United States, more than the total number of Americans who voted in the 2020 presidential election. The platform, which is owned and controlled by the Chinese tech giant ByteDance, for years downplayed its role as a place for political discourse in an effort to stem concerns about Chinese government control over the app. But that strategy changed last year, after Congress began seriously considering, and subsequently passed, a bill that would force ByteDance to sell TikTok or see it banned in the United States. If TikTok was going to face a ban, its role as a political platform could help its defense, because political discourse is one of the most protected forms of speech under the First Amendment. During the campaign, Trump, who first tried to ban TikTok in 2020, reversed his position on the app after meeting with Republican megadonor and ByteDance investor Jeffrey Yass earlier this year. In the days following his reelection, Trump’s staff has reiterated that he now hopes to stop the ban bill from taking effect, though repealing or amending the existing law would require an act of Congress. WHY IT MATTERS “This is a reminder of the alarming power that social media companies have over our political discourse,” says Forbes senior writer Emily Baker-White. “TikTok and ByteDance got to decide how many people President-elect Trump and VP Harris’s posts would reach—and they got to watch the effects of that reach in real time. Whether or not TikTok can ultimately avoid a ban, it is worth recognizing the critical role it played in this election, and the role that it and its competitors will likely continue to play in our civic society moving forward.” MORE The Battle Over How Much Politics To Allow On TikTok Bluesky, a text-based social media platform that is a competitor to X, is seeing usage spike as X users flee the Elon Musk-owned platform following President-elect Donald Trump’s victory. Bluesky operates as a “decentralized” social media platform, where users can create their own servers to store data: 1.5 million: The number of new users Bluesky has added over the past week, a company spokesperson told Forbes 14.5 million: The platform’s total users, which pales in comparison to the 250 million people who use X each day, according to a statement from the company in March 2019: The year Bluesky was conceived as a research project by Twitter’s then-CEO and cofounder Jack Dorsey If you’re looking for ways to lower your total tax bill in 2024, don’t wait: Most strategies call for action before the end of the year. For instance, you can max out your 401(k) or other tax-deferred retirement plan with your employer, or make a charitable donation to a donor-advised fund, which is tax-deductible. And if you have a large taxable gain one year, it may be worth considering if you have any losses to reduce the tax impact.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Imagine checking a long-forgotten account and discovering it’s worth multiple millions of dollars. That’s what happened to Sarah, a 50-year-old mom from Seattle, recently. Sarah, who says she’s been homeschooling for 20 years, happened to check her employee benefits account from a tech giant where she used to work. Accredited investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger — and benefit from regular distributions without lifting a finger. Here’s how Car insurance premiums in America are through the roof — and only getting worse. But less than 2 minutes can save you more than $600/year These 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 — and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how The account had gone from barely worth anything to roughly $18 million at current market price, she told Dave Ramsey during a recent episode of The Ramsey Show. Although she didn’t reveal which company it was, some commenters speculated that it could be Nvidia, the tech giant that has surged tremendously over the past two years. Regardless, this sudden multimillionaire says she has “no idea” what to do with her unexpected windfall. Ramsey offered some advice. Having much of your net worth tied up in a single stock is “scary and unwise,” says Ramsey. He recommends offloading some of the shares and investing her money elsewhere. However, given the magnitude of the fortune, selling even a fraction of the account would likely push Sarah into the top tax bracket. He suggests speaking with an expert tax planner or investment adviser to minimize the tax bill. However, he insists on diversifying away from a single stock as soon as possible. “If I’m you, even if it costs me some money I would rather have the safety than I would the extra 20%,” Ramsey told her. According to the Internal Revenue Service, the highest possible capital gains tax rate for someone in the highest tax bracket is 20%, making that the maximum (federal) tax bill Sarah would face. Depending on where you live, you may also face state taxes on your capital gains. For Sarah, in Washington State, that’s another 7%. However, single stocks, particularly in the tech sector, are notoriously volatile. Etsy has lost 34% over the course of 2024, for example, while Facebook’s parent company Meta Platforms lost a whopping 70% of its value in 2022. Read more: Rich, young Americans are ditching the stormy stock market — here are the alternative assets they're banking on instead This is why financial experts recommend diversification, even if one stock has been a big winner. Besides diversification, Sarah’s story offers another lesson for regular investors: the value of longer time horizons. “Time in the market beats timing the market," is a commonly repeated axiom in the financial industry. It’s based on evidence that most investors struggle to find the right stock, at the time, at the right price. Instead, a longer time horizon allows a basket of high-quality investments to compound over time and deliver returns. Legendary investor Warren Buffett once said that timing the market was “both impossible and stupid.” Instead, in a 2015 interview with The Street, he said “the point is to buy something you like at a price you like, and then hold it for 20 years. You should not look at it day to day.” According to the Official Data Foundation, if you invested $10,000 in the S&P 500 in 2004, it would be worth $71,640 by November 2024. That’s not a life-changing fortune, but it does show the power of compound growth over longer time horizons. Most investors could take a page out of Sarah’s book and “buy and forget” high-quality stocks, preferably for several decades.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / NOVEMBER 15 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider.

Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies.

Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play.

Title: TikTok pushes to attract SMBs and its latest advertising tool might just do the trick

Time Published: 2024-11-15T05:01:00Z
Full Content:
In TikTok’s search to attract more SMBs, it’s turning to automation. That journey started off with automating how ads are bought, but now the platform has set its sights on how those ads are created. On Thursday (Nov. 14), TikTok officially launched its Symphony Creative Studio globally, following a beta test period with a select group of advertisers (though how many specifically is unclear). The tool itself sits within the platform’s Symphony AI suite, which launched in May, and also encompasses its AI-powered avatars. These tools are overseen by the Symphony Collective — an advisory board assembled by TikTok brands and creators to discuss challenges of AI in creative marketing, as well as offer feedback on the platform’s tools. Symphony Creative Studio is TikTok’s new AI-powered video generator tool, which enables advertisers to create TikToks in minutes, with minimal input. The product is free to use and only requires a logged-in TikTok for Business account. Sounds too easy, right? Well, that’s the whole point. Michael Fee, global product marketing manager for TikTok Symphony said SMBs have cited not knowing where to start or how to show up on TikTok, as being their biggest pain point, and subsequently biggest barrier to advertising on the platform. Which is why TikTok is using automation to try and remove as much of that friction as possible. “Many of these smaller businesses do not have the resources or knowledge to invest in video production, which is more expensive than other forms of ad creative,” said Matthew Bailey, senior principal analyst, advertising at Omdia. “For this reason, advances in generative AI provide an opportunity to lower the barrier to entry to video advertising — a key concern for TikTok given its role as a social video app.” Call it a win-win: By effectively doing the job for them, marketers get a whole bunch of content without the cost and effort (and quicker), while TikTok wins by getting an endless stream of uploaded content. “We built the tool so whatever your maturity, or your resource availability might look like, you can essentially have that level playing field to work with,” said Adrienne Lahens, TikTok’s global head of content strategy and operations. “Creative Studio helps to really boost productivity because these tools can help you to scale and augment your creative strategies, hyper personalize your content, and free you up as a creative creator, marketer, so you can focus on the more pressing issues.” Creative Studio has three main capabilities. The first is to generate and remix new videos. Advertisers input a URL to their brand’s website, TikTok Shop or Amazon Storefront, or manually upload any business details or brand assets, and within two minutes, the studio conjures up several videos from the input material. The creative studio enables advertisers to easily edit elements of those videos, like the script, the music, the narration, the voice, any effects and transitions. “The creative studio takes into account a lot of the creative best practices in terms of having the right hook, where to place the call to action, layering in music and voiceover, and it also tailors the outputs, based on your product, your vertical to generate that content that’s really relevant to your audience,” said Lahens. “So if you don’t have any content available to you as a brand, you can generate those assets with that function.” A case study Lahens pointed to was U.S. drinkware brand Meoky, which used the studio to create numerous videos using URLs. So far, the brand has achieved a 1.8x increase in purchases and a 13% increase return on ad spend. Though specific figures weren’t shared. The second capability is making variations of existing content to give it a fresh or localized look. For example, videos produced in English can be tweaked using the dubbing and translation tools to reach audiences across the 10 languages that the studio has mastered. Other case studies Lahens highlighted for this feature was U.S. service provider Apartment Life, and German performance marketing agency Voggsmedia, the latter of which is also a TikTok partner. Both saw a 50% improvement in CPAs because they were able to reach wider audiences, by translating their videos in these instances to Spanish. Creative Studio’s third feature is automatically generating new TikToks for you every 24 hours, taking into account some of the latest trends of the top performing ads. “The goal we set out is we want our advertisers to never run out of content when using the creative studio,” said Lahens. Once the content is creative, advertisers can either post it on the platform for a campaign, or upload it to TikTok’s AI black box tool, Smart+ and let the tool distribute it for them. It’s a notable leap of faith in AI, but according to Lahens, control hasn’t been an issue so far. In fact, using the tool has given advertisers a lot of peace of mind, because all of the content that is output from the creative studio is only based on either the assets that they’re inputting into the system, she said. And there’s no worry about copyright issues because the studio has a wealth of approved stock images, videos, thanks to TikTok’s partnerships with Billo and Getty Images, along with digital avatars and commercial music which is royalty free. Looking ahead, marketers will gain even more flexibility. They’ll be able to tweak existing videos by switching out elements like music of the opening hook while keeping everything else intact. Having tools like this is another way for TikTok to try to reassure smaller advertisers, who already manage Google and Meta spend and have limited marketing teams, that they can multi-home on TikTok without paying an enormous price in time or effort, explained Jamie MacEwan, senior research analyst at Enders Analysis. “It’s really important given how much Reels and Shorts have grown, and the fact that Meta and Google are continually improving their tools that convert creative across a range of formats, including short-form video,” he added. “These advertisers tend to focus more on immediate ROI, so the hope will be that reducing upfront costs can give them more leeway on their bids for clicks and impressions.” Done right, curation is a win-win: more efficient reach for advertisers and a revenue bump for publishers. Agency strategists and cultural experts told Digiday they expect some marketers to turn towards more “conservative” messaging. With backing from Campbell’s, Rao’s is spending more to show up in live sports and events with the hope of reaching a national audience.

This approach facilitates search engines’ understanding of your site. It also assists people in remembering and sharing your links. Maintain a shallow URL depth. Aim for no more than three levels in your structure. Use categories and subcategories judiciously. Avoid lengthy strings of numbers or random characters. Opt for lowercase letters and hyphens rather than underscores. These minor adjustments can improve your SEO and enhance your site’s user-friendliness. Utilising faceted navigation for product categories Faceted navigation helps shoppers find products fast. It lets them filter items by size, colour, price, and more. This system works great for stores with lots of products. It makes browsing easy and fun for customers. Shopify offers built-in faceted navigation tools.

This cuts down on duplicate content issues. It’s a smart move for any Shopify store owner. Make sure to add them to your SEO checklist. Your store will thank you with better visibility online.

Title: Supreme Court seems likely to allow class action to proceed against tech company Nvidia

The Supreme Court seems likely to keep alive a class-action lawsuit accusing Nvidia of misleading investors about its dependence on selling computer chips for the mining of volatile cryptocurrency WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Wednesday seemed likely to keep alive a class-action lawsuit accusing Nvidia of misleading investors about its dependence on selling computer chips for the mining of volatile cryptocurrency. The justices heard arguments in the tech company's appeal of a lower-court ruling allowing a 2018 suit led by a Swedish investment management firm to continue. It’s one of two high court cases involving class-action lawsuits against tech companies. Last week, the justices wrestled with whether to shut down a multibillion-dollar class action investors’ lawsuit against Facebook parent Meta stemming from the privacy scandal involving the Cambridge Analytica political consulting firm. On Wednesday, a majority of the court that included liberal and conservative justices appeared to reject the arguments advanced by Neal Katyal, the lawyer for Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia. “It’s less and less clear why we took this case and why you should win it,” Justice Elena Kagan said. The lawsuit followed a dip in the profitability of cryptocurrency, which caused Nvidia's revenues to fall short of projections and led to a 28% drop in the company's stock price. In 2022, Nvidia paid a $5.5 million fine to settle charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it failed to disclose that cryptomining was a significant source of revenue growth from the sale of graphics processing units that were produced and marketed for gaming. The company did not admit to any wrongdoing as part of the settlement. Nvidia has led the artificial intelligence sector to become one of the stock market’s biggest companies, as tech giants continue to spend heavily on the company’s chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems. That chipmaking dominance has cemented Nvidia’s place as the poster child of the artificial intelligence boom -- what CEO Jensen Huang has dubbed “the next industrial revolution.” Demand for generative AI products that can compose documents, make images and serve as personal assistants has fueled sales of Nvidia’s specialized chips over the last year. Nvidia is among the most valuable companies in the S&P 500, worth over $3 trillion. The company is set to report its third quarter earnings next week. In the Supreme Court case, the company is arguing that the investors' lawsuit should be thrown out because it does not measure up to a 1995 law, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, that is intended to bar frivolous complaints. A district court judge had dismissed the complaint before the federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that it could go forward. The Biden administration is backing the investors. A decision is expected by early summer. ___ Associated Press writer Sarah Parvini in Los Angeles contributed to this report 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Nvidia has led the artificial intelligence sector to become one of the stock market’s biggest companies, as tech giants continue to spend heavily on the company’s chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems. That chipmaking dominance has cemented Nvidia’s place as the poster child of the artificial intelligence boom -- what CEO Jensen Huang has dubbed “the next industrial revolution.” Demand for generative AI products that can compose documents, make images and serve as personal assistants has fueled sales of Nvidia’s specialized chips over the last year. Nvidia is among the most valuable companies in the S&P 500, worth over $3 trillion. The company is set to report its third quarter earnings next week. In the Supreme Court case, the company is arguing that the investors' lawsuit should be thrown out because it does not measure up to a 1995 law, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, that is intended to bar frivolous complaints. A district court judge had dismissed the complaint before the federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that it could go forward. The Biden administration is backing the investors. A decision is expected by early summer. ___ Associated Press writer Sarah Parvini in Los Angeles contributed to this report 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Nearly two years later, the DualSense Edge refuses to drop by more than $10 for Black Friday

$10 isn't a lot, but maybe it'll help you afford this premium gamepad When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Since it launched in January of 2023, I've been watching the price of the DualSense Edge like a hawk. I love that controller for loads of reasons, but there's no getting around the fact that it's simply too expensive compared to the other PS5 Pro controllers out there. Suffice it to say, I've been left disappointed every month as the Edge has held onto its $199 price tag like its life depends on it. The only ever discount I've seen has come during Days of Play, and perhaps a few sporadic deals throughout the last year, when it's dropped by a measly $10. But Black Friday approacheth, and with PS5 Pros now in the wild, that price has returned to greet us. In an early Walmart deal that might point to what we'll see at other retailers in the coming weeks, the DualSense Edge has sarcastically slumped down to $189. I know, I know, it's hardly a discount worthy of two years on the market, but it's something. For reference, this only makes it $120 more than the stock PS5 controller, as opposed to its usual $130 discrepancy. On the other hand, if you're not so fussed about Sony's homegrown pro controller, there are other Black Friday PS5 deals with much more honest discounts. The Nacon Revolution 5 pro, which shares the Edge's $199 MSRP has slid down to $149.99 at Amazon. That may be more appealing since it actually has more pro utility than the DualSense Edge. DualSense Edge | $199 $189.99 at WalmartSave $10 - A small discount makes this stubbornly expensive PS5 controller a bit more affordable. I'd love to tell you it was a bigger saving, but sometimes a smaller discount is all we can ask for if a product never leaves its MSRP. Buy it if: ✅ You want a premium version of the DualSense✅ You'd like a PS5 pro controller with haptic feedback and trigger resistance✅ You'd only use two back paddles Don't buy it if: ❌ You want more attachments and back buttons❌ You want zero chance of stick drift Price check: $199 at Amazon UK: £195 at Amazon The DualSense Edge is a great PS5 controller, but it might not be the right one for you, depending on what games you play. If you're someone who wants a gamepad that lets you compete with mouse and keyboard players, or if you want the most utility available, then you might be better off with one of the other best PS5 controllers. The Nacon Revolution 5 Pro mentioned above, as well as the Victrix Pro BFG, both have four back buttons to the DualSense Edge's two, and they're both more affordable right now. However, if you mainly play single-player games, or you only really have interest in two back paddles, the DualSense Edge will likely give you more. Sony makes it so that for other controllers to secure official licensing on PS5, they have to leave out any rumble or haptic feedback features, so the DualSense Edge is the only pro controller on PS5 that can give you that sweet haptic feedback kick. You may think that adds value to the Edge, but there is the longevity argument to talk about. The Nacon R5P has Hall Sensor sticks, making it immune to stick drift. The DualSense Edge has potentiometer sticks that will wear down over time, and even if its thumbstick modules can be removed and replaced, it's very tricky to get hold of replacements sometimes. With a reputation from the DualSense for stick drift being a common plague, that doesn't inspire a lot of confidence. If it helps, I've been using mine since launch, and it hasn't broken down in the same way as my stock PS5 controllers. More discounts are coming, check out Black Friday gaming PC deals, Black Friday Meta Quest deals, and Black Friday Secretlab deals. Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more One of my earliest memories is playing SuperMario64 and wondering why the controller I held had three grips, but I only had two hands. Ever since I've been in love with video games and their technology. After graduating from Edinburgh Napier University with a degree in Journalism, I contributed to the Scottish Games Network and completed an Editorial Internship at Expert Reviews. Over the last decade, I’ve been managing my own YouTube channel about my love of games too. These days, I'm one of the resident hardware nerds at GamesRadar+, and I take the lead on our coverage of gaming PCs, VR, controllers, gaming chairs, and content creation gear. Now, I better stop myself here before I get talking about my favourite games like HUNT: Showdown, Dishonored, and Towerfall Ascension. Location: UK Remote I don't think the Backbone One is worth $100, but I can recommend its early Black Friday price You can pre-order the latest Steam controller now, but I'm not sure you should Solo city builder dev says indie developers' efforts need to count: "You can't polish up that turd, you need to let go and move on" GamesRadar+ is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Title: How Weird Fish ditched discounts, refreshed its image and won over younger consumers

Advertisement November 13, 2024 | 10 min read Listen to article 4 min Winning the Gold award at The Drum Awards for Media 2024 in the Performance category is Launch for Weird Fish, with a robust performance strategy that helped bolster brand reputation and drive sales. Here is the award-winning case study. Weird Fish renewed its image while attracting younger customers with a refreshed performance strategy / Weird Fish This was, of course, no easy task during a cost of living crisis, with bargain prices a top consumer priority. The challenge was compounded by crowded e-commerce market conditions in which increasing numbers of online fashion retailers are competing for consumers' limited disposable income. In particular, the brand hoped to achieve a 30% increase in the clickthrough rate on non-sales-focused ads across paid search and paid social. As part of its objective to boost brand awareness, Weird Fish also wanted to lift impressions for specific Google Search keywords by 15% year-over-year (YoY) and grow average order value for Google and Bing ads by 6%. On Meta, the brand aimed to increase average order value via ads by 15% while also boosting YoY return on ad spend on Meta by 7%. A crucial element of this campaign’s success was engaging new audiences beyond Weird Fish’s traditional demographic of sales-focused consumers aged 35 and older. So, in addition to shifting brand perceptions among the existing customer base, the agency targeted a younger 25-35-year-old demographic, new to Weird Fish, who had no discount expectations. The core of this strategy focused on driving stock movement through seasonality and industry trends rather than relying on price reductions. Achieving this shift required a concerted effort across several key areas. First, building strong agency-client relationships was essential, with regular check-ins and open communication channels enabling agile responses to consumer trends beyond mere sales data. This approach ensured a readiness to adapt strategy and budget as needed, such as when demand surged for particular product lines. Another priority was audience experimentation, leveraging advanced tools like Meta’s AI-driven Advantage+, Bloomreach for personalization, and Google’s Demand Gen to define key audiences, understand their behavior and target audiences more effectively. Optimizing shopping listings also played a crucial role, employing Weird Fish’s oft-underutilized creative assets to improve ad rankings within feeds, placing them above competitors. Finally, a creative overhaul in paid social ads further enriched the brand image, strengthening its impact across platforms. Advertisement The first step in campaign execution was implementation. Central to success was the adoption of ‘The Launch Way’, an approach to client relations in which Launch establishes itself as an extension of the Weird Fish team. Regular in-person visits to their offices built personal rapport, allowed brand immersion and led to open, honest and challenging discussions. With a solid agency-client foundation established, close consultation before each season helped the team dig deep into key products and volumes. Weird Fish gave the Launch team the freedom to make autonomous decisions to push higher-margin products at key audiences when opportunities arose. For example, Launch worked with their brand buyer to test the performance of the new ‘Kerina Maxi Dress’ in paid social ads. Our hip creative featured younger models, targeted at the new, younger audiences at a non-discounted price. The dress consistently sold out and set the scene for a continuous loop where Weird Fish’s business goals fed into – and drew insight from – our campaign approach. The next step in the execution was audience experimentation. New audience reach was crucial to breaking free from discounting. Launch harnessed the latest AI tools to effectively target audiences across search and social. Google’s Demand Gen was an emerging technology when Launch first started working with the brand. But the team adopted it early, before peak season around Black Friday and Christmas, to get ahead of competitors. Combining a strong audience strategy with creative best practice, our innovative approach impressed Google, with the company’s senior account strategist Stephen Nother stating: “This activity not only delivered a significant number of incremental conversions, but also helped drive an uplift in searches year-over-year for Weird Fish which, if continued, will have positive long-term effects across search and Performance Max activity.” Launch tested and tweaked target audiences within Performance Max to reach the right customers. The team also harnessed insights from audiences in other campaign types across Google and Meta to inform approaches to reaching both existing customers and new prospects. This innovation across Google platforms was bolstered by Bloomreach, which Weird Fish uses to track consumer activity. It gave Launch access to real-time sales and audience data, enabling it to combine a seasonal approach with a reactive one, releasing budget across both paid search and social on exceptional days to move ‘in-demand’, higher value products. On paid social, Launch mastered Meta’s Advantage+, testing it with a variety of audiences to identify those that would convert to high-value sales. For example, an audience that had never purchased or been to the website was targeted with creatives in a modern, funky style – and crucially, without discounts. To increase the clickthrough rate and add polish to the brand, Launch overhauled the brand’s Google shopping listings, swapping images from basic flat lays to more visually appealing lifestyle images. Advertisement Launch enhanced Weird Fish’s shopping feed with management software Shoptimised, testing product titles that resonated best with potential customers and listing all back-end product attributes correctly. Meanwhile, much of the brand repositioning work took place across paid social channels, where Launch and Weird Fish focused on brand image enrichment, showcasing lifestyle appeal over discount pricing. Slowly axing discounts across social ads, Launch cushioned the impact by switching to more engaging visuals, like border use on Dynamic Product Ads. In years past, video had been overlooked as a brand-building tool on social for Weird Fish. The retailer had, however, staged some beautiful video shoots, so Launch put those assets to work in brand awareness campaigns across social channels.

The goal was to drive sales of higher-value products and increase conversion rates during a challenging 2023 market slump. UK e-commerce revenue was down 3% YoY and a cost of living crisis had tempered consumer spending. The campaign met or surpassed all objectives. The brand saw a 54% lift in clickthrough rates on Google and Bing ads, nearly doubling the benchmark goal. Meanwhile, on Meta, the brand achieved a 34% lift in clickthrough rate. The brand also grew return on ad spend by 8.6% on Meta, surpassing a 7% growth objective. Between December 2023 and May 2024, impressions for the term ‘Weird Fish’ increased by 24% YoY, besting the campaign target by nearly 10%. Furthermore, by refining creative assets and distribution on paid social, the clickthrough rate more than doubled in the first month, thanks to a more tailored approach. Advantage+ campaigns targeted at those who had not previously made a purchase at Weird Fish returned a £2 higher return on ad spend than others that ran with discounts. Borders added to Dynamic Product Ads dramatically improved sales and clickthrough rates on some ads by up to 220%. Plus, brand awareness campaigns featuring video assets achieved a 15-second watch time for only £0.01. Finally, the average order value for Google and Bing ads jumped by 15% overall, beating the campaign objective by 9%. On Meta, the average order value grew 15%, meeting the objective.

Title: Warren Buffett Breaks 6-Year Streak Of Berkshire Hathaway Stock Buybacks, Say 'It's Too Expensive'
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-breaks-6-streak-155338238.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett recently ended a six-year streak of stock buybacks for the company. While the company regularly participates in stock buybacks, it did not do so during the third quarter, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Despite having over $325 billion in cash reserves, Buffett opted not to use that cash to buy back shares, suggesting that he believes the stock is too expensive. Don't Miss: This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's a limited time opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share before closing date. The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market. Buffett's approach to stock buybacks is straightforward: he only buys back shares when he considers them a "bargain." According to Berkshire Hathaway's regulatory filings, he looks for a stock price below the company's intrinsic value – a conservative measure considering the long-term worth of Berkshire's assets. Analysts believe the absence of buybacks sends a clear message to the market: Berkshire's stock is overvalued at its current price. Berkshire Hathaway's Class A shares are trading around 1.6 times their book value, representing the company's assets once debts are subtracted. In the past, Berkshire has avoided buybacks when the stock traded above 1.2 times its book value, but that guideline was dropped in 2018. Trending: Warren Buffett once said, "If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die." These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever. Buffett's conservative investment philosophy remains firm even with a more flexible policy. Robert Korajczyk, a finance professor at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management, explained to CNN, "He's been very clear that they would never buy back shares if they thought that the firm was overvalued." In addition to ending its buyback streak, Berkshire increased its already significant cash holdings by selling stocks in the third quarter. Some analysts took this as a cautionary move due to concerns about the current market environment. Trending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today. NYU Stern School of Business professor Aswath Damodaran told CNN that Buffett's decision to hold cash suggests Berkshire is taking a conservative stance, likely due to high stock prices. "It's a signal that they feel cautious about where the market is," Damodaran said. "They've become cautious because they think the market is richly priced." Buffett frequently emphasizes patience and caution in investing, especially in overheated markets. Known for his simple advice, Buffett has reminded investors of the importance of waiting for opportunities that align with their long-term goals. One of his well-known principles is to "be fearful when others are greedy and greedy only when others are fearful." This approach aligns with his decision not to pursue buybacks when Berkshire's stock is performing well but appears expensive. See Also: With over 7.8K investors including Meta, Google, And Amazon Execs — this AI Startup's valuation has skyrocketed from $5 million to $85 million in just three years. Be an early investor with just $1,000 for only $0.50/share today before the offer closes in 2 weeks. For investors following Buffett's lead, his recent actions underline the importance of valuation and the benefit of holding cash when the market feels overvalued. Buffett's strategies, which often prioritize value and conservative growth, can provide insights for those looking to make calculated, patient investments that align with their financial goals. Consider talking to a trusted financial advisor if you're looking for guidance tailored to your unique circumstances. They can help you map out a plan toward your long-term goals.

The Swedish payments company has yet to publicly file its IPO prospectus. The company said the offering would follow the SEC's review process and is subject to market conditions. Analysts recently valued Klarna, which was founded in 2005, in the $15 billion range. At its peak during the pandemic-led surge in fintech stocks and e-commerce, the company had a valuation of $46 billion in a funding round led by SoftBank's Vision Fund 2. But Klarna took an 85% haircut in its most recent primary fundraising round, in 2022, when the company raised money on a valuation of $6.7 billion. In addition to SoftBank, Klarna's roster of shareholders includes Sequoia Capital and London-based firm Atomico. Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski previously told CNBC in an interview that unfavorable rules in Europe on employee stock options could risk the company losing talent to U.S. tech giants such as Google, Apple and Meta. Plans for an IPO have been in the works for some time. In a February interview with CNBC's "Closing Bell," Siemiatkowski said an IPO in 2024 was "not impossible." Affirm, one of the company's key competitors, went public in 2021 and is now valued at about $18 billion. In August, Klarna said it swung to a profit in the first half of the year. Klarna's decision to go pursue a listing in the U.S. represents a major blow to European stock exchanges, which have been trying to encourage local tech companies to list at home. The London Stock Exchange, for example, has made reforms to make the U.K. a more attractive market for tech companies to list, including the ability for founders to issue dual-class shares that enable entrepreneurs to maintain control over a company's strategy and direction. Siemiatkowski hadn't previously committed to listing in one market over another, and London was among the markets he was considering for Klarna's IPO. However, in 2021 he said that the firm was more likely to list in the U.S. than the U.K., due in part to higher visibility. Navina Rajan, an analyst at PitchBook, said it's an ongoing trend. "We've seen the share of European companies listing on European exchanges has continued to decline from the 10-year low since last year and the valuation gap between both geographies for tech companies remains," Rajan told CNBC in an email. "European IPO markets have seen some recovery as of Q3 this year," she added. Listing in the U.S. lines up with Klarna's focus on U.S. expansion, Rajan said.

Title: The AI Tipping Point: Half of CFOs will axe AI investment if it doesn't show ROI next year

While this signals growing confidence in AI, it's accompanied by a strict demand for accountability. Half of CFOs (50%) report they will axe AI investment if it fails to deliver measurable ROI within a year, highlighting a narrow window for proving its impact. The findings were revealed in accounts payable automation Basware's AI to ROI Report, conducted by independent research firm Financial Times Longitude. The study surveyed 400 global CFOs and finance leaders on their attitude, priorities and challenges when it comes to AI in the finance department. Infographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2555171/Basware_1.jpg Uncertainty is Restricting Investment The biggest priority for financial leaders when implementing finance transformation projects is cost efficiency, with one-third (32%) listing it as their primary focus. However, any financial confidence will remain rocky with macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties continuing to swirl up until the end of the year, and beyond. This uncertainty is directly impacting AI adoption within finance functions, making it challenging for 41% of finance leaders to prioritize AI investment. No one is exempt from the fallout of uncertainty. Even Meta's latest earnings saw a reduced stock-price revision worth $5.1bn to reflect concerns over the company's capacity to mobilize AI investments and sustain growth. Meta has invested in a "significant acceleration" in AI-related infrastructure, but analysts warn that they need to prove they can continue to cover its rising AI costs and deliver ROI. For companies like Meta, a bounce-back is likely, but recoverability in the short-term isn't achievable for all. Unclear AI Strategy According to the report, finance leaders want to invest more in AI to reduce manual tasks and allow their teams to focus on priorities in their business. 70% of finance leaders said that staff want AI support for administrative tasks, while 75% report that AI has enabled their workforce to focus on more strategic activities such as e-invoicing compliance. However, the biggest barrier to finance transformation is change management and an unclear AI strategy. 40% of finance leaders state that their organization lacks change management capabilities, while 31% highlight a lack of clear strategic vision for the future of the finance function. Infographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2555172/Basware_2.jpg These factors hinder ROI for AI projects, resulting in question marks over investment without tangible financial benefits. Perttu Nihti, Chief Product Officer at Basware, commented on the new AI study:"The office of the CFO is tasked with overseeing a complex range of functions from regulatory compliance through to cash flow management and financial reporting. All of which are areas where AI-powered automation can help to reduce hours and relieve pressure. But the success of AI investment hangs on knowing where to start and proving impact. We're at the AI tipping point. Focusing on high-value wins, such as AI-powered efficiency that demonstrate quantifiable ROI quickly, in areas such as compliance, error reduction and fraud detection, will help justify investment across a company's organization." Turning Investment into Results Accounts Payable is one such starting point that is already returning greater levels of ROI. The survey revealed that organizations prioritizing AI investment are realizing a return of 136% ROI, with savings exceeding $1.36 for every $1m invested over the duration of three years. Among CFOs prioritizing AI innovation and applying it to processes in accounts payable, reducing errors, faster fraud detection, reduced operational costs and improved regulatory compliance were found to be the greatest benefits. How One Global Company Realized AI's ROI One example of how AI has driven ROI for an enterprise is paper and packaging manufacturer Billerud. The accounts payable team was previously hindered by time-consuming manual invoice processing, which cost them several hours each day. To address this inefficiency, they implemented Basware's SmartPDF AI Instant Learning solution, which uses AI and text extraction to convert PDF invoices into authentic e-invoices. Billerud has seen a substantial reduction of invoices needing validation, dropping from 15% to 9% due to AI Instant Learning, and saving AP staff several hours each day. Now, powered by AI, over 90% of their invoices are validated automatically due to faster, more accurate data extraction. Jesper Persson, Business Developer at Billerud, said:"Since day one, we've perceived the desired values from the project. The quality of invoices has improved considerably, and the AI continues to evolve and improve with each passing day. The efficiency gains we achieved translated directly into tangible cost savings, paving the way for a rapid return on investment within just a few months." The findings reveal a tipping point for AI in finance. While 50% of CFOs may cut AI investments without clear ROI, those that identify specific starting points for AI implementation - such as invoice processing automation - can achieve measurable returns within months rather than years. These successes are creating a blueprint for broader AI adoption across finance functions.

Title: Bluesky Pulled a Million New Users After Election as More Abandoned Musk’s X

By Miles Klee The reelection of Donald Trump as president last week brought a wave of jubilation to X (formerly Twitter). The influencers and megadonors who supported the Republican nominee delighted in the defeat of his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, while giddily speculating about the extremist agenda he would pursue once in office. The site’s owner, billionaire Trump ally Elon Musk, who had drastically overhauled the platform to amplify far-right misinformation and hate speech, was particularly pleased. He announced in a post on Monday that the Super PAC through which he committed at least $119 million of his personal wealth to electing Trump would keep working to register more Republican voters in “key districts around the country.” For many who had hoped to see Trump lose, and were already on the fence about leaving X, this victory lap provided as good an occasion as any to finally log off. Many users noted a steady loss of hundreds or even thousands of followers as accounts were deactivated, continuing a downward trend in activity since Musk’s takeover of the social network in late 2022. Meanwhile, its direct competitors — Bluesky and Threads — once again saw an influx of new users apparently fleeing the toxic conversation on X. Bluesky, a decentralized service developed as a project under former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and then incorporated as a separate company, announced on Tuesday that in the week since the election it had added 1 million users, bringing it close to 15 million registered users altogether. It opened to the public in February after previously being invite-only. With a more left-leaning sensibility and a focus on transparency and user safety, it is favored by those increasingly alienated by the politics of Musk and X, or vulnerable to harassment there. (Marginalized groups including transgender and disabled people are well represented on the platform.) Threads, a Twitter-like app by Meta that is linked to a user’s Instagram account, has not disclosed a post-election spike in sign-ups. But on Monday, the network’s official account posted an update welcoming newcomers and sharing tips for how to optimize the service. With Meta’s established user base, it expanded quickly after launching in July 2023, and the weekend before the election, the company said Threads had reached 275 million monthly active users. CEO Mark Zuckerberg also revealed that a million people sign up for the service every day. “We’ve been pleased to see Threads’ steady growth since it launched last year,” a Meta spokesperson tells Rolling Stone. Editor’s picks The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time In contrast to Bluesky, which shows users posts from people they follow in chronological order and offers specialized feeds including a “Discover” section, Threads is more aggressively algorithmic, showing posts non-chronologically and inserting recommended content into your main feed. (X’s “For You” feed is similar, though on that site users can opt to scroll a feed of content only from accounts you’re following.) It hosts more mainstream brands, news outlets, celebrities, and pundits, but it also doesn’t recommend political content unless a user explicitly asks for it. Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, it feels more like Facebook than Bluesky, where an anarchic “shitposting” culture tends to dominate, and famous faces are not always welcome. “Bluesky Social” became a trending topic on Threads on Tuesday as users reacted to the news of its rapid growth. Preferences between the two platforms differ, such that both have lately seen an uptick in discussion about the pros and cons of each. This in itself was another indication that people who once relied on X to stay informed and connected are thinking about their best alternatives in the fragmenting landscape of social media. Meanwhile, X’s future as it continues to lose liberal and moderate voices, leaving MAGA diehards to revel in a second Trump term, is murky at best. In becoming a political bullhorn for the right, it now more closely resembles Truth Social, the app Trump rolled out in 2022 after he was permanently suspended from Twitter. (Musk later reinstated his account.) With its distinct focus on Trump himself, Truth Social has struggled to attract a user base, though in an interview the morning following the election, tech journalist Kara Swisher speculated that X and Truth Social — both failing businesses but useful when it comes to propagandizing — could merge into one company, with Musk and Trump profiting off it as a so-called “meme stock,” one whose price is driven up through viral hype among retail investors.

Some want meaningful connections. Others only want to hear opinions they agree with. And a few might just get off their phones altogether.
