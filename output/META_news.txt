We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) surged as much as 25% before paring gains in after-hours trading on Tuesday as investors brace for more wild swings with Donald Trump edging ahead of Kamala Harris in the latest election results. All states have now closed their respective polling stations. So far, Trump has secured 248 electoral college votes, while Harris has claimed 214, according to the Associated Press. The stock had a wild session during market hours on Tuesday as trading was halted several times due to volatility, with shares quickly erasing 15% gains and reversing Monday's double-digit percentage rise to kick off the week. Despite a recovery from steeper losses, shares still closed down a little over 1%. The latest price action comes as investors await the results of the presidential election between the Republican nominee and his challenger. Volatility in the stock is expected to continue as strategists categorize the stock as a binary bet on the election. Matthew Tuttle, CEO of investment fund Tuttle Capital Management, recently told Yahoo Finance's Catalysts that the trajectory of shares hinges on "a buy the rumor, sell the fact" trading strategy.

"If he loses, I think it goes to zero." Interactive Brokers' chief strategist Steve Sosnick said DJT has taken on a meme-stock "life of its own." "It was volatile on the way up, and when a stock is that volatile in one direction, it has a tendency to be that volatile in the other direction," he said on a call with Yahoo Finance last week. In September, shares in the company — the home of the Republican nominee's social media platform, Truth Social — traded at its lowest level since the company's debut following the expiration of its highly publicized lockup period. Shares had bounced back from their lows, though, as both domestic and overseas betting markets shifted in favor of a Trump victory. Trump founded Truth Social after he was kicked off major social media apps like Facebook (META) and Twitter, now X, following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots. Trump has since been reinstated on those platforms. He officially returned to posting on X in mid-August after about a year's hiatus. As Truth Social attempts to take on social media incumbents, the fundamentals of the company have long been in question. On Tuesday, DJT dropped third quarter results after the market close that revealed a net loss of $19.25 million for the quarter ending Sept. 30. This was narrower than the $26.03 million the company reported in the year-ago period. DJT also reported revenue of $1.01 million, a slight year-over-year drop compared to the $1.07 million it reported in the third quarter of 2023. Over the past nine months ending Sept. 30, revenue has fallen 23% from the prior-year period. Last month, the company revealed that its COO had stepped down in September. Trump maintains a roughly 60% interest in DJT, making his share worth billions. Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Title: Should You Pick META Stock At $560?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/11/05/should-you-pick-meta-stock-at-560/

AUSTIN, TEXAS - SEPTEMBER 18: In this photo illustration, the Instagram logo is displayed on a ... [+] computer screen on September 18, 2024 in Austin, Texas. (Photo illustration by Brandon Bell/Getty Images) Meta stock (NASDAQ: META) has seen a 3% fall in a week, while it’s up around 60% this year. The company recently reported its Q3 results, which were better than the street estimates. Its top line stood at $40.6 billion and the bottom line at $6.03, compared to the consensus estimates of $40.2 billion and $5.25, respectively. Despite a beat, the stock didn’t see any gains, as investors were concerned about higher costs. Let’s dive deeper into the company’s quarterly performance and its impact on META stock. Also, look at what’s happening with Google stock. Meta Platforms’ revenues of $40.6 billion in Q3 reflected a 19% y-o-y rise, driven by a 7% rise in ad impressions and an 11% growth in average price per ad. Meta also reported a 5% rise in family daily active people to 3.29 billion. Most of the company’s revenue came from ad sales on Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp. The company is benefiting from its AI push, targeting more advertising. The company plans to use AI to generate more content. Not only did the company post higher revenues, its operating margin expanded to 43%, up around 300 bps y-o-y. Higher revenues and margin expansion resulted in earnings of $6.03 per share, up 37% y-o-y. Looking forward, Meta expects its Q4 revenue to be in the range of $45 billion to $48 billion. What didn’t sit well with the investors was the company’s hike in capital spending guidance to $38 billion to $40 billion and higher investments in 2025 as well. This compares with $27 billion Meta spent in capital expenditures in 2023. Much of the new investments are related to the company’s AI push involving data centers and related infrastructure. META stock, with 60% gains this year, has outperformed some of the other large tech stocks, including GOOG, up 21%, AMZN, up 28%, and MSFT, up 9%. However, we think META stock is appropriately priced now. We estimate Meta Platforms’ valuation to be $560 per share, aligning with its current levels. At $560, META stock is already trading at 25x expected earnings of $22.65 in 2024, compared to the stock’s average P/E ratio of 17x over the last three years. A rise in valuation multiple for META makes sense given the solid advertising growth lately. However, continued aggressive investments into AI also poses a slight risk if it would eventually provide a meaningful boost to the company’s earnings growth. For now, the story for most of the tech stocks is about valuation multiples. Some of them are trading at levels higher than seen over recent years. Although META stock has seen a 2x rise since 2021, the increase has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 23% in 2021, -64% in 2022, and 194% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. While META stock looks appropriately priced, it is helpful to see how Meta’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

Title: Vornado Reports Strong Office Leasing as NYU Master Leases 770 Broadway
URL: http://commercialobserver.com/2024/11/vornado-reports-strong-office-leasing-nyu-master-leases-770-broadway/
Time Published: 2024-11-05T18:40:41Z
Full Content:
© 2024 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Steven Roth’s Vornado Realty Trust (VNO) reported lower cash flow in the third quarter of 2024 than it generated in the previous year’s third quarter, but the real estate investment trust emphasized its improving office leasing numbers — with New York University agreeing to master lease 1.1 million square feet at 770 Broadway — with high rents as it winds down the year. During Tuesday’s third quarter earnings call, Vornado reported funds from operations reached $99.25 million in the third quarter of 2024, down from $119.48 in the previous year’s third quarter. Moreover, funds from operations for the first nine months of the year hit $352.9 million, down from $382.5 million compared to the first nine months of 2023. The firm’s dividend to shareholders in the third quarter ended at 0.52 cents per diluted share, less than 0.66 cents per diluted share in the third quarter of 2023. Roth struck a confident and defiant tone when reporting the firm’s financials, and said that Vornado expects to pay a dividend of 0.68 cents per share to shareholders at the end of the year in order to conserve cash. In 2023, Vornado suspended dividend payments beginning in April of that year. “While our business is financially better and improving, we’ll continue to be rigorous with cash management,” he said. “This strategy has been understood and is endorsed by our major shareholders. I expect as conditions normalize, so will our dividend.” Vornado president and chief financial officer Michael J. Franco said that the quarter’s financial results were expected to be down from the previous year due to “items previously forecasted,” notably recent vacancies at several Manhattan office properties. “This decrease was primarily attributable to lower [net-operating income] from known move-outs, largely at 770 Broadway, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, 280 Park Avenue, and higher net interest expenses, both of which we have previously discussed,” said Franco. Those move-outs included Facebook parent company meta dropping 275,000 square feet at 770 Broadway when its lease expires this year. However, Vornado got a break as it announced Tuesday that NYU agreed to master-lease the entire 1.1 million-square-foot office portion of the Broadway building. But both Roth and Franco pointed to encouraging leasing and occupancy numbers to make the case that the REIT’s office-heavy business model has finally turned the corner after several years of post-COVID uncertainty. Roth reported that year-to-date leasing reached 2.5 million square-feet company-wide, including 2.1 million square feet in Manhattan. He said that he’s confident the firm will reach between 3.5 million and 3.8 million square feet of leases in Manhattan by the end of the year, which would be the second-highest annual amount in the firm’s history, with “the highest starting rents ever.” “Activity is robust,” said Roth. “No new supply always begets a landlord’s market. Our rents are going up, I’m extremely optimistic, and the stock market seems to agree.” Vornado’s stock price opened at $42.81 on Tuesday, up from the $22.88 it sat at on Nov. 6, 2023. Aside from the NYU deal, Roth and Franco highlighted several other large leasing transactions in the firm’s Manhattan portfolio. Vornado leased 740,000 square feet of office space in the third quarter, including 297,000 square feet that Google renewed at 85 10th Avenue and leasing totals of 70,000 square feet of space at Penn 1, with an average starting rent of $119 per square foot. The NYU deal at 770 Broadway includes an upfront payment of prepaid rent that will allow Vornado to pay off its $700 million loan on the property, according to Roth. All told, the firm leased 2 million square feet in New York City across 68 transactions in the first nine months of 2024, with average starting rent of $112 per square foot, according to Franco. “The tide has clearly shifted in the New York, Class-A office market: leasing activity is strong and gaining momentum and availability are declining, particularly for large blocks of space,” said Franco. Vornado reported office occupancy of 87.5 percent in the third quarter, down from 89.3 percent in the previous quarter. Franco blamed the expiration of Meta’s lease at 770 Broadway for the small decline, but stated that the NYU master lease at the same office building will bring the firm’s office occupancy up to 90.8 percent by January. He also said vacant space at the newly opened Penn 2 has impacted occupancy levels, but that will also only be temporary. “The easiest money we can make is filling up our empties. As occupancy rises, earnings will go up,” he said. “Our office occupancy will likely decrease in the first quarter 2025, and as vacant space at Penn 2 is placed into service, we anticipate that this decrease will be temporary, and as Penn 2 stabilizes we get to 93 [percent occupancy].” Vornado also announced its portfolio’s retail occupancy rates stand at 78 percent, but Roth argued that excluding Manhattan mall vacancies brings the firm’s retail occupancy closer to 90 percent. “So, actually, we’re pretty well leased in above-the-market occupancies,” he said. “There is strong demand in retail and retail is certainly in much better shape than it was a couple of years ago.” The firm said it carries liquidity of $2.6 billion, with $1 billion cash on its balance sheet. “We are in a very strong capital position,” said Roth. “Our single focus is in creating value, being financially disciplined, and getting our stock price up to where we think the value is and where it should be. “In order to do that, we need to keep leasing, keep improving our balance sheet, and cutting out assets we don’t want, turning them into cash, and continue to work on the very significant and great asset pool we currently have,” he added. “But, actually, I’m all about the stock price.” Brian Pascus can be reached at bpascus@commercialobserver.com.

Title: What's Happening With Google Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/11/05/whats-happening-with-google-stock/

Google logo sign is seen outiside Google office in Krakow, Poland on October 19th, 2024. (Photo by ... [+] Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Alphabet stock (NASDAQ: GOOG) saw a marginal growth of over 1% last week, despite it reporting a solid quarter. The company reported revenue of $88.3 billion and earnings of $2.12 per share, both metrics well above the consensus estimates of $86.3 billion and $1.85, respectively. The increased demand for AI solutions drove the growth for the company. However, much of the positives appears to be priced in for its stock. In this note, we discuss the key takeaways from Alphabet’s results, its stock performance, and valuation. Also, check out should you Buy, Sell, Or Hold Amazon? Google’s revenues of $88.3 billion in Q3 reflected a 15% y-o-y gain. The growth was led by its cloud business, with segment sales up a solid 35% to $11.4 billion. Google search revenue was up 12% to $49.4 billion, and YouTube ad revenue was also up 12% to $8.9 billion y-o-y. The company’s self-driving car unit — Waymo — is now seeing 150,000 weekly paid rides. Waymo could be the next big thing for Google. See how Waymo could be worth $5 trillion. Not only did Alphabet see its revenue rise, its operating margin expanded 450 bps y-o-y to 32.3% in Q3. Higher revenue and margin expansion led to a 37% rise in the bottom line to $2.12 per share. Looking forward, we expect the company to post revenue of $96 billion in Q4, and earnings to be around $2.15 per share. While Alphabet’s results were solid, its stock price appears to have little room for growth, in our view. We estimate Google’s valuation to be $182 per share, reflecting only 6% upside from its current levels of over $170. Our forecast is based on 23x expected earnings of $8.05 per share in 2024. The 23x figure is higher than the stock average P/E ratio of 18x seen over the last three years. GOOG stock is trading at a multiple lower than some of its peers, with META trading at 26x and AMZN at 40x forward expected earnings. That is because there remains a key risk for Alphabet. Google is facing antitrust cases, alleging the company to monopolize the marketplace and the general search services. The remedies could include a breakup of the company, which seems unlikely for now, regulatory oversight, and restrictions on businesses, among others. None of these would bode well for Alphabet’s businesses in the long term. As such, despite a strong growth visibility in the cloud business, on the back of AI demand, and continued ad revenue gains, we think that the stock may not see any meaningful growth in the near term. GOOG stock has seen over 20% gains this year, broadly aligning with the returns for the S&P500 index. However, the change in GOOG stock over the recent years has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for GOOG stock were 65% in 2021, -39% in 2022, and 59% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. While GOOG stock looks like it has little room for growth, it is helpful to see how Google’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

Title: Will Wall Street allow Big Tech to make AI work?
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2024/11/05/will-wall-street-allow-big-tech-to-make-ai-work/
Time Published: 2024-11-05T06:00:00Z

Artificial intelligence (AI) is taking over – at least when it comes to the stock market and investors. In the past few months, we have seen the value of chip companies that have positioned themselves in the AI sector soar. Nvidia has overtaken Intel, a situation that might once have been unthinkable. Newcomers such as OpenAI and Anthropic have been making inroads into the market, attracting significant valuations from investors. And it seems that anyone who is anyone is getting involved in AI in some way. If there was any doubt that AI was attracting big money, a look at the most recent round of quarterly results should have put that to bed. Last week, several of the largest tech companies – Meta, Google, Microsoft, AWS – revealed increased spending on the technology as they each try to capitalise on the interest in AI. But there is more to come. Big tech companies are planning to spend even more in building their AI arsenal into next year, and hoping to persuade customers to adopt it at scale. The question is, will Wall Street give them the space to do it? Lest we forget, it is not too long ago that the same companies that are investing heavily in their AI capabilities were telling their staff that they needed to cut their cloth to fit the new economic reality, at the mercy of fluctuating share price. That new economic reality seems to include the shiny new AI toys, for which tech companies seem prepared to offer deep budgets. If the promise of AI is realised, then the billions ploughed into developing the technology will be seen as a sensible investment. But if not, it won’t be the first time that a much-hyped new technology fails to live up to the forecasts. Fully autonomous cars, which have been in development for years, have yet to reach any sort of meaningful market. NFTs promising a new wave of artists revenue, selling for outrageous sums, have fallen out of favour. And lets not forget the world of crypto. For now, Wall Street is watching, nervously. If there is a hint of the technology not reaching its potential, the money that has flowed in to AI companies could just as quickly flow out.

That was the conclusion of the S&P Dow Jones committee, which decides when changes need to be made to the 30-member index, long viewed as a key barometer of the U.S. economy. After markets closed on Friday, S&P said Intel is out. It's being replaced, on Nov. 8, by rival chipmaker Nvidia, which has ballooned to become the world's second most-valuable public company, just a hair behind Apple as of Monday. With the change, four of the tech industry's six trillion-dollar companies will be in the Dow, with internet giants Alphabet and Meta still on the outside. For those two companies, there are no obvious members to replace. Nvidia, on the other hand, recently leapfrogged Intel as the biggest chipmaker by revenue, creating a clear one-for-one swap opportunity. A defining characteristic of the Dow is that it's a price-weighted index. That means a stock's significance is based on its price and not the market cap of the company. In getting trounced by Nvidia in artificial intelligence while also losing share of its core PC and data center processor market, Intel has seen its stock price plummet by more than half this year, closing on Friday at $23.20. Now, Intel is by far the least-significant member of the Dow, with a weighting of less than 0.5%. The next lowest-priced stock is Verizon at around $41. With Intel being the only chipmaker in the index, the sector is underrepresented relative to its position in the economy. "A big part of the decision is that semis weren't being represented," Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said in an interview. "Sector representation and price is important." Nvidia's stock works in the company's favor. On a market cap basis, Nvidia would be worth an outsized 18% of the index, but its stock price will give it just the 21st highest weighting, behind Chevron and ahead of 3M. Nvidia positioned itself to join the Dow in May, when the company announced a 10-for-1 stock split. Silverblatt said the technology industry's weighting in the Dow will go up to about 19.5% from 18.9%, even though its market weight will be at around 58%. The bigger weighting change comes with Sherwin-Williams joining the index at the same time and replacing Dow Inc., bringing the materials sector to about 5% from less than 1%, Silverblatt said. As for Alphabet and Meta, the wait could continue for a long while. Amazon joined the Dow in January, giving the internet sector greater representation in the index. Alphabet's position is slightly complicated by the fact that its Class A and Class C stocks are both publicly traded. Meta's price of almost $562 would currently give it the heftiest weighting in the Dow, just ahead of UnitedHealth Group. Given tech's heightened overall representation, there are no obvious moves ahead that would include Silicon Valley's megacaps. "In order to put one in, you have to take one out," Silverblatt said.

Title: Securities disclosure over Cambridge Analytica data breach comes before court

The justices will return to securities law on Wednesday with arguments in a case arising out of the 2015 Cambridge Analytica-Facebook data breach. The tech giant’s effort to fend off federal securities fraud lawsuits in Facebook v. Amalgamated Bank could narrow the opportunities for private investors to hold companies accountable under federal laws that regulate corporate misconduct. In 2016, the British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica exploited the data of over 30 million Facebook users in connection with Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. After Facebook (now Meta) knew of the breach, but before Cambridge’s widespread use of the data was made public, Facebook issued a securities filing disclosing to investors the hypothetical risk that a security breach might cause harm to Facebook’s business and stock price. That disclosure did not reveal that, as Facebook was aware, a large breach of that sort already had occurred. Later, when Cambridge’s misuse of the data became widely known, Facebook’s stock price fell precipitously. The Securities and Exchange Commission and Facebook shareholders sued the company for securities fraud, arguing that the disclosures about the risk of a securities breach were misleading because they did not reveal what Facebook knew about the Cambridge breach. A federal district court dismissed their claims, holding that the risk statements were not false or misleading. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit reversed, prompting Facebook to come to the Supreme Court. This is one of those cases – regrettably common – where the parties spend as much of their time bickering about what question is properly before the justices as they do presenting their arguments on the merits. Paring away the contentions about what was and was not argued below and whose position has changed the most over the course of the proceeding, Facebook’s central point is that its disclosure about the hypothetical possibility that a data breach could cause it harm in the future is not misleading, and that the lower court erred in its contrary finding. Specifically, Facebook argues that this kind of disclosure – a forward-looking statement about future risks – should never be regarded as misleading solely because it fails to disclose that the relevant triggering event (in this case, a securities breach) already has occurred and well might cause harm to the company. Here, because nothing in the disclosure was incorrect – it is in fact true that a security breach could harm Facebook and its stock price, as history now teaches us. In short, the company says, Facebook cannot be held liable for what it did not say. The investors reject Facebook’s argument as seeking a categorical rule that gives companies a pass if they make a clearly misleading statement and put it in a forward-looking risk disclosure as opposed to some other part of their filing. From the investors’ perspective, the rule should be the same here as anywhere else; the only relevant question is whether the statement, taken in context, was materially misleading. The only thing that the lower courts held here is that Facebook can be liable if the statement, in context, was materially misleading. The investors, a bank and a public pension plan, are seeking compensation for the lost value of their stock. My guess is that the justices will be frustrated by how little the issues on which the parties discuss in their briefs resemble the question they agreed to review. In an effort to offer something predictive about what we might see at the argument, I would point to two things. The first is a deep-seated skepticism of securities fraud litigation held by some of the justices, who tend to view litigation in this area as akin to extortion based on hindsight. The court has also issued a number of decisions in recent years in favor of corporate interests that have weakened federal regulators, including at the Securities and Exchange Commission. On the other hand, it is a powerful benefit to the investors that the government filed a parallel suit against Facebook, contending that its disclosures about security breaches were insufficient; the government appears in full support of the investors and will share in their oral argument time. It similarly helps the investors that there is a forceful and direct friend-of-the-court brief signed by most of the most famous securities law scholars, arguing that the securities laws bar any kind of categorical exception for misleading statements made in forward-looking risk disclosures.

Title: World stocks tread water ahead of crunch US election

European and US stocks fell flat on Monday as investors treaded carefully before the US presidential election that will impact the world economy, with a US Federal Reserve interest rate cut also expected later in the week. In the US presidential race, Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump remain virtually tied in opinion polls ahead of Tuesday’s vote. It might not be clear who has won for days after voting ends. Mr Trump’s policies on immigration, tax cuts and tariffs may put upward pressure on inflation, bond yields and the dollar, analysts believe, while Harris is seen as the continuity candidate. “We are too evenly divided and polarised to suggest a red sweep,” Frank Luntz, Republican consultant and pollster, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum. “The Senate looks like it will swing Republican, but the presidency and the house are simply too close to call,” he said. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe added 0.3 per cent , while the dollar index, which measures the US currency against a basket of currencies, eased 0.29 per cent to 103.63. Iseq heavyweight Ryanair traded flat (remaining at €18) despite a court ruling pausing the effects of a Dublin Airport passenger cap that was due to imminently affect airlines’ access to take-off and landing slots over the summer 2025 period. The airline along with rival Aer Lingus last week brought an urgent application over the Irish Aviation Authority’s (IAA’s) decision to limit passenger numbers to 25.2 million for the period. Most of the other big players on the exchange AIB, Kingspan, Kerry and Glanbia ended the session in the red as investors awaited bigger news later in the week. Permanent TSB and hotel group Dalata were among the few shares to advance. European stocks retreated on Monday as caution over the imminent US presidential election weighed on the regional benchmark, though losses were kept in check by buoyant banking and energy shares. M&A speculation, especially in the luxury goods sector, sparked some sizable moves. EssilorLuxottica popped higher on renewed chatter that Meta Platforms is weighing a stake in the eyewear manufacturer. Elsewhere, Schneider Electric shares slipped after the French electric equipment maker named Olivier Blum as chief executive officer, just days after the group was among companies fined by French antitrust regulators over a price-fixing pact. European equities have drifted lower over the past month or so as investors brace for multiple risk events, including this week’s US presidential election, as well as interest rate decisions from both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. The UK’s benchmark FTSE 100 rose marginally on Monday, helped by energy shares, while cautious investors braced for the U.S. presidential election and a potential interest rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE) later this week. The blue-chip FTSE 100 was up 0.1 per cent at 8,184.24 points, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 dipped 0.1 per cent. The heavyweight oil and gas sector rose 0.7 per cent as oil prices jumped more than 2 per cent after a decision by OPEC+ to delay increasing output by a month. The personal goods sector, however, led sectoral gains, driven by an 4.8 per cent jump in Burberry after a report that Italy’s Moncler was considering a bid for the luxury retailer. The banking sector rose 1.1 per cent, supported by Natwest Group that advanced 2.6 per cent to a 13-year high. US stock indexes slipped in choppy trading on Monday, as investors braced for a pivotal week for global markets in which Americans will elect a new president and the Federal Reserve is likely to cut its benchmark policy rate. Some of the so-called “Trump trades” lost ground after a recent poll showed Ms Harris leading in Iowa, triggering a retreat in dollar, bond yields and bitcoin. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 397.83 points, or 0.95 per cent, to 41,654.14,and the S&P 500 lost 27.52 points, or 0.48 per cent, to 5,701.28. Most megacap stocks lost ground, with Tesla dropping 1.8 per cent as the EV maker’s China-made vehicle sales fell in October. However, chip heavyweight Nvidia rose 1.6 per cent, after S&P Dow Jones Indices said on Friday the company would replace Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Intel’s 4.3 per cent slide weighed on the Dow. - Additional reporting by Bloomberg and Reuters Eoin Burke-Kennedy is Economics Correspondent of The Irish Times Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Election betting sites pour money into social media ads ahead

Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time While the latest polls suggest that the presidential election may be a close one, some social media advertisements are painting a very different picture. In some ads for the online betting platform Polymarket, graphs illustrate former President Donald Trump’s lead as “up to 32% in the odds” over Vice President Kamala Harris, claiming the service is “the most accurate way to track the election.” What Polymarket isn’t always disclosing alongside the ads, though, is that the displayed percentages are actually odds tabulated based on bets placed with its service, not projections based on representative voter polling. Well over half of the ads don’t mention that the numbers are rooted in prediction-based markets. “The idea is if people disagree with the market price, they have the opportunity to capitalize by buying the side they think is priced too low,” Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan said in a social media post. Some ads for the platform read, “Don’t trust the polls — trust the markets.” The social media ads have flooded Facebook, Instagram, X and other platforms. On Meta alone, Polymarket has poured at least $50,000 into a campaign including 45 advertisements, which promote the odds, according to data available in Facebook’s ad library. One advertisement — viewed more than 900,000 times on Facebook and Instagram since Oct. 28 — depicts Trump winning in the Polymarket odds, according to the Meta Ad Library. Among the viewers, 20% are men ages 45 to 54 and 12% are women in the same age range. The advertisement was seen the most in California, New York and Texas, with 16%, 11%, and 10% of viewers in those regions, respectively. Several others include questions such as “Did serving fries help Trump’s chances?” or “Does Trump have all the aura?” Of the 45 Meta ads, many include solo images of Trump, some include side-by-side images of both candidates, and none include solo images of Harris. A separate sponsored campaign from the right-wing social media personality Shaneyy Richh included nine advertisements promoting Polymarket forecasts. “The full list of actual conservatives that get polled by political pollsters,” read one ad, which depicted a man squinting at a small piece of paper. “Tired of biased polls? Find out what’s really happening in the 2024 race,” the caption said. On X — owned by one of Trump’s biggest supporters, Elon Musk — advertisements also promoted the predictions on its search page. Polymarket, which offers bets in sports, business, science, politics and more, reports that users have spent more than $2.7 billion placing bets on the next president. According to an X post, one user bet $2.2 million on a Harris win. Based on user bets, Polymarket says Trump’s odds of winning are roughly 65.5% and Harris’ are 34.5% as of Oct. 31. “Odds on Polymarket are derived from the market price of a contract that pays $1 if an event occurs and expires worthless if it doesn’t,” a Polymarket blog post reads. “For example, someone paying 60 cents for a Trump ‘yes’ contract, implies a 60% chance that he wins.” Not all are quick to place bets or even trust Polymarket’s system. “Trump and right-wing influencers are pushing these Polymarket odds as a poll,” Claudio Vallejo, an online creator, said via a TikTok video. “They’re using these odds as proof or evidence that Trump is peaking at the right moment and is so popular that there’s no way he can lose in November. ... They’re laying the groundwork for ‘too big to rig.’” A company spokesperson referred to a “misunderstanding” of the company, explaining the stats are not opinion polls but odds calculated by shares traded on Polymarket. The odds aren’t meant to reflect public opinion; they reflect bettors’ level of confidence in either a Trump win or a Harris win. “A big point of confusion is that both vote share and odds are expressed as a percent, but do not mean the same thing,” Polymarket wrote on its Substack page. Coplan recently took to X to defend the platform as “non-partisan,” calling it a “reality check” meant to “harness the power of free markets to demystify the real world events that matter most to you.” “Polymarket is not about politics,” he wrote in a statement on X on Oct. 25. “This US election cycle, we’ve been pulled onto center stage, as people are fed up with having to make sense of ‘For You’ feeds, pundits, and incongruent polls — we take that responsibility seriously. ... Hopefully politics is the first step to get the masses to realize the value of market-based forecasts.” Though the ads are trending in the U.S., it is prohibited for “U.S. persons,” any citizen or even any temporary resident to take part in the betting, according to Polymarket’s terms. Currently, Polymarket requires bettors to accept terms and conditions confirming they are “not a resident, national, or agent of the United States” or several other countries where the platform is regulated against. In 2022, Polymarket was fined $1.4 million by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which said that it was illegally running events betting in the U.S. A federal appeals court recently overturned the CFTC’s decision to prohibit election betting company Kalshi from limiting “U.S. persons” from placing bets on their markets — but Polymarket wasn’t part of that suit, and the law that prohibits betting on Polymarket is still in place. Kalshi’s stats show a 59% and 41% division between Trump and Harris, respectively. The company has also used social media to promote election betting, spending over $140,000 on Meta ads, according to the company's ad library. While people in the U.S. aren’t supposed to place their own bets, a Polymarket spokesperson said the platform could be useful for Americans because it acts as a live information source similar to the stock market. The social media advertisements don’t explicitly encourage people in the U.S. to bet, but they also don’t include a disclaimer about the regulation. Nevertheless, the site is gaining attention from many right-wing officials and celebrities, including Trump himself. “We’re up in the polls pretty substantially. They have a new phenomenon, and that’s a gambling poll. They call it the poly poll or something I’ve never heard of,” Trump said at a rally in Michigan on Oct. 18, with a crowd member shouting out “Polymarket” to correct him. “Polymarket, and I guess it’s 64 to 38, 36, something like that. So that’s not bad. I don’t know what the hell it means, but it means that we’re doing pretty well,” he added. Though Polymarket called Trump’s reference to the company a “common error” of “confusing Polymarket odds with polls,” a paid advertisement shares the rally clip with the caption: “they call it the pollypoll or something.” The Instagram reel doesn’t include contain any similar clarification as the one on the blog post. Musk also took to X to share the predictions — then 67% and 33.1% for Trump and Harris, respectively. In another post, Musk said Polymarket odds were “more accurate than polls.” A Nov. 3 NBC News poll found Harris and Trump were deadlocked among respondents, each with 49% support from registered voters. Every major poll from the last week shows a split between the candidates from 0 to 3 percentage points, with most differences falling within the margins of error. Some experts warn people to use caution when they analyze both the polls and the markets. “When people look at polls, one is just expecting real precision at a specific moment,” John Fortier, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute focusing on topics such as election demographics and voting, told NBC News last week. “It’s not that we can’t get good information ... but if you’re really expecting polling to tell you ... what’s going to happen next Tuesday absolutely, obviously there’s just built-in margin of error.” Though Fortier said the financial risk associated with markets can be seen as a “more serious” gesture than answers on a poll, he emphasized “real doubts” and warned that “the details matter.” “I just see the possibilities for more market distortion,” he said. “I’m generally skeptical, and then I’m even more skeptical of a market that is narrower but also excludes American citizens.” Sophia Pargas is a news associate for NBC News. © 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Big Tech is spending eye-watering amounts on AI

Good morning. We’re 24 hours away from Election Day in the United States. Is anyone concerned about someone hacking the vote?According to a recent Pew Research survey of more than 5,000 American adults, the answer depends heavily on a person’s party affiliation.Fifty-two percent of voters are “at least somewhat confident” that U.S. election systems are secure from tech threats like hacking, according to the survey. A whopping 73% of Harris supporters are confident in that security—20 percentage points higher than Biden backers in 2020, no less. Yet a mere 32% of Trump supporters feel similarly, way down from 60% four years ago. A silver lining? Most voters, regardless of party affiliation, believe local poll workers and state election officials will do a good job during the election. Phew. —Andrew NuscaP.S. AT&T CEO John Stankey will discuss the future of U.S. infrastructure at Fortune Global Forum next week, Nov. 11-12 in New York City. Interested? Request an invitation here. Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here. The ROI of AI? Perhaps the single most pressing question in tech outside of who might occupy the Oval Office next year. Now that some of the world’s largest tech companies have shared their latest earnings, it’s clear the question is far from answered. The capital spending of four of the biggest U.S. tech companies—Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft—will likely top $200 billion this year, with little relief planned for 2025. Data centers are materializing. Power agreements are arising. Acquisitions are accelerating. It’s giving gold rush, as the kids say—and Wall Street is a little freaked out that ambitions are outpacing potential returns. (That is: “Delulu.”) On the final day of October trading last week, investors sold off enough tech stock to drive U.S. stock indices down and erase all of the gains they made that month. Microsoft shares dropped 6%, its largest one-day drop in years. Meta shares fell 4%. “This … is maybe not what investors want to hear in the near term, that we’re growing it out,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during a conference call. “But I just think that the opportunities here are really big.” To find solid ground, investors are looking at more tangible components of the revolution, such as semiconductor sales. But concerns remain. For example, even as Microsoft disclosed an annualized $10 billion in AI revenue, it acknowledged that rising costs and slowing growth would eat into its cash cow in the cloud. Funding the revolution might just be more challenging than fomenting it. —AN In the world of blue-chip stocks, one day you’re in, and the next day you’re out. (At least that’s what Heidi Klum might say if she were a day trader.) Nvidia, riding the AI boom that has proven so lucrative for the chipmaker, is set to replace semiconductor peer Intel on the benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average. The swap will be in place for trading on Friday, Nov. 8. The DJIA, which comprises 30 large companies, is among Wall Street’s oldest indices. It remains a powerful signal of success even if it has been criticized over the years for being too narrow to properly reflect sweeping economic changes. Intel joined the Dow in 1999, the same year as Microsoft; the pair were the first Nasdaq stocks ever chosen for the Dow. (It also happens to be the same year that Nvidia made its IPO for $12 per share. Ah, hindsight.) At the turn of the millennium, IBM and HP complemented the new additions to make four tech components to the Dow; today you’d be hard-pressed to find a firm that wasn’t trying to be in the tech category. —AN Big Tech peers Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have raced to sign agreements with nuclear power plants in a bid to fuel their energy-hungry AI datacenters. On Friday, one of them hit a major hurdle. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rejected a petition to connect a colocated Amazon Web Services (AWS) data center directly to Talen Energy's Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Berwick, Pennsylvania. The agreement, which would have increased the facility’s load capacity from 300 megawatts to 480 megawatts and diverted power from the regional grid, “could have huge ramifications for both grid reliability and consumer costs,” said Commissioner Mark Christie in a statement. (Talen responded by saying that the decision “will have a chilling effect on economic development.”) The U.S. government and industry seem to be aligned that the development of artificial intelligence is a matter of national security; what’s still to be worked out is who will shoulder the burden. Watch this space. —AN Chinese researchers have created a military AI tool based on Meta’s “open-source” Llama 2 13B large language model, according to Reuters. Meta’s claim that its Llama AI models are “open-source” is hugely controversial, because of its licensing restrictions and the fact that it doesn’t reveal the source of the training data. But that doesn’t change the fact that Meta is making its models available for free, along with the parameters (“weights”) that make it easier to customize them. Per Reuters, that’s what these Chinese researchers have done, creating a model called ChatBIT that can aid military decision-makers and intelligence officers. Meta’s licensing restrictions forbid using Llama in military contexts, but what’s the company going to do? This is sure to inflame the debate over whether “open-source” AI is such a bright idea after all. —David Meyer Ming-Chi Kuo, the TF International Securities analyst known for having a reliable line on Apple’s supply chain, says an affordable Apple Vision Pro is further out than you’d think. “Production of the cheaper Vision Pro has been delayed beyond 2027 for a while now,” he posted Sunday on X, the social media service. “This means Apple's only new head-mounted display device in 2025 will be the Vision Pro with an upgraded M5 processor.” Apple’s $3,500 “spatial computer” was announced in June 2023 and hit the market nine months ago. Though most reviewers found the augmented reality device to be awe-inducing, they just as frequently found it impractical for real-world use. Estimates by IDC in July said Apple would fail to end the year with more than 500,000 units sold. According to Kuo, that’s part of why this delay might be acceptable to Apple. “Simply reducing the price wouldn't help create successful use cases,” he wrote. “It's similar to the HomePod situation—even after launching the cheaper HomePod mini, Apple's smart speakers failed to become mainstream products.” —AN —Elon Musk can’t dismiss ex-Twitter CEO’s severance claim. Parag Agarwal may proceed, a judge rules. —The CHIPS Act hasn’t seen much action. $33b approved; $123m awarded. —Peloton’s new CEO is a Ford and Apple veteran. Two words: Digital services. —Is awkward Alexa-speak not long for this world? Amazon is reorienting its famous assistant around LLMs. —Steve Ballmer wants to improve democracy with data.

Title: The hour of reckoning in the US, oligarchs applying pressure and making demands, the cabinet reshuffle and Schinas, the tax troubles of Kasselakis’ father with the IRS

Hello, the hour of reckoning has arrived for the new leader of the free world, and naturally, this week, something quite dramatic would need to happen to shift the spotlight from this major event that occurs once every four years and politically, geostrategically, and economically impacts the whole world. Judging by the polls and predictions on both sides, we may find out the winner more than 48 hours after the polls close, though any forecast could simply end up being guesswork. We… – Now, as for us as a country, it doesn’t take a genius to see we’d prefer the Democrats and Kamala, though it’s neither in our hands nor the end of the world if things don’t go that way. After all, there are ties and balances, and our relationship with the U.S. has strengthened more than ever over the past few years, aided by the dynamic presence of Ambassador Tsounis. We shall see. An interesting week is dawning. In Athens… – In Athens, the government is currently occupied with various important, though not earth-shattering, governance issues. Meanwhile, bizarre tales, straight out of Latin America, are coming to light and have become the talk of the town. You might say it’s the old story of “same old, same old” in Greece. Another thing Greece has “always had” – and something this administration, as well as K.M. himself, will also have to deal with – is the wear and tear of a second term. This includes inevitable signs of arrogance, along with increasingly bold and demanding oligarchs and special interests. And naturally, the “regular” folks, whether businesspeople or media tycoons who aren’t asking for money or power, are fewer and fewer and are likely running low on patience. This calls for special caution, because, as we’ve seen before, internal opponents play a role here, and in this instance, some of them are even the same people. For example, Samaras, who toppled Constantine Mitsotakis’ government, wouldn’t hesitate to take down Kyriakos Mitsotakis’ administration if he could. Now, I don’t know if he has enough MPs at his Sunday gatherings, allegedly eating souvlaki and plotting (LOL), or if he could align with Karamanlis’ group, though the Rafina resident is more restrained and less impulsive than Antonis, who some say might even be angling for an interim prime minister role. Though personally, I’m not sure who or what this transition would be for. At any rate, there are eager oligarchs ready to lend support, and let’s not forget the opposition, which now includes Nikos Androulakis, who is flexible and notably open to media support and more. Well, the man is just doing his job, and if he manages to stabilize at 20% or higher, he’ll certainly be playing in the big leagues. Cabinet Reshuffle – Maximos Mansion – Schinas – Thus, the next big topic already buzzing in political offices and business salons around Athens is the upcoming cabinet reshuffle, which will most likely happen after the presidential election, in three months, meaning “wait and see,” especially with K.M., who not only keeps his cards close but also recalibrates based on timing, especially for reshuffles. One juicy tidbit I heard (amid other whispers of people rejoining the government, which has become somewhat cliché) concerns former Commissioner Margaritis Schinas. Rumor has it that Margaritis, now back in his hometown of Thessaloniki, is gearing up for a powerful ministerial position, possibly even as Foreign Minister, replacing Gerapetritis if K.M. decides to bring him back to Maximos Mansion – something that doesn’t seem all that far-fetched. Again, I emphasize that this is just information and not a “guarantee,” as we used to say, since there are still more than three months before any reshuffle. Kasselakis Sr. – Legal Troubles – As for developments in SYRIZA, while we’re all following them, they no longer have that freshness; they’re not “juicy” anymore. Still, here’s an interesting piece of news related to the democracy champion Stefanos. Today, the Council of State (sixth chamber, if I’m not mistaken) is hearing the case of Kasselakis’ father, who famously owes €11.5 million in taxes. This debt stems from an old issue regarding a villa he owned in Ekali, which the SDOE tax investigation agency found was owned by him via an offshore company, leading to significant penalties. Given that the five-member council had upheld prior rulings from lower courts (first-instance and appellate), it’s likely that today’s seven-member council will reach the same conclusion as the previous judges. Nevertheless, he has his day in court, so we wish him “good luck.” Only Two Portfolios Stick to the Business Plan – The red loan market is facing substantial challenges. At the Ministry of Finance, there’s a report by KPMG on the Hercules scheme, which notes that only two NPL portfolios – Frontier and Galaxy in the corporate sector – are progressing according to the business plan. All other portfolios are facing issues ranging from minor to major. Simultaneously, secondary market transactions have slowed down, Intrum has agreed on prices for the sale of seven portfolios but has yet to close the deal, discussions are underway for acquisitions between servicers, even major ones, and the market is generally getting tougher and more demanding. It’s only a matter of time before we see restructuring moves that will lead to stronger entities managing the next phase of red-loan liquidations. PPC enters a new business sector – Establishes “PPC INSPECTRA” – PPC is embarking on a new venture, with its management setting up an independent subsidiary following the operational split of its existing Laboratories, Certification, and Inspection Department (DEPE). The goal of spinning off this division and forming a new company called “PPC INSPECTRA” is to accelerate the expansion of DEPE’s activities (which would be difficult to achieve through organic growth alone) and to penetrate more effectively into the Laboratory Services, Inspection, and Certification (Testing, Inspection & Certification – TIC) market, where demand is high. Strategically, the aim is for the new company to become the preferred TIC provider and offer all the services required by clients in this market (a one-stop shop). Establishing this new subsidiary is the main topic of today’s extraordinary shareholders’ meeting, which is expected to give the green light. Additionally, it’s noted that with the spin-off, DEPE will be able to acquire and integrate other businesses operating in related fields, expand its client base, and grow geographically. This move is favored by the conditions in the Greek TIC market, which is highly fragmented, with the top three companies (Bureau Veritas, DNV, TUV Hellas) collectively holding a 30% market share, while more than 350 smaller firms operate in this space. Notably, DEPE has been part of the former Innovation Center (DKK) and the earlier Center for Testing, Research & Standards (KDEP), and has been providing testing services to PPC’s units and external clients for over 50 years. Since the project is already well underway, DEPE has applied for certification as an Accredited Certification Body from the National Accreditation System (ESYD). The Golden Dividend of… Retired Executives – The Sarantis brothers, Michalis and Takis, might now call themselves “retirees,” having handed over the leadership of the Hellenic Dairies Group (Olympus, Rodopi, Agno, Kliafas, Tyras, etc.) to their children a few months ago. However, they still have a say in strategic decisions and continue to reap the rewards of their years of hard work. This year, they are set to receive a “golden dividend” of nearly 6 million euros. The group is expected to surpass 600 million euros in revenue and 100 million euros in EBITDA this year. In terms of net profitability, based on the decision to distribute dividends, performance is expected to be remarkable, especially when compared to competitors who are now lagging behind. The Rothschild & Co Greece Headache – Rothschild & Co, the prominent investment bank with an expanded presence in Greece in recent years, appears to have a “headache.” Five years ago, it evolved from a simple office into a full-fledged subsidiary called Rothschild & Co Greece S.A. Last year, Marios Broustas was appointed CEO, while the long-time head of the Greek office, Nasos Zabaras, took on the role of Chairman. The subsidiary aims to make a stronger push into the M&A advisory sector, hoping to fulfill the ambitions set by its parent company, as, so far, the balance sheet isn’t exactly thriving. Official reports show a reduced turnover in 2023 of approximately 862,000 euros, with pre-tax losses of 900,000 euros and after-tax losses of 748,000 euros. The company raised its share capital by 2 million euros to reach 2.025 million euros and also received a 1 million euro loan from the parent company via an open credit line. Consequently, its equity turned positive, reaching 726,666 euros, although its working capital (current liabilities minus current assets) remained negative. It’s worth noting that the company has secured a commitment from its ultimate shareholder to provide financial support over the next 12 months to ensure uninterrupted operations. The Surprise – At year’s end, the Ministry of Finance plans a “surprise”: a General State Balance Sheet with almost zero deficit. This means Greece will not only present a primary surplus of 3% to cover interest and debt payments but also a general surplus, having serviced its loans. Many in the Ministry suggest using this surplus to repurchase high-interest loans from the past, thereby dramatically reducing both debt service costs and nominal debt. As major European economies (France, Italy, Spain) dangerously increase their public debt, Greece stands out as a fiscally disciplined economy that reduces its debt and grows at twice the EU average. This is the picture that Finance Minister K. Hatzidakis will present at today’s Eurogroup meeting. The next challenge is for all Greek households to feel this unprecedented fiscal improvement, a goal pursued by the new tax reform bill entering public consultation today. Why They Are Buying EYDAP and EYATH – The government has launched a large-scale water management project with EYDAP leading in the South and EYATH in the North. Inevitably, these major investments and changes will bring new pricing. The implementation has begun, with the new “Regulated Asset Base” (RAB) framework published a month ago, increasing assets by 30% over the current level. Institutional investors are already taking notice, systematically buying shares of EYDAP and EYATH. Despite a declining stock market, EYDAP gained +1.4% last month, reaching a capitalization of 612 million euros with 4,705 trades involving 713,000 shares. EYATH, the “smaller, more conservative” entity, maintains a capitalization of 117 million euros, with 52,316 shares changing hands within the month. Brigadier General Evangelos Mytilineos – Metlen Energy & Metals sponsored the renovation of the 7th Company building at the Hellenic Military Academy. The group’s subsidiary, ELEMKA, fully renovated 2,500 square meters of facilities, upgrading cadet dormitories, common areas, and improving energy efficiency. At the official opening ceremony, President Katerina Sakellaropoulou awarded Evangelos Mytilineos the honorary title of Brigadier General, along with a commemorative statuette and ceremonial sword from the Academy. “Black Friday” Turns Into “Black November” – Traditionally in the U.S., “Black Friday” falls on the last Friday of November, right after Thanksgiving, when retailers clear out old stock at huge discounts to make room for new inventory. In Greece, however, Black Friday has turned into “Black Week” and now “Black November.” Major chains, led by Public, have already started sales, with Kotsovolos announcing a major event at the Mall this week. All stores are launching offers since the usual mid-November sales won’t take place, while retailers aim to secure early holiday spending that consumers will receive in late December. What Buffett Fears—and Expects – Warren Buffett, the “Oracle of Omaha” and renowned contrarian investor, didn’t buy a single stock during the third quarter. As American markets hit record highs and Wall Street experiences a buying frenzy, Berkshire Hathaway has continued to sell stocks, pushing its cash reserves to an unprecedented 325.2 billion dollars. Even with Apple—the market cap leader heading toward 4 trillion dollars—Berkshire has reduced its position, selling 14.3 billion dollars’ worth, leaving its stake at 69.9 billion dollars, or 25% lower than the previous quarter. In total, over the past two quarters, Buffett sold Apple shares worth 100 billion dollars. While selling stocks, Berkshire has simultaneously increased its holdings in U.S. Treasury Bills to 288 billion dollars. Those who view Buffett as a “wise investor” and follow his strategy closely may face a tough week ahead on Wall Street. Not All IT is Golden – Twenty-five years ago, in November 1999, at the peak of the dot-com bubble, Intel was added to the Dow Jones Index as a sign that “IT is the future.” Back then, Intel traded at 42.25 dollars. If someone had invested 10,000 dollars in Intel stock at that time, their investment today would be worth around 5,500 dollars (plus any dividends received). Today, Intel is being removed from the Dow Jones Index, replaced by the well-known Nvidia. Nvidia’s shares have surged +180% this year as tech giants demand its high-powered processors that fuel AI, the technology now seen as the future. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, created by Charles Dow in 1896, is a beacon for the U.S. stock market. Unlike the S&P 500, which weights companies by market capitalization, the 30-stock Dow Jones is price-weighted, meaning higher-priced stocks have more impact. This is why the Dow Jones includes stocks like Apple, Microsoft, IBM, Salesforce, and Cisco Systems, while companies like Google, Amazon, and Meta are absent.

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Major technology stocks like Meta Platforms and Microsoft fell after their latest earnings as Wall Street was spooked by their mounting expenses and AI spending. With election-related uncertainties and the need for portfolio diversification, dividend stocks remain in focus. Data shows dividend growth stocks have outpaced inflation over the past 23 years. However, choosing the right dividend stocks and ETFs in today's market remains a key question for beginner investors.

About a year ago, a dividend investor shared his detailed income report and story on r/Dividends – a discussion board for income investors with over 600,000 members. The investor said his investing account was started with $60,000, which he saved in his 403(b) retirement plan while working at his first job for eight years. He then rolled over this money into an IRA. The investor said this $60,000 rose to $1.2 million in 27 years from 1996 "without putting any new money." "During that time, I have experienced tremendous market ups/downs like the internet (tech) bubble/burst, housing bubble/burst, Great Recession and recent Covid-19 crash and recovery. During all these times, my focus was the growth of company stocks, mutual funds and ETFs. My core holdings were always SPY and QQQ about 50-70% and occasionally some speculative stocks about 20-30%," the investor said. Trending: These five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends He highlighted that he stayed invested in the market during all these ups and downs. The investor said he is now retired and switched his focus to dividend investing in 2022. "My only regret is that I should have switched to dividend focus a little sooner when I had $1.5m, but I guess it's life. Its projected dividend yield is ~9%, but I will be content with ~8% dividend yield." The investor clarified that most of his portfolio gains came from when he focused on growth. "The only dividend I have received during my accumulation phase was from SPY & QQQ. I heavily focused on growth," he said. The investor’s portfolio screenshots showed his monthly dividend income of about $9,495 or $113,949 per year. Most of his holdings were dividend ETFs. Let's take a look at the portfolio. JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSE:JEPI) was the biggest position in the portfolio of the investor earning $9,495 per month in dividend income. The portfolio screenshots showed he owned 5,323 shares of JEPI, worth about $288,187 at the time. The investor raked in about $32,933 in annual dividend income from the ETF. JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) was the second-biggest position of the Redditor, earning $9,495 per month in dividends, as his position in the covered call ETF was valued at about $268,275. JEPQ distributes monthly dividends, invests in Nasdaq companies and generates extra income by selling call options. The ETF yields about 9.2%. Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? The Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 The Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) is one of the best ways to enjoy dividend income and capital gains through stock price appreciation as the ETF exposes some of the top tech stocks in the NASDAQ-100 index. The fund pays quarterly dividends and yields about 0.6%. The investor owned 544 shares of the fund, according to the screenshots he publicly shared on Reddit. During the discussion on his post, the investor commented about his conviction in the QQQ: "Since I am much younger than Buffett, I also have faith in QQQ. I have faith in American entrepreneurship and technological creativity. So, my core holdings are always SPY and QQQ." The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust One of the key perks of investing in The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) is that it allows you to see your capital grow and get quarterly dividend payments. The fund has a dividend yield of about 1.2%. The Redditor earning $9,495 per month in dividends had 433 SPY shares in his portfolio, valued at about $181,868. The investment brought in $2,792 in annual dividend income for the investor. Ares Capital Ares Capital Corporation (NASDAQ:ARCC) is a business development company with a dividend yield of about 9%. The investor had 5,820 shares of Ares Capital in his portfolio, worth about $109,532 at the time. The investment earned about $11,174 in income. Global X Russell 2000 Covered Call ETF The investor earning $9,495 monthly dividends had an $82,000 position in Global X Russell 2000 Covered Call ETF (NYSE:RYLD). The fund generates income by selling call options on the small-cap-heavy Russell 2000 Index. The ETF yields about 12%. Being a covered call ETF, RYLD can incur losses during down markets. Trending: Unlock the hidden potential of commercial real estate — This platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF The iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (NYSE:HYG) provides investors with exposure to U.S. dollar-denominated high-yield corporate bonds. It tracks the Markit iBoxx USD Liquid High Yield Index, which comprises a broad range of below-investment-grade bonds. The fund has a dividend yield of about 6%. YieldMax TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF YieldMax TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSE:TSLY) is a popular YieldMax dividend ETF for high-yield seekers. With a distribution rate of over 60%, TSLY generates income by selling call options on Tesla shares. Over the past year, TSLY has been down about 42%, while Tesla is up 28%. Guggenheim Strategic Opportunities Fund Guggenheim Strategic Opportunities Fund (NYSE:GOF) exposes investors to fixed-income and other debt securities. It invests in various credit instruments, including corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities and other high-yield debt. However, it's a risky investment because it invests in ungraded bonds, also known as junk bonds. The investor, who earned $9,495 per month, had 776 shares of GOF in his portfolio. This investment generated $1,695 in annual income. iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond BuyWrite Strat ETF iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond BuyWrite Strat ETF (BATS:TLTW) invests in U.S. Treasury bonds with 20 years or more maturities. It also generates income by selling call options on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement 20+ Year U.S. Treasury Index. The current interest rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through publicly-traded REITs. Arrived Homes, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform, has launched its Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. It paid 8.1% in August. The best part? Due to high demand the maximum investment amount is currently $5,000 with a minimum investment of ONLY $100.

Title: Nvidia to join Dow Jones Industrial Average, replacing rival chipmaker Intel
URL: https://www.nbcnews.com/business/nvidia-replaces-intel-dow-jones-rcna178524
Time Published: 2024-11-02T18:31:05Z
Full Content:
Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Nvidia is replacing rival chipmaker Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a shakeup to the blue-chip index that reflects the boom in artificial intelligence and a major shift in the semiconductor industry. The switch will take place on Nov. 8. Also, Sherwin Williams will replace Dow Inc. in the index, S&P Dow Jones said in a statement. Nvidia shares have climbed over 170% so far in 2024 after jumping roughly 240% last year, as investors have rushed to get a piece of the AI chipmaker. Nvidia’s market cap has swelled to $3.3 trillion, second only to Apple among publicly traded companies. On Friday, Nvidia shares rose 1%. Intel shares were down 1% in extended trading. Companies including Microsoft, Meta, Google and Amazon are purchasing Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs), such as the H100, in massive quantities to build clusters of computers for their AI work. Nvidia’s revenue has more than doubled in each of the past five quarters, and has at least tripled in three of them. The company has sginaled that demand for its next-generation AI GPU called Blackwell is “insane.” With the addition of Nvidia, four of the six trillion-dollar tech companies are now in the index. The two not in the Dow are Alphabet and Meta. While Nvidia has been soaring, Intel has been slumping. Long the dominant maker of PC chips, Intel has lost market share to Advanced Micro Devices and has made very little headway in AI. Intel shares have fallen by more than half this year as the company struggles with manufacturing challenges and new competition for its central processors. Intel said in a filing this week that the board’s audit and finance committee approved cost and capital reduction activities, including lowering head count by 16,500 employees and reducing its real estate footprint. The job cuts were originally announced in August. The Dow contains 30 components and is weighted by the share price of the individual stocks instead of total market value. Nvidia put itself in better position to join the index in May, when the company announced a 10-for-1 stock split. While doing nothing to its market cap, the move slashed the price of each share by 90%, allowing the company to become a part of the Dow without having too heavy a weighting. The switch is the first change to the index since February, when Amazon replaced Walgreens Boots Alliance. Over the years, the Dow has been playing catchup in gaining exposure to the largest technology companies. The stocks in the index are chosen by a committee from S&P Dow Jones Indices. © 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Feel free to skip one more pundit’s view of the Budget if you’ve had enough. I’m not claiming to be John Maynard Keynes. This is just how I see things. When asked why he robbed banks, the US heist wiz Willie Sutton said: “Because that’s where the money is.” Those hit by what passes for wealth taxes in Labour’s October Budget should sigh and say the same. Yes, capital gains taxes have gone up a little. But entrepreneurs and investors with money to spare outside of tax shelters – or the gumption to start a business – don’t do it for a few percentage points of tax arbitrage versus income tax. We do it because the £760,000 you’re left with after a now-24% levy on every £1m you make in gains is still life-changing, compared to the average UK salary of £36,000 a year. No, you soon won’t be able to pass along a multi-million pension pot to the next-generation tax-free. But the state doesn’t provide tax reliefs for pension savings so that your kids need never work again. It does so to encourage you to save for a time when you can’t or won’t yourself. Scrapping the Lifetime Allowance for pensions doomed the IHT ruse, and the trade-off is a sensible one. Higher stamp duty when you buy a second-home or investment property? Well I don’t like transaction taxes on principle. But if we’re going to have them, then at least this targets the pointy-end of the property market. Reversing the 20-year advance that landlords made versus first-time buyers continues. With house price to income ratios still off the charts and buying in the South impoverishing-to-impossible for most young people without a suitcase of cash from mum and dad, I’m at peace with that direction of travel, too. Real wage growth in the UK has been flat since the early 2000s. Near-zero interest rates for more than a decade after the financial crisis only inflated the wealth of those with assets – even as the bottom half that relied on lowly wages or state benefits saw their standard of living go nowhere, before the post-Covid inflation shock squeezed them for what was left. If you’re really upset by Rachel Reeves’ Budget then you’ve probably either done very well – relatively-speaking – for the past 15-20 years or else you’ve been in denial about the state the UK is in. Count your blessings. I’m fully aware that Monevator has wealthy readers and we’re generally pro-capitalism and getting ahead around here. So this isn’t a sermon that’s likely to have our parishioners throwing their hats into the air. But a reckoning was overdue and here it is. We need to manage the UK as the middle-ranking mostly pretty poor country (judged per capita) that it now is. Not pander further to the fantasies of post-2016 populism. Some friends of mine bemoan a return of ‘the politics of envy’. But I just see a return to the politics of reality. This was not a perfect Budget. Not even judged by my standards, which is akin to judging how well an ambulance crew performs when it arrives to find the patient already blue on the floor and gasping. The biggest tax-raising measure – the hike in employer’s national insurance – can only hurt growth in itself, even if spending money had to be raised somewhere to stave off worse. At the margin it will make the young and low-skilled less employable. Hospitality and retail will suffer. And personally I wouldn’t be taxing jobs harder with a potential AI revolution at the door. But income needed to be found. This country couldn’t take another round of austerity, even if it had voted for it – which it didn’t do in voting for Labour, or for Johnson years beforehand. To get itself past an electorate either unwilling or unable to face facts, Labour had sadly boxed itself in with red lines around the other big revenue raisers. So here we are. Even with the tax hikes, Reeves’ additional borrowing has slightly rattled the gilt market – although I judge much of the fairly modest rise in bond yields we’ve seen is ongoing recession risk being taken off the table in the US, with knock-ons around the world. I see the Budget as only adding a kicker. So it’s far from another Disastrous Mini-Budget. However it is a bit of Show Me The Money concern. Everyone sensible knows the UK needs growth. The State needs it, and we need it in our pay packets. Neither I nor the OBR thinks this Budget will do much for growth over the long-term. The latter forecasts a little boost upfront and then if anything a gentle decline in the long-term. That’s not good enough. But again, what’s the alternative? The UK electorate voted to make itself poorer in 2016, rightly or wrongly. That bill – plus the same for preventing a potential depression during Covid – has come due. Decisions have consequences. Even if you don’t agree with Goldman Sachs, the OBR, and other mainstream economists that leaving the EU is indeed on its way to costing us the 4-5% hit to GDP that was predicted and is playing out, not even the lunatic fringe can divine any Brexit dividend. Ironically the only reason things aren’t worse economically is because immigration has gone through the roof. Going it alone could only have boosted the UK’s economic prospects with the deregulated ultra-capitalist ‘Singapore on Thames’ model. Boris Johnson rejected that years before Reeves took charge. So we’re back to tax and spend – except it’s as much to keep the lights on as to invest in infrastructure. Still, that’s better than austerity at this moment in time. Labour’s political opponents have understandably focused on taxes going up after Labour’s election pledges in spirit implied no such thing. Fine, but firstly their manifesto didn’t add up either. Both sides have seen this country prove for a decade that it will only vote en masse for pretty lies. Secondly, what would the Budget haters do differently? Cut services further? Everyone can see they’re falling apart. Cut taxes to stimulate growth? We couldn’t even afford the last unfunded bung. Fudge the books by not being frank about spending commitments and promising investment and ‘levelling up’ that was just rhetoric plastered on top of a crumbling national fabric? Oh yeah, we tried that. I say be careful what you wish for. As for our own wallets, well I can still put £80,000 a year into tax shelters – via ISAs and pensions – and I can invest my way to a comfortable retirement without some silly lifetime cap on my gains. The tax-free lump sum was left intact too. None of the nightmare scenarios came true. Not even flat-rate tax relief. If you’re a high-earner you can easily make yourself a multi-millionaire helped by those reliefs, without starting so much as a lemonade stand in terms of real risk-taking. Can any of us – hand on heart – say that isn’t still plenty of room to do well for ourselves? There was even the rabbit in a hat of the freeze on income tax thresholds being lifted in 2028. A half-boiled bunny for sure, but if I was Reeves I’d have extended them further and not hiked employer’s NI. As for being clobbered by the supposedly crushing fist of the leftwing unleashed, according to the Budget calculators I’m about £1.36 a year worse off from Reeves’ measures. So let’s have some perspective. The actual ultra-left – Jeremy Corbyn and his fellow travellers – have penned an open letter condemning this Budget as ‘austerity by another name’. Reeves has not solved anything with her Budget but it shouldn’t make things worse. Given the rubbish place we’re starting from, that’s no mean achievement. With luck she’s bought time for a few good years and a fortunate break or two to get the UK economy going again. That might give us a bit more room to be bolder. We’re overdue a bounce. But I know many of you will disagree, one way or another. Before we kick things about in the comments, let’s remember Labour hasn’t been in charge for 14 years. Let’s not pretend the UK was humming along before somebody let the long-haired students in to seize the levers of state. And if Liz Truss is reading, I got some stick for not totally sticking it to your Budget, because you did sort of address the elephant in the room – the lack of economic growth. Unfortunately that message was wrapped in a package as convincing as a man with a billboard crying the end of the world is nigh. Which ultimately only made the markets and the electorate less tolerant of radical action. No, Britain signed up for gentle decline years ago. The spirt of the 52% is like an old person blustering around a care home talking about the good old days and complaining he can’t understand the nurses’ accents. Now Barry Blimp is moaning that he has to take his medicine. I’m shocked. Sorry, but the grown-ups are back in charge. They’re doing what they can, but that’s only so much. As for the alternative, I’d love to hear a well-argued and costed counter-narrative spelling out a lower tax, higher growth future with a respectable welfare state left intact – as judged by the electorate, not the rich flying by to their private stand-ins. And that’s certainly not coming from the Tory leaders in waiting. So tax, spend, and muddling on it is. Have a great weekend!

Or peruse a few of our best articles. Completely agree with your comments and sentiments on the budget. For most of us much ado about nothing, and partially at least corrected some imbalances. As you say I’ve not come across a viable alternative that somehow magically combines lower taxes with better services and growth. I wish it existed. Mostly concur with your budget analysis, especially around IHT and pensions. I disagree with hitting lower earners disproportionately via employers indirectly though. I think that will serve to ensure the poor stay poor. The elephant in the room I think is still NHS spending and continuing the bonfire. I also cynically thought that Reeve’s offer to unfreeze income tax bands inflation linking in another 4 years was quite a rather large slap around the face with a wet fish for everyone – obviously (a) just in time for the next election (b) 4 years of back peddling still available (why even bother promising it??) (c) everyone gets to keep bending over in the meantime. The beatings will continue until morale improves, eh? Either that or she doesn’t seriously expect to still be in #11 by then. Thanks for the links which are excellent as always and you’ve certainly had your work cut out this week! The idea that Labour has no real choice in delivering such a high taxing and high spending budget due to Brexit is for the birds. Wage growth was low well before 2016, the misallocation of capital due to artificially low rates has also costed the economy, including misallocation of spending by previous governments. Look at public sector productivity ? Look at high energy costs ? The ££ spent on recent renewables subsidies i.e. AR6 and the exorbitant costs to keep gas fired plants on standby? Increases costs throughout the economy. Plenty of leavers to pull without going back over the Brexit ground, yes of course it’ll disrupt trade – withdrawing after 40+ years of closer economic integration will do that – but there are many things within UK control that successive governments have chosen not to do. Mostly agreed that this budget was not much about real change and that is mainly down to there being little wriggle room, given years of the rulers leaving the nation’s wealth in the pawn shop. Financial bleeding from both feet between the brexit and covid corruption self-sanctions doubled down on the losses, so the country is not bankrupt suddenly, there was a long period of gradually before that. So as you conclude (no doubt unpalatable for the empire-loving generation) the UK is at best a struggling middle-ranking country now and the next responses will determine which way it goes. Sadly, on that note, massively expensive legacy nuclear capacity was justified as a deterrent to being attacked, which a non-belligerent country could use to just pay for a defence force from then on. But as the ‘~£3 billion per year for as long as it takes’ allocation shows, even as the taxpayers have to tighten their belts, forever wars with no relevance or benefit to us are the priority. (No referendum on that though) The NI thing was cleverly implemented in my opinion, by increasing the rebate for hiring staff. My business which hires 2 staff on decent salaries + 2 directors on minimum wage will actually be a few thousand better off than before, though after 5 staff total it heads in the other direction. Not a bad trade off in my opinion (and manages to catch the “single employee” corporations too, which is fair). Mostly I’m relieved they didn’t touch pension tax handling, and stunned they didn’t slash ISA allowances. If I were chancellor (and less self interested) those would have been on the block… Excellent work,, Thank you!! Genius quotes “We need to manage the UK as the middle-ranking mostly pretty poor country (judged per capita) that it now is.” and “Both sides have seen this country prove for a decade that it will only vote en masse for pretty lies.”. Great analysis and agree most of those seeking FIRE should be mighty relieved that the Budget wasn’t much worse, given the huge sum Reeves needed to raise to cover the economic mismangement of the last lot. She has sensibly stated there will not be another Budget until next Autumn so we can breathe easy for another 12 months. Noteworthy that most of those complaining are at the very top of the wealth distribution which I suspect is exactly what was intended. @jds247. Agree the NI changes were cleverly implemented – also in a small business and our NI bill will fall due to the huge rise in Employment Allowance. So in some ways the new system is now more progressive. The problem is the mounting/runaway debt crisis which no one talks about The populace is still not ready for the required adjustments to correct this situation so politicians keep kicking the financial debt ball down the road Are we ready for Argentina type actions which seem to be working in that country admittedly from a much worse starting point? It would be sad if it actually has to be a financial crash that brings people via their politicians to a sense of financial reality-ie you can only keep spending more than you earn for a finite length of time before your debts become overwhelming xxd09 I can’t say I’m enthusiastic about paying increased rates of CGT on a nominal gain on disposing of an asset that’s worth less now in real terms than when I bought it. Surely if there was a tax that needed to be reformed and could actually help to generate revenue, it would have been a review of council tax. Lower priced bands could have been left frozen or areas deemed deprived or where house prices have not risen at a level relative to the South East could have seen a fall, while more expensive bands seen a lift. This could then be used directly for local services and fund city/regional mayors and also show that more resources are being raised locally and spent locally. I agree the IHT on pensions thing is justifiable, but it still hurts! I have formulated a work around though which also solves the CGT problem and will start to enact it this year. Love the recommendation for ‘Confederacy of Dunces’ – it’s a great book that is long overdue a re-read! Might want to check the spelling of the link though @TI (A general comment rather than this article specifically) It’s easy to say “the UK is in decline, I want to move” – and plenty of people have been in recent months, indeed since Brexit. But where to move to – is there anywhere better? Obviously this depends on personal factors too. But I’d love to see some pieces going into this more, discussing specific places, if you don’t consider too far outside this site’s scope! I largely agree, although insisting that the national insurance increase be paid by GP practices and care homes and the like is a big mistake. I’d anticipate a U-turn if this were the Tories of recent times. Not sure if this government are inclined to react to public outcry in that way though. I think you know I don’t agree with all of your comments, I’ll add that as a rider rather than rehash the almost decade long argument here. However, there is a contradiction in what you write above, both Brexit was bound to make us poorer and also Boris Johnson ruled out a Singapore on the Thames free trading nation – that is the beauty of our parliamentary system and the movement of time – anything Boris wanted or didn’t want can be changed. This budget wasn’t ‘grand’ which a lot of people were expecting from a first budget. But between the budget and the signalling between the election and now I think it’s signalled some significant direction changes, which will mean the economy will be different in five years as these incrementally ratchet up. Some of them will be positive – and some of them will lead to more growth. Ie, almost totally missed, but the minimum wage has risen by 6pc and working age benefits by 1.4pc. Do that three times in a row and the incentives to work, with all the positive mental and physical (there is after all one ‘health’) benefits attached. There is likely to be less immigration as the notion ‘English people won’t do those jobs’ becomes ‘Oh, English people wouldn’t do those jobs for an extra £10 a month but for an extra £500 over benefits now we’re talking’ That’s important because gdp per capita needs to rise, and ending the farce of paying benefits to deliveroo riders from abroad and benefits to English people for not working is an obvious way the country can get richer Also, the war on BtL continues apace. It’s been years, and years, but I’m 42 and have friends that earn well, finally now the talk is about ISAs and pensions and tbh BTL isn’t what it was. That means investment in the real economy AND first time buyers being able to achieve dream of home ownership – as immigration falls with more Brits working hopefully that’ll improve things All in all, there are levers to pull – and this may have been the firing shot in pulling them – incrementally. I’d prefer Nigel to be in charge but I think it was an ok budget for growth Growth only comes by getting Brits into work. I did nothing and I’m not that unhappy. CGT will hit me but I’m not crying. But what was amusing was the Daily Mail publishing two or three articles a day in the run up with panicking suggestions to take pensions now and get the maximum commutation before the evil Chancellor reduced it. The day after the DM headlines were that people who did this were tricked by the same evil Chancellor who caused the panic Also – I only learnt this this week – the stamp duty surcharge is on second homes or additional homes. So if you have a second home, sell your own home and buy another home (to live in) it’s not due. Anyone who saves many thousands of pounds via this knowledge please let me know I’ll send you my number to venmo me. And a quick last one about the 80k (81k if using a LISA?)… …on this the signalling was stupid. I exceeded my annual allowance in 22/23 but was saved by both (or more accurately either) of the previous two years. Since then the allowance has jumped up 20k and have some additional cash. I am currently not contributing this to my pension because I worry they may change the annual allowance in the future and I’ll need the excess this year to avoid a charge. Or they’ll introduce a lifetime allowance. Or they’ll raise the age I can get at it (whilst 58 isn’t old by any means I mean if they tinker and put it to 70)… …must be millions people up and down the country not investing in pensions because of their stupidity in signalling changes Good points and analysis, as usual @TI! @TA: thanks for the amazing post on how to buy inflation linked gilts. With 2-year yields going up on Thursday and the market expecting higher inflation next year after the budget on Wednesday, I got myself a bit of a bargain on Thursday! Cheers 😉 @all — Thanks for the comments. Going to let the conversation breath. Will just expand below a bit on Brexit as I really didn’t want to bog my intro down with it again. I understand we’re all fed up with it, even if that doesn’t wish it away! 🙂 @SurreyLad — Yes I agree Brexit isn’t the whole cause of the state we’re in. I didn’t say it was. I said our malaise began since the early 2000s. Brexit was a folly that the country couldn’t afford. The US might be able to afford Trumpian tariffs, say. But we needed everything to go right to squeeze as much as we could from our dehydrating lemon. An analogy might be Germany, which could afford some more leftwing policies and so on (and trains that ran on time! 😉 ) until Russia invaded Ukraine. Europe can’t afford to be silly anymore, the world is too ruthlessly competitive and the low-hanging fruit was long ago picked. The US has transitioned to the new era, thanks partly to its hyper-scaling tech platforms that arguably its culture supported the creation of. (The old culture, not current culture-wars culture). We haven’t got that luxury. (Well the French and Italians have Luxury brands, but we have… struggling Burberry and Mike Ashley!) If you believe, as I do, that Brexit has probably cost us about 5% of GDP (not least taking into account what we might have done if we’d focussed on other stuff, as well as all the frictions etc) then that’s £35-40bn of lost tax revenues I’m afraid. Do I think that’s *exactly why* Reeves just raised taxes by £40bn? No, but it’s certainly suggestive and in the mix. Unfortunately I can’t see me not mentioning Brexit for at least the next decade. I know it’s frustrating and boring, but my stance has always been that it’s a slow bleed/headwind, and the nature of that is, as I said from 2016, that the costs will compound. One thing we all know about around here is that compounding adds up mightily over time. 😐 Also – if Trump wins and Elon gets his way, the govt in the states may employ roughly a third less employees than it does now ( Twitter is down 65pc). If that happens, should be a lot of people in non jobs in ‘our’ NHS finally get the boot. Along with local councils etc. let’s not pretend everyone in the NHS works in ambulances or A&E – replace a few fax machines and receptionists for modern technology, remove all the diversity coordinators and likely have a better service for less money. Get Brits back to work, drill baby drill, and slash the cost of the nhs. @Southbank #13 But where to move to – is there anywhere better? Obviously this depends on personal factors too. But I’d love to see some pieces going into this more, discussing specific places, if you don’t consider too far outside this site’s scope! This is much easier when you are younger. Obvs because you have the dynamism and flexibility of youth, and you have a less complicated life, as Mark Zuckerberg observed in his “Young people are just smarter” quote. But no man is an island. Your human relationships matter, just not in a financial sense. I think there are plenty of sites on geo-arbitrage and digital nomadism, and on strictly financial criteria this can work very well. I’ve forgotten who it was on here who observed in the comments what is the point of achieving financial independence if you have to move away from family and friends to do it? There’s a tremendous variation in the value of these non-financial connections to different people. But I agree with his sentiment. Finance is but one aspect of living a good life, and it would be a shame to win that particular battle and lose the living a good life war. It is far less amenable to generalisation because it’s very multivariate. And no, AI isn’t going to give you the answer, TBH anyone who trusts anything AI tells them deserves all they get! Sadly this is one conundrum you have to compute yourself, on manual, and with input from any significant other people in your life. My sense is that this/our community is rather relieved it’s dodged a bullet…for now. So sleep is easier for now. Managed decline of the UK has been deemed simply too unpalatable to be told to the electorate since WW2. How many times do we hear “sixth richest country/economy ” and so on. Never the more honest “25th richest country per capita using purchasing parity and falling”. And it’s not because that’s a complete mouthful. So for that reason I’m not particularly optimistic that there will not be Willie Sutton style raids on where the money is. Especially when expectation gap of for example the UK health service and what the UK can actually afford is huge. Pure entitlement IMO. In the end healthcare will be rationed in some shape or form because we can’t afford 1st class healthcare and all the other 1st class public spending wishes. It means levelling down in most respects then it will only be a matter of time before they follow the money that’s left to find ..any money. Sounds depressing really. Levelling down because large tax rises with no/slow growth is levelling down pure and simple. So it wouldn’t surprise me if taxes on eg all housing equity principal residence or not, removal of tax free this and tax free that are part of the inevitable tax collection mission creep. After all the excuse “what choice did we have” seems to have passed without much protest and you’ll be hearing that a lot more often I suspect. On a brighter note I have also made my rolling index link gilt ladder. @Naeclue (#11) – If you don’t mind sharing the details of your plan, I would be very interested on reading about your ideas. Perhaps I could try something similar 🙂 I do expect my children to do well without any inheritance windfall from us. Just as I have done well myself without ever receiving any inheritance. I have even told my parents, I expect them to please just carry on living indefinitely and that I do not want to receive any inheritance from them. On the other hand, if I can help my children a bit more without them expecting it and counting on it, I think it can only be a good thing. @TI – sensible analysis I think and thanks for the links, I enjoyed Ian Dunt’s take on it. After all the press hype it seems like quite a balanced approach to me. @Southbank, Ermine – I did exactly this when I was a new grad in the post 89 recession. Of my class about half went to Hong Kong and most of the rest including me went to Germany. It was of course easy to do, all the Single Market privileges in my case, full professional recognition etc. It was just a matter of packing a rucksack, a bit of language training and having about £1k in ready cash. I ended up getting a job within a week. Now at the other end of my working life I’m actively looking into moving elsewhere but its a much more weighty decision to take when you have even modest assets ie house, pension ISAs etc. Still, I’m looking forward to a ‘research’ trip in Spring.. @BBlimp #15 but I’m 42 and have friends that earn well, finally now the talk is about ISAs and pensions @BBlimp #18 Or they’ll raise the age I can get at it (whilst 58 isn’t old by any means Aging 16 years in one day is a tough gig This budget is a significant rise in public sector spending. About 4% in real terms. That will put UK public sector spending in the mid 40s as a % of GDP. Right in the middle of the pack compared to our European peers. If this doesn’t deliver good public services – and I very much doubt it will – then there can be no further excuses from the left that we are underspending. Perhaps, we can finally switch to understanding why the public sector has such incredibly poor productivity. At a personal level, the budget was mildly negative. I have very little outside tax wrapper that is vulnerable to CGT. I have a few houses but as a percentage of net worth it’s <5%. Making pensions subject to IHT is also not a biggie. I plan to transfer 80% of net wealth to my kids in their 20s. The remainder we may/may not spend depending on how asset returns pan out. We'll re-sequence to optimize IHT but if it gets caught, it gets caught. If we somehow live to 100, my children wouldn’t get that inheritance till they were 60. Bit pointless getting it that late. If you wanted to reverse per capita income on PPP falling you could 1. Expand LHR, Gatwick, London City 2. Drill for shale 3. Allow housebuilding even when it interferes with habits of newts 4. allow the London sphere and don’t worry about ‘light pollution’ 5. Examine why HS2 cost so much more than it would have in France, let alone Shenzen. If we want to be travelling on the Elizabeth line rather than the northern line, we need to go through the issues with planning and growth, unpick them; and get building. Sadly, the Tories and Labour are two sides of the manage decline coin. But things aren’t as bad yet as they were in the 70s, trust me when they are, someone will come in and do all the above. It’ll be a shock to all of you that don’t realise we chose managed decline with every silly growth defeating measure we employ @Tom-Baker Dr Who >I do expect my children to do well without any inheritance windfall from us. Just as I have done well myself without ever receiving any inheritance. I don’t think this is necessarily a good comparison. Compare and contrast the amount of money your peers inherited with the potential inheritance of your child’s peers. @BBlimp — Given you’ve been wrong about pretty much everything for the best part of that decade that we’ve been debating — quite literally, from the outcome of Brexit to the kind of Brexit we’d get to Liz Truss — then perhaps you might first put your hands up for the damage your decisions have already caused to the UK and say “I got it wrong” before lecturing us that “It’ll be a shock to all of you”. Basically we’re indulging you here. Wake up man! 🙂 Was happily drawing my retirement income from tax free ISAs and keeping under the IHT limits but the IHT pension changes in the budget mean a sudden potential £200000 IHT bill So…….will continue with the ISA (no tax) withdrawals but will be running down my ISA totals to a lower level than originally planned Spending money just to save tax is always at the back of my mind as a not a sensible policy but…….. Potentially must get rid of £200000 over the next few years over and above current income requirements-now aged 78-time is running out! Any suggestions? Gifts,buy new cars,up grade those holiday hotels,charities etc etc xxd09 @remoaner – is that a joke? I’m 42 NOW, currently I can get he pension in 16 years, and I’m worried that during those 16 years the rules might change. You seem simple. @TI – would you like to comment on the growth suggestions or just continue ad hominem. What exactly is unlikely to be pro growth about expanding the airports for eg? @xxd – live another 4.5 years ? @xxd09 – ‘all of the above’ I would say! I’m imagining you as some sort of Brewster’s millions remake.. great problem to have. You could have a lot of fun. Just want give @BBlimp some support here. You are not alone. I really like your writing and insights. I’m new to having money and came across your site in an effort to educate myself. I also agree with your viewpoint in this article. @bblimp — is not ad hominem in this context. You said Brexit was the bright new economic future and derided remoaners etc. Brexit has at the least achieved nothing and all sensible economists agree there’s been a substantial cost. I said it’d slow growth and hit us all. It has. See the budget. Thanks for the Brexit share of the tax hikes to achieve nothing. I’m not going to debate your daring proposals to expand loads of airports and pretend climate change isn’t happening. It’s the same facile Blimpian rubbish that brought us Brexit. The world is complicated. I’ve wasted far too much time over the years arguing with you guys that yeah, the world is not flat. Policing this thread to keep comments on the Budget topic from here. Cheers. If we are c. 4% of GDP worse off as a result of Brexit (btw what does that mean in real money?) does that mean that if we’d remained in the EU our economic performance would have been up there with the US and China? And would have bitten all other EU countries into the dust (since we aren’t that far off now)? And you really believe that?!? Also btw, I am already seeing businesses planning to pass on cost increases as a result of the budget that exceed those implemented during the post COVID /Ukraine/Suez period. @David — You write: If we are c. 4% of GDP worse off as a result of Brexit (btw what does that mean in real money?) does that mean that if we’d remained in the EU our economic performance would have been up there with the US and China? And would have bitten all other EU countries into the dust (since we aren’t that far off now)? And you really believe that?!? No, I didn’t say that. It is tiresome to have to repeat the same thing over and over again. At least as much as to hear me mention Brexit every three months I’m sure. 😉 I believe that we’re 4-5% smaller in GDP terms. Nothing more, nothing less. That’s about £100bn in real money or about £35-40bn in lost tax receipts to the state. As I said in the article. Which is about the size of Reeves’ tax hikes. Or maybe we could have unfrozen income tax thresholds a few years ago. Or done a bunch of other useful stuff with the foregone money. Brexit was lost on the reality that economies are complex and fiddly things. Commentary since has proven people still don’t get it even after we’ve seen no dividends, sunlit uplands, booms, resurgent manufacturing, whatever. We have made our trade terms a bit worse. We’ve reduced skilled migration of the most amendable sort. Companies have reduced (not stopped) investing here to access Europe. These things all add up. As I linked to the other week and haven’t time right now to do again, the UK grew faster than other EU countries over the time we were in the EU. I can see it’s confusing if someone ignored this reality and believed lies to the contrary pre-vote. But that’s the reality. We ‘should’ be growing faster than the EU. We should be a richer country than we are now. The flipside of that isn’t a Mad Max wasteland, it’s a slightly less dynamic economy and a more cash-strapped state. As I’ve written many times, you feel a recession when GDP goes negative to the tune of 1-2%. So 4-5% is meaningful. We haven’t gone negative in the sense that these are ‘opportunity cost’ losses, but we’re feeling it in our relative standing and our ability to live as we did (public services etc). But again, this isn’t the whole story, agreed. Covid, 0% interest rates and malinvestment, truly terrible political leadership for a few years — it’s all in the mix. I suggest doing some reading about Dave Brailsford’s ‘marginal gains’. That’s the way modern economies work, outside of war and pandemics. Sure standing on a box and blustering about bright futures and animal spirits etc can be helpful, but only if it’s accompanied by an underlying reality. So Thatcherism, say, had a lot of rhetoric but it was backed up by (messy) deregulation. I’m sure in that case the political posturing helped it along. Economically speaking, Brexit was posturing on the back of a negative development. No dice. Again, let’s leave Brexit here or it will crowd out the conversation about the Budget. Felt I had to reply to this apparently well-meaning comment but will be more likely to delete from here for the sake of the Budget conversation. Cheers. I’m a simple minded miner, I part read the book “die with zero” and I seem to remember when it was mentioned when would your kids need help best with finances when they are older and probably settled?40+ and maybe struggled to get there themselves or maybe get something earlier on in life when setting out; I didn’t think too much of it at the time when reading. After this budget I actually now think hmm maybe the author was on to something and a small pile now before any iht and any possible meddling with pensions and tax free limits on savings may be in order. I think I’ll dig the book out and read the whole of it this time, maybe there is something to learn from a multi multi millionaire after all compared to my modest life savings which I’ve saved after tax and to the rules of the game. @xxd @miner Would your kids preferred you spent £200k or they got 200k? Would your kids prefer you spent £200k or they get £120k? As someone who simply cannot spend £4 for a cup of tea in pret and likely will never be able to whatever situation I’m in, i understand why you struggle to spend. So maybe you could take them on holiday ? Do up their homes now ? I know part of the holidays may constitute a gift but your parts wouldn’t be ! I wish my parents would spend their money. We’ve gone from full-fat cakeism to diet cakeism. But cakeism it still is. A year or two of real-term increases in public expenditure is not going to fix over a decade of chronic underinvestment. Maybe the roof will stop leaking for a bit. @The Investor. I know you don’t want to talk about THAT “B” word as it detracts from THIS “B” word, but I’d feel like the knockee in a game of Knock Down Ginger if I can’t respond on just one point: “I believe that we’re 4-5% smaller in GDP terms.” Is that each and every year, or a one-off hit? @David — Fair enough (but other commenters let’s please leave it here, I already fear the Budget conversation has been derailed given how the comments have trailed off 🙁 ). To answer your question via a neutral third-party, here’s how the latest version of ChatGPT puts it: The consensus across models and studies suggests that Brexit will likely reduce UK GDP by 4-5% over the long term compared to if the UK had remained in the EU. This translates to an estimated loss of tens of billions of pounds annually in economic output. The effects stem largely from reduced trade and investment, supply chain disruptions, and productivity impacts. [Various reports on the GDP gap emerging deleted for brevity] The estimated 4-5% GDP reduction from Brexit is not a year-over-year loss but rather a permanent reduction in the level of GDP compared to where it would have been if the UK had remained in the EU. This means that the UK economy is expected to be 4-5% smaller on an ongoing basis than it would have been without Brexit, affecting growth in a cumulative way over time. In Practical Terms If the pre-Brexit UK economy was projected to reach £2.5 trillion by a certain year, a 4-5% permanent reduction means it might instead reach around £2.375 trillion. Future growth compounds on this lower base, creating a long-term economic gap compared to a “remain” scenario. The OBR for one has been documenting this ongoing process and goes into quite a lot of detail, which you can read then believe or disbelieve as you see fit. 🙂 One part that makes no sense in the budget, as the Sky article right points out, is the fuel duty freeze. That would have been an easy lever to pull, with no pre-election commitments affected and much headroom to be gained. I’m hoping the renewable generation fees will at least move from electricity to gas in energy bills after the electricity pricing review is completed… > To answer your question via a neutral third-party, here’s how the latest version of ChatGPT puts it: Come again? “A known inveterate liar with a penchant for making stuff up quoth thusly” doesn’t advance the sum of knowledge one jot. Perplexity.ai brazenly assured me that the answer to what was the novel in the 1970s that had a young fellow field recording in Paris with a Nagra tape recorder is Gunther Grass’s The Tin Drum. A search of the novel for Nagra came up with a null result. Don’t believe anything that AI tells you. It makes Boris Johnson look like a bastion of truth-telling. The book was probably Odier’s Diva from 1979 I honestly wondered where TI got the 5pc lower gdp figure from – chatgtp. Blimey it’s beyond parody. Completely tragic. Explains so much. So, so, much. TI is presumably queuing up to believe covid came from bat markets, Russia caused Brexit, goodness knows what else !!! Thanks goodness Elon bought Twitter. @TI, yes, another pundit’s view from you on the budget but one I’ve been looking forward to seeing, along with the perspectives of Monevator readers. Thank you also for all the interesting links this week – and every week. The budget again underscored how challenging it is to find the best path forward for us in the UK, and how many diverse and opposing views there are. I think the impact of the budget is different for everyone, depending on one’s worldview, and, from an investment perspective, one’s personal circumstances. I have for example never had any gains subject to CGT – all our investments are in ISAs and SIPPs. However, the move to include pensions within IHT from April 2027 is something I need to consider. I understand the rationale behind the IHT changes, and the contrasting moral views there are on IHT. While I appreciate our fortunate position, I still have an obligation to minimise the tax we pay. We had planned for whatever remained of our pensions on our deaths to be passed to our children, and several charities. Over the years this has been in our calculations and always in the back of my mind. It’s at least partly why I keep on doing ‘one more year’. Our assets fall into three categories from an IHT perspective: the family home, ISAs and personal effects, and pensions. Perhaps I’ve invested too much in pensions over the years. You and Finumus have written about being careful not to indiscriminately pour all your savings into pension contributions, but for me that 40% tax relief was just too tempting! Another factor for us, as it has been for @xxd09 and others, is that we’ve never felt the need to have too much house – again leading to us making more pension contributions. As it currently stands, the house plus ISAs and personal effects would not result in an IHT liability. However, come April 2027, if we combine all three categories, our estate will be liable for IHT. I’m considering gifting the family home to the children earlier rather than upon death. I’m contemplating @ZX’s (#27) thoughts on the value of providing more financial assistance to the children at a younger age. There’s a lot to consider in the calculations – gifting the family home and then paying a market-related rental until we move in a year or two, inflating the children’s income during this period, checking if there is indeed no stamp duty on gifting because there’s no remaining mortgage, the risk of not surviving the seven years, etc. And, of course, there’s always the possibility that the change doesn’t come into effect in April 2027, or that other changes are made before that date that reduce our options. @ermine — Well I’ve tried explaining it myself and I’ve tried linking to the OBR, Goldman, others, and that didn’t work, so I thought this might be fun. Obviously I vetted the ChatGPT answer before posting — and obviously I posted knowing I was setting myself up for some ribbing. 😉 I would get over this AI FUD thing you have going on personally. 🙂 It’s great for general overview stuff, particularly if you know a subject OR you’re not too bothered about every fact being right. In the first case you can spot problems, in the second case the errors don’t really matter if you want the gist. I’ll chat to it if I want to learn about a subject as if talking to a once knowledgeable friend with a lapsed memory. I did this quite recently with the European conquest of America. It’s quite funny if you spot an obvious error and point it out. It will always correct itself, but of course it’s all a magic show and a re-weighting. And if you want to break it with logic it’s trivially easy to do so. The current version is far better than that of a couple of years back, but I do feel they are capping out on the current path. The rate of progress has slowed, but the illusion of intelligence is still more amazing to me than not. 🙂 There’s an evens chance we’re moving mostly away from a search engine paradigm to an ‘answer engine’ paradigm, so at the least good to keep a toe in as I see it. It’s a painful budget but in my view necessary as we can’t go on with the underfunding and lack of investment in our public services. See crumbling schools, overflowing prisons, highest ever NHS waiting lists, endless strikes, etc etc. If anything I think they did a decent job of spreading the pain around, a bit on pensioners, a bit on workers, a bit on business, a bit on landlords/investors, a bit on the wealthy. And all within the constraints of the manifesto commitments (sort of). I did work out how much extra tax my employer will now pay in NI for me and it’s quite a lot, so I fully expect a smaller wage increase next year. But it seemed like a reasonable way to reverse some of Jeremy Hunt’s blatant electioneering. I’m glad they didn’t touch the ISA allowance and only made minor amends to CGT. I feel like they could have been bolder with regards council tax, but maybe that’ll be after the next election maybe, when Labour are more trusted on the economy (assuming things go okay from here). Now they’ve got the unpopular stuff out of the way it should be easier over the next 4 years to give a good news story of how they’re turning the economy around, much like Osborne and Cameron did from 2010 to 2015. Some of the stamp duty changes are a bit mad, ie allowing the thresholds to reduce in Apr’25 and increasing the additional home charge to 5%. (The latter will only bring in £200-£300m tax revenue so just seemed like a bit of a swipe at 2nd home owners and landlords, still they didn’t increase CGT on property at least.) Will be interesting to see how those changes affect the housing market and rental supply over the next 6-12 months. All in all though it’s good to have adults back in charge actually trying to improve the country rather than the Tory Brexit psychodrama, the neverending Boris scandals, or the Truss/Tufton Street madness. Now we can just laugh at Badenoch when she says crazy things and not have to worry that she’ll actually be able to fulfill any of it. @BBlimp — If you don’t know where I got the 4-5% figure from then you (a) haven’t been following the news (b) haven’t been reading the links I sent you. Okay, let’s put the ChatGPT thing to one side. Here are those arch liberalists, Goldman Sachs, earlier this year: Post-Brexit Britain has “significantly underperformed” other advanced economies since the 2016 EU referendum, according to new analysis from Goldman Sachs, which aims to quantify the economic cost of the Leave vote. In a note last week entitled “The Structural and Cyclical Costs of Brexit,” the Wall Street bank estimates that the U.K. economy grew 5% less over the past eight years than other comparable countries. The true hit to the British economy could be anywhere from 4% to 8% of real gross domestic product (GDP), however, the bank said, acknowledging the difficulties of extracting the impact of Brexit from other simultaneous economic events including the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2022 energy crisis. Real GDP is a growth metric that has been adjusted for inflation. https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/14/brexit-has-sliced-5percent-off-uk-economic-growth-goldman-sachs-says.html Google around. It’s an easy question for ChatGPT to answer because all sensible reports find roughly the same thing. I was only replying to @David as a courtesy for the reasons he gave. Enough Brexit for this thread please. @24Tom-Baker Dr Who, my work around involves gifts of capital gains bloated ETFs to charity and is best explained by an example. Let’s say I take £250k from my SIPP and give £200k of ETFs to charity. The taxable amount is reduced by £200k and then by about £12.5k by the personal allowance, leaving about £37.5k. Tax on that at 20% is £7.5k, so I have about £242.5k net cash from the SIPP after the tax refund comes through. Put £20k into an ISA, then live off and distribute the rest. There is no CGT to pay on the gift of the ETFs to charity. If this process is repeated regularly over a few years the gifts to relatives would be considered gifts from income instead of PETs. The original plan for our SIPPs was eventually to take an income from them at basic rate, topped up by ISA withdrawals once our GIA investments were gone, and then to leave the SIPPs to relatives after we die, but there is little point following that path now. Instead we will make large withdrawals and distribute surplus income to 15 nephews and nieces. They are in their 30s to early 40s and most of them are sensible with money now, a few not. Only a couple are high earners and the money will be very useful to them. Likely far more useful now than in 25 years or so. “Britain signed up for gentle decline years ago” Yes, that’s the reality the UK has to face. It’s all about access to cheap energy and the UK no longer has that. There’s an economic inflexion taking place, but nobody (especially politicians) wants to face the cold hard facts of what such a phase transition entails. https://surplusenergyeconomics.wordpress.com/2024/11/02/292-fake-it-till-you-break-it/ @TI “Policing this thread to keep comments on the Budget topic from here.” Thank goodness for that, I don’t come here to read Daily Wail claptrap. I was beginning to think someone might pop by to say that Brexit failed because of the millions of trans Muslims arriving on little boats, being given council houses, claiming collosal benefits, breeding like rabbits, raping our women and stealing our jobs. It costs a lot to mend public services after 14 years worth of them being run into the ground. I’m not sure that increasing ENI will be the way to improve growth and the projected figures from the OBR look underwhelming at best. As for productivity in the NHS – loads of capital investment needed in diagnostics – things like scanners many of which are currently past their sell-by date and constantly breaking down. It’s also difficult to treat more patients when the building is falling down and they’re presenting as older, sicker with more co-morbidities and can’t be discharged because to all intents and purposes social care has been left to fall apart. As for getting rid of loads of diversity NHS staff – there aren’t that many according to official figures and they are a current legal requirement arising from the Public Sector Equality Duty (PSED) – something that’s never mentioned in the red-top comics. Following all the precursive doom-mongering, relieved that the somewhat vanilla (from a personal finance perspective) budget seems instantly forgotten with the slightest flutter of the other ‘B’ word red-rag. Although not so much into the politics, there doesn’t seem to be much that’s going to start swinging the ship round. At least they haven’t scuttled it. The Budget ? It proves that turkeys do vote for Christmas. The fault lies with the hopeless previous Conservative administration however. If I had a plan to build say more schools and hospitals and wanted you to pay for it how would I go about it ? Would I assess where they were needed, get them designed, get the approvals and permissions in place, get initial costs, put them out to tender…. Then I would need the money. Takes a while. Or I would ask for the money now, without plans or numbers, and say trust me. I won’t spend the money on anything else while I am waiting. At least I know when I am being plucked. After years of experience so I should. I concur that, on the face of it, those of us who keep things simple, with a single home, pension – such as a salary sacrifice DC and/or SIPP, and wrap any non-pension wealth in ISAs should probably breath a sigh of relief. TI makes a good point that we can still sock away £80k pa in tax advantageous accounts. They haven’t even hiked council tax – I am sure this will come for the top 2 or 3 bands in the next budget. Any pay rise next year is likely to be reduced by my employer to compensate for their NI hikes, but that seems to be the worst of it – although this is with a very narrow personal finance focus. I might have been more annoyed if I was planning to use my pension to dodge IHT, as an irate Labour voting colleague was. “But aren’t you happy it is going to the NHS?” I stopped myself from saying. Will leave the political commentary at that, but keen to hear if people think any of the leaked household wealth taxing policies the press made such a fuss about will make an appearance in next year’s budget. @TI Not a reply on Brexit, but on AI……that was a really clear well explained reply, that meant I did not have to hunt around for something as clear. I was speaking to a business owner the other day who when WFH uses some readily available AI (not CGP) to bounce off ideas as if they were a very knowledgeable work colleague – and gets a consistently better response. Which heralds businesses being managed in the future by one person + AI …. Bottomline is that this budget – it’s priorities for investment and how it wants to allocate the cost for them – will all be rendered obsolete by ‘Events, dear boy, events’. It’s hard to imagine that many of the forecasts beyond 25/26 survive contact with the global economy. Moreover, the forecasts assume levels of public sector productivity growth that look heroic. Health/Social care generating 2%/annum? Yes, right! One of those events happens on Tuesday and it will have a far greater impact on UK finances than this budget. The big three economic blocs – US, Europe and China – will decide how our economy performs and whether we can afford those public services. We’ll just have react, as best we can, to their decisions. That’s the nature of being an relatively small, open economy on the periphery of major regional blocs. I accept the IHT on pensions, but I do find it irksome that the billionaires who have snapped up farmland have only been asked to pay 20%, but us relatively little guys are being charged 40%. @Southbank 13. Re moving. Don’t forget a 10 year rule is coming into effect next year. The whole thing is beginning to get a flavour of serfdom. Just a quick note on my comment about the Daily Heil encouraging people to take comutation before the budget. Their headline “I took money out my pension before the budget.Can I put it back in” https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/pensions/article-14029673/I-took-tax-free-cash-pension-Budget.html “ with a potential AI revolution at the door.” I’ve been pondering this for a while in a different context. Warren Buffett has sold some of his Apple shares and is sat on pile of cash. Because: everything is too expensive. Prem Watsa is doing the same., citing the same reason. In fairness, the All Market index does appear to have gone up a bit since 2008, and tech stocks seem to be doing rather well. What do you think? Is this reflective of the AI revolution or just another dot.com bubble? I recon, differently from flickr, meebo, wikiyou, mahalo and bebo Apple, Google and Amazon have a thing called revenue. Of course post-COVID money printing has helped the equity valuations, but now that the money is printed and can’t be inflated away (not without a change in government both here and across the pond, it appears) then it must be here to stay in the form of capital… but does that explain all of the gains? And if not, then is the rest of it irrational exuberance? And if so, then how much? and if it’s a lot, what should I do about it? And should I really be paying out good old Warren for managing a money market fund? I hate timing the market, mainly because I’m very bad at it. The only time I called it right was March 2020 (buy! buy it now!), and even then I was hobbled by insufficient cash to “clean up”, as the kids these days call it. Thoughts? Overall seems a fair budget and personally I’m happy with the IHT changes. I wonder if the IHT change could have a big impact on some people? An unmarried / not in a civil partnership couple in a reasonable sized home and savings would likely have managed to keep under the IHT threshold. But with pensions now included this could easily push people over the limit meaning getting married / entering a civil partnership could be a useful tax planning option / investment to consider for anyone now impacted. On the AI discussion – I’m a big user of ChatGPT for work and personal – it’s useful to check details with – although it’s not perfect so it pays to check. A recent example was seeing which broker was cheapest following @TA’s recent article. I put the details noted in TA’s article (portfolio amount, monthly trades, etc) into ChatGPT, asked it to check a range of brokers, and it did all the leg work. > ChatGPT Is there a decent guide written by man or machine in how to use this and for what sort of queries? Whenever I go anywhere near it the answers fall into Pauli’s ‘so bad it’s not even wrong’ category. It lies to me with impunity and is delusional enough to appear permanently on acid. @all — Really great discussion, loving the range of thoughtful view. Cheers! @ermine — Me and @TA both thought this was very good: https://www.profgalloway.com/what-does-ai-think/ Hope it’s helpful. I’d say don’t treat it as the font of perfect knowledge. (We’ll really be screwed if/when it is or we can’t fool it at least, anyway 😉 ) More as I said like a knowledgeable but forgetful and maybe a bit braggardy/bluffery friend. I’ve emailed you by the way to the SLIS address about another matter. I feel this Govts further rise to CGT is massive – 8% more on lower rate and 4% on higher rate and this was after the recent Tory rises in reducing the annual exempt allowance from £12300 down to the now pitiful £3000 which was huge enough in itself. “Squeeze you until the pips squeak” comes to mind. Wouldn’t mind quite so much if Tories/Labour ever used it wisely/efficiently and things actually improved – but do they ever actually – not in my experience just more waste/fraud/inefficiency/incompetence/corruption/expenses scandals and the like. A plague on both your houses!! Some of us do have GIA investments and try to live from them – this is now much harder – as well as all the more CG tax returns being a right old PITA. Can now hardly divest anything much without incurring big tax bill. I use my annual ISA subscription but not working now so can’t use pension tax shelter – except the minimum allowed, which again is a pittance. It may be gains but we already pay tax on the original investment on earned income and then there’s inflation which is not accounted for reducing it more, particularly over recent years. What are they trying to do – stop us investing altogether? So when you need to sell most years for your income/living expenses and even to do Bed&Isa/small amount for SIPP – it’s a disaster pretty much all round. We’ve really got a choice of either not selling/letting gains build up even more (or maybe just sell a pitiful amount to diffuse your annual £3k which isn’t gonna make much difference) and taking from say, Isa accounts in the meantime and hoping tax rates are reduced in not too distant future but probably won’t happen anytime soon (and then can’t use your ISA allowance each year either) or sell and pay these punative tax rates to fill Isas and extract living expenses. Seems it will hit those harder who aren’t/can’t work who need to extract regularly. With regard to Bed & ISA though since the budget, Vanguard’s recent budget article discussed the merits of still doing this/taking the tax hit versus doing nothing. I suppose many will have seen this already but Vanguard say: “We calculated the potential increase in returns that a higher-rate taxpayer could realise by using bed and ISA every year, based on the new CGT rate of 24%. In our hypothetical example, the investor starts off with both a general account and an ISA, valued at £100,000 each. They invest in a portfolio which returns 5% a year after costs and then sell the investments after 10 years, paying CGT due on the remaining general account balance. The chart below shows the difference it would make if they depleted their general account over five years (by moving £20,000 a year into their ISA) compared with doing nothing. By diligently making the most of bed and ISA, the individual ends up with £15,304 more, despite holding exactly the same investments.” This is the article and this is discussed under the heading “What else can I do to reduce my CGT bill?”: https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/articles/latest-thoughts/markets-economy/what-the-autumn-statement-means-for-you?cmpgn=ET1024UKTLABU0101EN&guid=&nuid= At least they say that we’re generally better off to still do Bed & ISA and take the tax hit as then protected from taxes in future years – maybe until they next meddle. @TI (various posts) Normally I would say just delete BBlimp, however, you name checked him in your post so he had the right to reply. The second best thing is to ignore his ignorance. @Plague Dr Another reason it may be worth eating the hit w CGT steadily as your capgain seems to add to your income for that year as far as defining your tax bracket. In many ways Hunt’s original drop of the allowance from 12k p.a. was more significant for me, but the details will vary with the individual situation. Feels strange to think of reversing the old advice to keep income investments in the ISA to booting them out into the GIA and shifting capital growth stuff into the ISA to take their place @TI ta – at least it diagnosed my usage error. I am not particularly collegiate in problem solving. My mother got my primary school headmaster to take ‘is a lone wolf’ out of my valedictory report. He was right… So I may struggle to use it as thought partner. But it’s good to know the source of the fail. I was/am that nail basher with a screwdriver, my bad 😉 @Mack: “gifting the family home …”: be sure to get professional advice on how to do it in such a way that you retain your Residential Nil Rate Band versus IHT. “the risk of not surviving the seven years, etc.”: you can buy insurance that would give your beneficiaries enough cash to pay the estate’s IHT if you snuff it early. Professional advice could help you ensure that the insurance pay out was not part of your estate. I’ve been looking around the web for useful suggestions for fruitful ways of avoiding IHT on our (modest) SIPPs. So far: (i) Withdraw our TFLSs over three tax years and gift the money as surplus income – that way those gifts are IHT-free on despatch and income-tax-free on receipt. (ii) Instruct that each SIPP go to the other on death – no IHT to pay on first death. (iii) Expect to use the surviving capital to buy an Immediate Needs Annuity to help with the cost of “care”; if the annuity is paid direct to the care provider the payment incurs no income tax. (iv) Since the SIPPs are indeed modest, and 75% of them will be even more modest, the survivor of us will probably need to buy a further INA using money from ISAs. So be it. Maybe we won’t need the survivor to buy care but family medical history suggests otherwise. @Naeclue (#52) – Thanks! Your charity donations idea is interesting. It doesn’t suit me though as I have no GIA just SIPPs and ISAs. My plan so far is to make large withdrawals and gift surpluses, as you mentioned you will do too after you drawdown all your GIAs. I think it’s not an awful budget, although could have been better. The increase in employer NIC will hit hard on medium enterprises with tight profit margins. But for businesses with decent margins, there would be scope to carry that extra cost without choosing to hit pay or recruitment by eating into the margin a little, and let’s not pretend that it won’t be a choice if the business prefers to protect the profit margin. Personally I’ll be affected by IHT on pensions, and as I’m contemplating buying a second property the stamp duty increase. On pensions I think taking it into IHT makes sense (doesn’t hit the person who built up the funds, tax free on both money in and investment return let’s not forget, and only affects their heirs if the joint estate exceeds £1m). Less comfortable about the double tax potential if you die after age 75: if the fund bears IHT why would beneficiaries also have to pay income tax? They would not on other assets in the estate such as isa funds. There are also some points such as death in service sums from a workplace scheme that ought not to be subject to IHT. I’m not sure if they were intended to be caught (the consultation paper implies they will ) . @Xeny (#29) – It is not a comparison. It is just an observation of how they performed so far with almost no help from us. It’s also an optimistic hope that this will carry on 🙂 @Nebilon Less comfortable about the double tax potential if you die after age 75: if the fund bears IHT why would beneficiaries also have to pay income tax? They would not on other assets in the estate such as isa funds. I guess the rationale is that the pension sum was accrued from pre-tax income whereas other assets, including ISAs, are created/purchased from post-tax income. So, by treating it as beneficiaries’ taxable income transforms it into a post-tax amount in the same way that the original pension owner drawing down would have done. @dearieme (70 iii & iv) I don’t think you can use SIPP capital to buy an Immediate Needs Annuity – except of course by withdrawing the capital and paying the presumably large tax bill first. Thank you @Naeclue, your thoughts in post #52 are very useful. @Bob #16 said: “>But what was amusing was the Daily Mail publishing two or three articles a day in the run up with panicking suggestions to take pensions now and get the maximum commutation before the evil Chancellor reduced it. >The day after the DM headlines were that people who did this were tricked by the same evil Chancellor who caused the panic” Made me laugh too. Had she said anything to try to calm the panic down, she would probably also have been blamed by them for leaking budget details in advance. (I think I am getting old and cynical.) @dearieme (70) Re my comment at #75, I’ve just realised that you are only contemplating purchase of the INA after inheritance of the SIPP proceeds tax-free by the survivor. Scanning the comments above – I think possibly the ‘ease’ some of you find opening and managing sipps and ISAs and hammering down every little bit of cost may be leading you to believe continuing to go it alone without advice in retirement and death planning is for the best. Might even be you could get one off advice for specific circs if insistent on not getting ongoing advice. I would have thought, in most cases, as we’re talking about in the main £1million (or at the very least £325k) surely there’s scope for an advisor to add value. @Plague – forgive me for asking but did you max out Tessa/Pep/Isa/ pension allowances on the way up ? Interesting set of comments both good and bad. My overall impression for me is of a frog being slowly boiled. @Matt, the left are pro-Brexit, seeing the EU as a capitalist enterprise against the interests of workers. Being anti-Brexit is mostly about arithmetic. I was surprised after all the kite flying the budget was as reasonable as it was . It will hit me when (if ) my employer sells and my stake is realised by another 4% but that’s about it and that’s 4% of something I’ve never had so I can’t really complain and I still get to keep 76% of it .the pension being included in IHT wasn’t unexpected and is also fair I believe thoughi think the iht limit should be higher (but that’s not borne out by the reality of the countries demographics as shown below) . As another commentator has said if you’re affairs are simple with isas pensions one property no kids At private school then it can be summed up as ‘move along nothing to see here other than some iht planning’ . Fvlondons article also seems to bear this out. It’ll barely make a dent for him and he’s far further up the wealth bracket . Also on topic of the country being poor with a few rich people, I took a Telegraph test last night (don’t judge it was a free trial) and with a net worth of £1.2m I’m apparently in the top 2% of the country. Their sources for the data do seem accurate and if so that seems to bear this out (bear in mind that’s across all age brackets and I’m only in my 40’s so the majority of millionaires are likely to be in their 60’s) . That staggers though doesn’t surprise me .there’s definitely a skew in people’s perception of how wealthy they are (as evidenced by a client of mine with a net worth almost into 8 figures bemoaning Labour coming after the ‘middle classes’) I wish I was middle class ! But if I’m barely affected as one of the 2% then has the budget really fallen on those with the broadest shoulders? Having run around the Internet……… Pensions are for pensions only The potential £200000 IHT hit with the new regime is one for the kids to deal with -if it arises-carehome fees? Small house(£200000) – with rest of investments in stocks,bonds and cash-easily realisable for IHT bills Kids all financially independent and will get still something quite reasonable as an inheritance Not going to alter my financial setup at this late stage which is simple and easy for a 78 year old codger like me(and my executors) Keeping calm and carrying on! xxd09 I am genuinely interested, to those who say extra taxes and higher spending will just be wasted, how do you propose we fix the problems of: overflowing prisons, crumbling schools, and an ageing population (to name just 3). Is it just better allocation of resources in which case, where do you take the resources from? Presumably you also want to increase defence spending to 2.5 or 3%, so where’s that money going to come from? As far as I can tell we’ve tried austerity for the last 14 years, we’ve tried cutting back on spending and making efficiency savings everywhere, and what has that achieved? It hasn’t exactly turned the country into a beautiful utopia, quite the opposite in fact. Hmm. No kids, so while nieces/nephews will get mostly everything they’ve been whammied (hopefully a long time in the future). That said if I have to pay tax I’d rather it be when I’m dead and the treatment did seem unduly generous. If some future government brings us some unforseen economic success then maybe they’ll actually increase IHT thresholds to stop many more estates being dragged in as this change will prompt. Guess I can always draw and gift sometime in my 70s when I have a better idea of where I stand potwise vs the grim reaper. If anything it’s probably strengthened my resolve to RE. Far better return from the portfolio if I spend it than it gets sucked up by a potential 64% tax hit when my beneficiaries inherit (assuming they are HRT workers when they inherit the SIPP). @wephway, your ability to follow what is going on is hampered by your dogma, but police/courts/prisons got a 2pc cut. How’s that fit with your comment above? Labour are taxing and borrowing more, and spending less on some public services. What are they spending more on ? State pensions and the NHS It’s because NHS spending per capita has risen by 2pc in real terms every year since 2014 on average but produce worse outcomes that people are fed up with it. The only people that are pro NHS now have private health insurance, the virtue signalling classes who happy for people to lie on the floor for 16 hours waiting for an ambulance as long as they can signal how they love ‘our’ NHS. How is it Australia, France, Canada, Germany all get better health outcomes for similar spend ? The NHS will continue to suck money out of all the other public services and produce similar outcomes – why should the next 14 years be any different to the last ? – so we’ll be stuck in a crazy world where tax can be at highest it’s ever been yet you think there is austerity. @xxd – I think in many ways you’ve absolutely nailed life – had kids now grown up and don’t want to spend any more money (which has to be a workable definition of rich). Personally I still think you should get advice, see if anything can be done. Let’s face it, you can afford it. Looking back do you wish you’d spent more in different parts of your life ? Like on family holidays or childcare or anything ? @BBlimp Please back up your assertions on NHS spending, and per capita healthcare spending comparison with other countries with data from a reliable source. Even if real terms spending had gone up, that would be appropriate given increased demand (medicine changes all the time, what can be done done for patients with a given disease increases the bill as do other population factors). @Fatbritabroad, I think it worth considering the breakdown of the tax increases across those who are financially independent, that might be the top 2%, might be a bit more, I don’t really know. People who (at least) own their own their home outright and have sufficient pensions and investment income to cover their lifestyle. There is a huge range in wealth across this FI group, but it looks to me as though the increase in tax has not been put on those with the “broadest shoulders”. The IHT to pay on pensions is a rounding error to billionaires, as is the freeze on tax thresholds. Billionaires without farms have been asked to pay more CGT, but this is easily avoided by not crystallising gains. Income tax on dividends has not gone up, the capital gain to the date of death is still not taxed, Rate of IHT is unchanged and taxation of Trusts is unchanged. Ok, those with farms will be hit for IHT, but only at 20% and there will be 10 years to pay that. Why not have 20% over £1m and 40% over say £10m? No it looks to me as though it is the lower end of the FIs that have taken the biggest knocks. @Alex, or should I call you jr dr Alex ? https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/insight-and-analysis/data-and-charts/nhs-budget-nutshell https://www.statista.com/statistics/283221/per-capita-health-expenditure-by-country/ Yes it is shocking. @xxd – almost loathe to mention this, but there may be scope to upgrade to a bigger house, to maximise the residential allowance (assuming you’re married or in a civil partnership and no other factors at play). @FatBritabroad “Also on topic of the country being poor with a few rich people, I took a Telegraph test last night (don’t judge it was a free trial) and with a net worth of £1.2m I’m apparently in the top 2% of the country.” Not sure on what basis the Torygraph calculates this. The most reliable source of UK wealth data is the ONS Wealth and Assets Survey which calculates wealth on a household basis. Their last release was 2018-20 data (they are struggling with low resources but have told me they plan to release the 2020-22 dataset by the New Year). This is now out-of-date but at that time 13% of UK households had a net worth (including pensions and property) in excess of £1.2 million. The percentage will be significantly higher now due to inflation and asset appreciation. So even if the Torygraph was trying to measure on an individual (rather than a household) basis, the 2% figure they have given you seems likely to be wrong. Might help explain why the Chancellor’s targeting of those with the broadest shoulders didn’t affect you! @TI not allowing my response to Alex makes it look like I’m unable to support my claim with evidence. Hopefully he can Google the result ??? https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/insight-and-analysis/data-and-charts/nhs-budget-nutshell Yes it is shocking. And no, don’t assume we’re happy to continue paying for it. @BBlimp there really is no need for personal attacks, I could say the same to you about ‘dogma’. So your answer is we’re spending too much on the NHS and state pensions? To some extent I agree regards state pensions, the triple lock in my view is unsustainable. However I suspect many (especially in the right wing press) would kick up a never ending stink if the triple lock got taken away, see the reaction from means testing winter fuel payments. The NHS is complex and I don’t pretend to know the answers there, so you may have a point. I agree some sort of reform is needed and something is going wrong as productivity appears to be falling. Having said that, with an ageing population I expect we will need to keep putting in real terms increases in spending on the NHS for the foreseeable. Whether that’s through some kind of insurance based system like France or Canada (I note you don’t mention the US), or by sticking with the NHS, spending is still going to keep going up. Regards a 2pct cut on police/prisons/courts, I haven’t seen that anywhere in the news, care to share where you heard that? @BBlimp — Your response is literally posted above and was at the time you wrote this. Your post went into auto-moderation because (a) it contained links and (b) your posts have been identified by the automatic spam checker as the sort of thing Russian bots etc post I suppose. Re: your earlier screed today about how ‘sad’ it was that I delete your comments about Brexit, while I’m here let me restate again. Your posts about Brexit add nothing to the site. You don’t bring any value except a ‘contrary’ view which is just standard right-wing talking points. I’ve revealed the ongoing Brexit damp squib-to-real damage over the years by the ongoing statistics. You and your two to three acolytes just talk about censorship and accuse somebody who reads more widely than any of you (see the range of views in the links above) of a blinkered world view. I moderate this site to keep the comment thread vibrant, in contrast to the unreadable threads elsewhere on the web. Over the years you’ve demonstrated you sit squarely towards the ‘troll’ end of the comment spectrum, for reasons I feel no compunction to go into here. I’d happily just delete you until you go away and probably should, but I’m soft-hearted and endlessly optimistic. Hope this helps. @wephway Day-to-day spending on NHS and education in England to rise by 4.7% in real terms this year, before smaller rises next year Defence spending to rise by £2.9bn next year Home Office budget to shrink by 3.1% this year and 3.3% next year in real terms, due to assumed savings from asylum system £1.3bn extra funding next year for local councils, which will also keep all cash from Right to Buy sales from next month https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxl1zd07l1o.amp @tortoise, @alex I might be easy to dismiss – but when Wephway is questioning NHS productivity it’s time you guys realise the public has woken up to the fact the NHS is run poorly, for the benefit of the staff, and people are noticing. I think the title of the article sums it all up very well. Unsurprising in my view that the budget itself felt like a bit of a nothing burger, the angst in the build up was clearly overbought. As ever political philosophy will be a source of endless debate and conflict but from a purely practical personal investing POV the outcome was broadly a relief. The political debate doesn’t need stoking anymore but I can’t help but vent at the triumph of ideology over pragmatism that is private school VAT. No-one could question the idea of an equal education system and perfect meritocracy but that’s not what this achieves and the govnt’s hackneyed “State school parents have aspirations for their children too” is a cynical evasion of addressing the tangible outcome of the policy in practical terms. It is to educational equality what the British ISA was to a UK capital markets renaissance only this one hurts people. The destructive effects on the marginal private school family are clear, the potential for constructive benefits for a state school family when the second and third order impacts of families shifting sectors net out aren’t. Probably an unpopular opinion but the fact truly vast wealth (Grosvenor etc) can transcend generations via trusts and/or gifts entirely free of tax makes tighter IHT rules at least at the very top of the spectrum a more compelling place to look at progressive taxes to support state education @BBlimp “Home Office budget to shrink by 3.1% this year and 3.3% next year in real terms, due to assumed savings from asylum system” Still not seeing how you get from that to a 2pct cut to courts/prisons/police? Is there more detail somewhere about this, or what the ‘assumed savings’ are? @BBlimp – your statista link doesn’t say anything about outcomes but in terms of expenditure per capita it looks like Canada spends 15% more than the UK, France and Australia 18-20% more and Germany 45% more. On the reasons for health spending rising in real terms these are well known as @Alex says. @faustus thanks that makes more sense at that kind of level Their source is quoted as Household total wealth by percentiles: ONS – Household total wealth in Great Britain, March 2020, figures adjusted by Consumer Price Index; For those interested in a rigorous comparison of the NHS with other countries the kingsfund report linked at https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/insight-and-analysis/blogs/comparing-nhs-to-health-care-systems-other-countries might be worth a read. While the situation is no doubt far more complicated than any of us appreciate here, it would appear that underinvestment in staff (low in both doctors and nurses) and facilities (e.g., high bed occupancy rates – if only we had some new hospitals!) may very well contribute to poor health outcomes. The overwhelming of GP services (e.g., the city I live in has one of the worst patient to GP ratios in the country) probably doesn’t help with treating conditions that benefit from being diagnosed early. Hopefully, the increased investment in the NHS will at least begin to address some of the issues. ps. Part of the abstract in the main report reads as follows: “The UK has below-average health spending per person compared to peer countries. Health spending as a share of GDP (gross domestic product) was just below average in 2019 but rose to just above average in 2020 (the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, which of course had a significant impact on the UK’s economic performance and spending on health services). The UK lags behind other countries in its capital investment, and has substantially fewer key physical resources than many of its peers, including CT and MRI scanners and hospital beds. The UK has strikingly low levels of key clinical staff, including doctors and nurses, and is heavily reliant on foreign-trained staff. Remuneration for some clinical staff groups also appears to be less competitive in the UK than in peer countries.” BBlimp -don’t think I would do anything differently My wife had 10 years “off” till our third kid had gone to primary school-probably why the kids did so well! Very much our choice Only ever bought a small house so they can’t come back-suits a retired couple though! One daughter a GP -tells me practices don’t have enough cash to employ more GPs-they are too expensive Imagine the Tory party having a first generation immigrant Nigerian lady as leader-take the Labour Party a while to catch up with that one! Aren’t politicians and economies such fun -roll on Wednesday and the US elections xxd09 @FatBritabroad No problem. The Torygraph seems to be referencing the right source but not the correct figures (a legacy perhaps from their infamous columnist, A. B. de Pfeffel Johnson?). The actual ONS source referenced is linked here – see Figure 2 which breaks down Household Total Wealth in March 2020 by percentile: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/totalwealthingreatbritain/april2018tomarch2020 Even with the triple lock on pensions it still lower than most .imagine if that was taken.careful what you wish for with a little luck you will be in receipt one day.Although as readers here you may not care @BBlimp #79 Yes always maxxed tessa’s/peps/isas – used to have mixture of cash/S&S but nowadys just have S&S. But pensions not as much for couple of reasons. No workplace pension so no employer contributions and back when I started at 21 only old style personal pensions – no sipps or stakeholders then. One thing was no access to the funds until some much older age wasn’t an option when I would likely need it. Later on I also found many of these pensions to be a rip off with hidden/secretive/back door charges & commissions – even when I asked my pension advisor he never disclosed exactly what charges were being taken (except the AMC and usual stuff on the yearly pension review statement) but performance was poor. I was even recommended to this pension by an IFA in the first place – pretty much hopeless – and he took commission as well as was before fee based advice came in. Another pension I took out few years later was similar, so kinda put me off these pretty much. One of these advisors also recommended a couple of S&S isas. I expected a one off commission for the advice but wasn’t told of the ongoing trail commissions being taken every year until many years later the fund manager happened to mention it when I rang about something. No wonder they never really performed very well over many years. So no fan of financial advisors at all. Pensions nowadays – I no longer work, although still working age, due to medical conditions. Reviewed pensions and decided to transfer to DIY sipps and transferred S&S isas also to DIY platforms. Since then all have done much better – no comparison in my view. But now can only contribute the paltry maximum £2880 + T/R per annum to them which I do. Not much but get the 25% T/R on contributions and 25% TFLS when draw so better than a boot in the nuts. Agree with you on the NHS – although the whole country is in a complete mess – what exactly do they spend all the money on as nothing improves. The NHS is a black hole into which we pour our taxes and get diminishing returns/poor service and only ever seems to get worse. Complete reform is needed/maybe different model as this doesn’t work and neither have previous reforms from recent past. Have a lot of experience of NHS for myself and family since around 2003 and it has got much worse with many mistakes and unacceptable level of service from Gp’s & hospitals and very rude and abrubt staff. Have had to make complaints but these don’t lead anywhere – they ensure that. Family members even had a solicitor for a strong case of negligence where their mistakes very nearly caused a family member to die was it not for another family member intervening and having to be rushed back into emergency surgery. However they had to abandon the case as solicitors said the NHS would not provide information and had “closed ranks” to prevent it. Also one consultant said to me, in front of my parents, that “it may be better if my mother died as less of a burden for me” when she was only in a wheelchair due to osteo arthritis and also some mild memory problems. Could go on with many more including my own treatment which has been both useless and horrendous. But Dr’s/nurses/GP’s still seem to demand more/strike half the time for a joke of a service. Some even state they have to use foodbanks when I know people on the minimum wage who manage without quite okay – they shouldn’t even be allowed near a foodbank – what exactly do they do with their money? I think most earn enough – and many earn far more than they are ever worth in my experience. @BBlimp. How can day to day spending go up that much within a year other than boosting salaries? How many years and other efforts) will be needed to turn available cash into additional trained staff, buildings or equipment ? Can it really go anywhere other than public sector pay rises? If it does, it isn’t available for investment downstream. It could have been used to help tackle the deficit but nope borrowing uis on the up too. I think commentary on this budget has been a bit ingenuous, it’s priority looks more like boosting public sector pay. We have had a good plucking justified by just stated intentions but without justification and no clarification of quantified objectives or planned routes. I don’t understand how anyone can applaud this budget given the vacuum of tangible plans. Give me the money now and I’ll tell you what you have bought next year. @BBlimp #79 > may be leading you to believe continuing to go it alone without advice in retirement and death planning is for the best There’s not much that I agree with BBlimp on but this is one thing I wholeheartedly do agree on, particularly if there are concerns about care. Some of the products for care provision, such as a purchased life annuity are only available through IFAs, because the providers don’t want the hassle of compliance and mis-selling liability. It is the job of the IFA to take this risk off them. Search for an IFA that is part of SOLLA. One of these served my late mother very well. Sure, the PLA was in hindsight a misallocation of capital, though not terribly, but it was the right way to go because of the floor it put under the risk. @DavidV: thank you for your two remarks. One financial comments thread told me that you can buy an Immediate Needs Annuity with cash inside a SIPP – but if the commenter was wrong, he was wrong. Monevator used to carry occasional pieces by a financial advisor – Mark Meldon – who seemed to have a really useful grasp on insurance, annuities, and so on but I’ve not seen a piece by him in ages. Maybe I should look through the archives. As you inferred our likeliest outcome is that I’ll die first, my SIPP will go to my widow and she might later use it for an INA – assuming that that never becomes seen as an evil loophole in desperate need of plugging. Meantime we have started a logical response to the budget – for the first time in donkey’s we went out for a decent lunch at the weekend. Then we bought two new mattresses. Then I started to investigate sources of aged Aussie Rieslings. Ooh, the high life, eh? @BBlimp Feel free to call me Alex. You can call me doctor if you’re feeling particularly deferential, but I’m not a junior doctor. It looks like others have pointed out that one of your links does not back up your assertions. Allow me to give an example that might help to explain why the NHS is something of a bottomless pit. Maybe ten years ago, probably less, if you got endometrial cancer you would have biopsy, the cancer would be diagnosed in a lab, then you would have your surgery. The lab would stage the cancer and that would determine whether you needed further treatment (chemotherapy or radiotherapy). Today, the lab would do two additional tests on your biopsy. Possibly a third depending on the results. And you might even get referred for genetic counselling and further testing for a cancer syndrome depending on the results of the third test. You’ll probably have an MRI scan before your surgery. All these results would be used to decide whether you’ll need more involved surgery (such as sentinel lymph node biopsy). Once the lab have staged the tumour (now a more involved process with more data points to report) you might get chemotherapy, radiotherapy, a new targeted therapy (expensive). Oh, and if you turn out to have that cancer syndrome, you’ll be offered additional care (such as screening for bowel cancer) and the invitation for genetic testing may be extended to your family members too. Imagine the additional resources required for all this and then add all the other changes to medical care in the last 10 years and marvel that the NHS has managed what it has. Measuring productivity as targets met or appointments offered or whatever is inevitably flawed. I don’t know where we’ll end up. Maybe the taxpayer will decide that we don’t want to pay for state of the art care for everything and we’ll have to decide what to ration. Personally I think it would be a moral tragedy if we end up with anything remotely resembling US health care, although I’d certainly be better off financially. On the subject of protecting the natural world and the value of biodiversity, I highly recommend Silent Earth by Dave Goulsen. And finally, I shall leave you with a personal anecdote. When my brother took my ranty, bigoted, brexiteer father on holiday to Greece, he banned the Daily Mail. My father stopped baiting him on subjects like race or the environment etc and went back to being the lovely man we all knew he really was. Well, for a couple of weeks at least. I do believe he was happier in himself for those two weeks too. Food for thought… It’s disappointing that there seems to be little similarity between the statements from Labour politicians before the election and the new government’s actions since, including the recent budget. Apparently Rachel Reeves said a few days ago that the budget would be a one-off “This is not the sort of Budget we would want to repeat” (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c86q31wlj39o). However the weekend reading linked IFS article suggests the chancellor will increase taxes further as have other commentators e.g. Ros Altmann. Does anyone believe the chancellor will not raise taxes more in the next few years? Worth noting I think that pensions-into-IHT will change the consideration on how to balance SIPP, GIA or ISA, especially for families. For SIPPs the input tax relief could be at lower rate but now there’s more chance of higher rate out. With ISAs money can be gifted under the current rules whenever makes sense without a potential tax uplift. Secondly, going after land billionaires is one thing but 20% IHT on smaller farms is a terrible idea. The yields on small farming aren’t high enough and will force changes on less well off rural communities. We should be encouraging small local producers! Lastly, largely removing entrepreneurs relief or BADR is going the wrong way if you want to encourage more high growth start ups. @dearieme (#71 #109), @DavidV (#76 #78), and others – thank you for your thoughts on possibly gifting the family home earlier to reduce IHT now that pensions are to be brought into the IHT net. I need to revisit Mark Meldon’s guest articles. I need to give this all more thought, draw the decision tree, consider probabilities, and once I have the basics, seek professional advice. Regarding the discussions on wealth, I noticed in the Budget Report that the proposed pension changes are expected to impact fewer estates than I had anticipated: “The government is also removing the opportunity for individuals to use pensions as a vehicle for inheritance tax planning by bringing unspent pots into the scope of inheritance tax from April 2027, which will affect around 8% of estates each year.” On reflection, this might be the point where I stop repeatedly doing ‘one more year’ and start spending more time walking in the Lake District! @Naeclue (#52): Interesting approach – but will registered charities not now be the biggest beneficiaries (as opposed to your relatives)? AIUI “gifts from income” (vs PETs) have to be from income and cannot be from capital (i.e. selling down investments) – do DC pensions qualify? Furthermore, as the exemption is only claimed (and possibly tested) on death it must be fully evidenced as you go along, and it is not unheard of for the rules to change en route to the planned destination. @Nebilon (#73): Good spot re DB’s (“workplace schemes”). Perhaps, as you surmise, they are typos? @Calculus (#112) While I might be wrong (I’m no tax expert), my understanding is that there is £1m of IHT agricultural relief for farms on top of the (potentially) £1m nil-rate band so farms worth up to £2m will be IHT free. Given that shares in the business (or land) can be gifted beforehand, then tax planning ought to be able to minimise IHT. @Al Cam, the charities were going to receive the ETFs anyway. All that has changed is that we will be drawing more from our SIPPs than we had previously intended and passing this to nieces and nephews. Previously relatives were to receive the SIPPs after we died. This will not completely mitigate the IHT on our SIPPs as we will not draw to zero. Having ISAs as the sole tax advantaged accounts is risky as ISAs may be targeted in future budgets. Payments from pensions are counted as income for the “gifts from income” perspective (https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/inheritance-tax-manual/ihtm14250). I don’t believe that is the case with ISAs where I believe cash from disposals would not count as income, but I have yet to find definitive statements to that effect from HMRC. ps Hopefully we will live longer than 7 years after the gifts in any case! Is anyone here using trusts as an IHT management strategy? I’m thinking this may be up Finimus’ street. A solicitor was telling me about the trade offs between 6% every decade and 40% on death, putting 325k in every 7 years, granting yourself 0% loans and things like that. Wondered if anyone here was actually doing any of this stuff? @Rhino I did look into Trusts years ago, but concluded they were not for us. Yes, there is a potential IHT saving, but Trusts are not tax shelters. You have to pay full additional rate tax on income and gains. Beneficiaries can subsequently claim back tax if taxed at lower marginal rates. Then there is the cost of running the Trusts. These can be minimised by buying off the shelf Trusts from insurance companies, but when I looked the choice of investments was poor (no cheap tracker funds). I concluded that it was better to simply gift money to the kids to put into their own ISAs, SIPPs and property. This does mean having to trust that your kids will be sensible with money early on in life! If you don’t then Trusts may be worth considering. ps Trusts may be another sitting duck for hard up chancellors. I was surprised the IHT rate was held at 6%. @Naeclue: Thanks for the reply. I too am pretty sure that this budget is only the beginning – so little if any point in optimising vs the latest situation. I had read that part of the HMRC manual, but other writers have used income from DB pensions – hence my Q, see e.g.: https://www.theprivateoffice.com/insights/gifting-surplus-income IIRC yet other writers have mentioned ISA’s as being acceptable – but as they do not appear in tax returns they require special/additional evidencing. Having said that, ISA acceptability may only extend to cash ISA’s as opposed to S&S ISA’s – for exactly the same reasons [capital vs income] as I have a query re DC pensions. Totally agree re the 7 years – which of course might change too. Re not emptying the SIPPs – I suspect judging how far to run them down will be a tricky calculation, and FWIW, will inevitably adversely effect your withdrawal rate too. Might all of the above even change the calculus re [fixed term?] annuities? My prediction for RR’s phase 2 is: 1 ISA cap of £500k – anything above hopefully can stay but no new subs. 2 Merging income tax and NI – so the basics rate becomes 27.5%. 3 All pensions savings to become “net of tax” + 50% The NI will Hurt pensioners, but that’s where the money is for non-workers. It would cost me a fair bit , but feels semi-rational when all’s said and done @dearieme #109 Yes, having noticed his absence, seemingly since the worst Covid time, I’ve occasionally wondered about Mark Meldon. He was honest about his being a smoker and, hoping very much that I was wrong, I’ve found myself putting two and two together. @dearieme, Factor Mark Meldon appears to be in business still: https://meldonandco.uk/our-people/ A quick look on Companies House shows the company is active (last submitted accounts for year ending 31 March 2024): https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/01797503 #120 Blimey that’s cheery. There has to ultimately be a limit on what taxes can be applied to those not in employment to generate any sense of stability in older age. Politically as well as practically. I’m not sure it’s in anyone’s long term interests to encourage individuals into a “spend, spend, spend” mentality then fall back on the state. I think caps on tax advantaged vehicles seem a reasonable proposition but provided the cap is determined appropriately. The issue with the old LTA (and the LSA) is that a sum of £1m in a SIPP/DC doesn’t really represent a mega amount in annual annuity income (recently saw about £45k in Single life with 3% escalation at age 60). Yet without getting at the “prudent” middle the rump of the meat isn’t there. An ISA contribution cap at £500k doesn’t really mean much more tax generated I suspect. “I noticed in the Budget Report that the proposed pension changes are expected to impact fewer estates than I had anticipated”: ah, but remember that the estate of the first of a couple to die will be free of IHT if passed to the widow. So it’s only the widow’s estate that will be pillaged. The incidence of the tax, though, falls not on the widow but on her beneficiaries who might vary in number from 1 to N . So the number of individuals affected might be pretty large: some will doubtless be toddlers who will thus pay tax at 40% IHT plus whatever income tax bracket they’ll land in when the pension money arrives. Should I write to Kemi and suggest she call it “Two-Tier’s Toddler Tax”? Tempting. A great budget! But Labour must go further… we need: – Scrap tuition fees – only have degree apprenticeships going forward. Make employers pay for all higher education. – Tax homeowners (i.e. 10% CGT on sale of primary residences, 50% CGT on second properties). – Add more council tax bands (with no cap). – A new 50% income tax rate for earners of £250K+ – All flights to be taxed at an extra £50-£100 per person per flight (£50 short-haul, £100 long-haul). – Fuel duty increase of 5p per litre (with haulage to pay 2X this rate). – Double VAT on unhealthy foods: sugar, UPFs, fizzy drinks etc. – Tax social media usage at 1p/min, and 1p per text/msg/email. – Ban phones and social media for anyone medically diagnosed with any mental illness (e.g. ADHD, anxiety, depression etc). – Part-privatize the NHS (make medical insurance compulsory). – All public sector pensions to end, transfer everyone to private DC pensions. – Benefits to be cut by 1% pa until everyone is working (create compulsory jobs as required). Illegal immigration will end if there are no benefits. – End cash payment (CBDCs will mean criminals have no way of getting paid). This would fix the deficit, allow a budget surplus, remove most health problems and crime. Labour needs to do this asap. I do wonder whether there will be a material switch from designating children as beneficiaries of a SIPP* to get the IHT skipped early and possibly a pre 75 benefit to ensuring everything goes to spouse and inflating overall estate on a kick the can down the road basis. In perhaps a vain hope that IHT is eventually lowered/granted higher thresholds. *certainly something I’ve been advising friends to think about if they already have tasty DBs or a spouse with their own decent SIPP. Maybe not widespread. @Curlew @Dearieme @Factor — I have asked Mark to write for us again over the years but I got the impression he felt he’d scratched that issue. Perhaps I’ll drop him a line again. I agree that his pieces added another dimension to the site! @Alan S (115) Thanks, the £2m level would still catch many farms in this part of the world that don’t make huge income, and gifting seems a fair mitigation strategy. One wonders if the 7 year rule and lack of gift cap are next on the block. @Alan S @Calculus — See the Dan Neidel X thread I linked to above in the Saturday links. He reckons the threat to small family farms is overblown. @Calculus, I don’t know much about the taxation of farmland, but normally if you give something away you have to pay capital gains tax on the increase in value of the gift. If this applies to farmland that may make gifting difficult. CGT is not applied on death and the value of an asset is uplifted to the value at death. As there was no IHT to pay on farmland and no CGT on death, passing farmland on death may well have been more tax efficient than gifting before death. I met a farmer on Sunday night. He is of course livid. Judging by the amount of time he spends on his yacht he is clearly retired or mostly retired but still owns the farm. He did tell me that his kids have their own careers and have no interest in taking over his farm, so they would probably sell after he has gone anyway. Maybe there should have been some difference in taxation between those inheriting and subsequently running a family farm and those cashing in. I wonder whether the issue that has arisen with farming is the growth in price of the land. This has grown out of all proportion to the income that can be achieved from farming. From what I have heard some farmers say farming doesn’t seem to make much business sense. I wonder whether part of that reason was the IHT break on farming. Without that maybe land prices will fall such that yields from farming make more sense. The problem with tax incentives is that they are open to abuse. The ability to pass on pension funds free of IHT was clearly distorting pensions. I know this because I reacted to the ability to avoid IHT via pensions. AIUI, a similar thing has happened with farms. People buying in to avoid IHT. A £1 million pension buys you an annuity much lower than the average wage. A £3 million sheep farm will give you an income of ~£16K pa in Wales (half the average wage, and much lower than minimum wage). You would need to earn £50K-£70K to have the same standard of living as a family on benefits. ASSETS ARE TAXED TOO HIGHLY. THERE NEEDS TO BE A £5 million THRESHOLD ON ASSETS BEFORE ANY TAX! (Also tax ALL benefits!!!) @BBB #123 The ISA change is needed not to increase tax take today, but to ensure the future revenue stream (lost) isn’t too significant. An argument could easily be make for a much lower limit. Taking my (hopefully near future) position of around £50k pension and other income PLUS 2x£500k isa giving off 5% income – so £100k pa and £7500 tax £0 NI, Compare that to a worker earning £100k with no ISA. – roughly it’s £27k tax, £4K NI (£14k employers NI on new basis). £7.5k v £31k (or £45k inc ENI ) I’m on the right side of the fence but this is not justifiable nor reasonable. So after writing this we need merged tax and NI, and ISA limit of £200k (that doubles the state pension with no tax) #125+1 we need change and the govt needs teeth, and to use them @Simon West — Please don’t shout in CAPS on our site, cheers! The market is loving the Trump win, and the market is always right! @Boltt #132 As accumulators I wonder whether we place too much emphasis on what a good deal ISAs are. They are obviously but how many people in their earning years are fully using the £20k on top of fully funding pensions? I will have a retirement project to convert GIA to ISA (at an 18% hit) and that GIA will inflate with any TFLS I take to try to head off any future potential pension tax changes (tax at 18/24 beats tax in SIPP at 20/40 on growth anyway once LSA has been passed). Guess I just have to get used to the idea that I will be facing at least 20% tax plus the NI whammy if it happens. @TI Im not subscribed to X for the Niedel thread – if the argument is there’s ‘only’ 500 farms affected for 22/23 – thats the figure, but its out of the 1700 or so reporting for estate relief for that year. So about 30% of all farms (and rising) , not overblown ~(check out the defra survey on farm assets and net worths). https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/balance-sheet-analysis-and-farming-performance-england/balance-sheet-analysis-and-farming-performance-england-202223-statistics-notice#net-worth @Naeclue – if people are buying into farmland solely to avoid IHT at least at the smaller end, good luck – its a poor yielding asset that needs a lot of maintenance and holds a fair level of risk!

Title: Tesla, AMD And Nvidia Show Higher Volatility Than Bitcoin In October 2024

Time Published: 2024-11-02T08:25:19Z
Full Content:
October 2024 data shows major tech stocks exceeded bitcoin's 11% volatility, with Tesla reaching ... [+] 24%, AMD 16%, and Nvidia 12%. Tesla stock topped the volatility charts at 24%, followed by AMD at 16% and Nvidia at 12%, all surpassing bitcoin's 11% movement range, according to my calculations. Other tech giants showed lower volatility than bitcoin. Intel registered 9% price swings, while Meta and Microsoft stayed around 8%. Amazon showed 7% volatility, with Google at 6%. Apple proved the most stable among analyzed stocks with just under 6% monthly volatility. This volatility distribution suggests the conventional financial narrative may need updating, as the data no longer supports the assumption that bitcoin is significantly more volatile than blue-chip tech stocks. Notably, Tesla's 24% volatility more than doubled bitcoin's 11% movement range in October 2024. Tesla, AMD, and Nvidia exhibited higher volatility than bitcoin in October 2024, while Intel, Meta, ... [+] Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Apple showed more stable price movements. Looking at maximum daily price movements, Tesla recorded the highest single-day gain at +21.92% and AMD showed the steepest drop at -10.62%, both far exceeding bitcoin's relatively modest range of +5.11% to -3.95%. Most tech stocks showed asymmetric movements with larger drops than gains, while Tesla stood out with its gain being more than twice its largest decline of -8.78%. Methodology: To test bitcoin's volatility against traditional markets, I analyzed major tech stocks with high trading volumes and media attention. I measured price swings using daily logarithmic returns in October 2024, computing their standard deviation as monthly volatility percentage. All price data was sourced from Investing.com. The October data showing bitcoin as more stable than some major tech stocks extends its long-term trend toward price stability. This shift can be attributed to several key market factors. "What we're witnessing now is bitcoin maturing as an asset, with large, stable holders and significant institutional buy-in," Mike Ermolaev, founder of Outset PR, said in an email statement. "While bitcoin isn't immune to market forces, the volatility gap between it and high-growth tech stocks is telling: bitcoin is increasingly behaving like a less speculative asset," Ermolaev explained, pointing to bitcoin ETF inflows as evidence of institutional confidence in the cryptocurrency's stability. "There is more overlap in equity and crypto traders than most realize, and that brings more similar volatility," said Mike Cagney, CEO of Figure Markets in an email statement. "As we begin to migrate to venues that feature both equity and crypto that can be cross collateralized, the two will be more correlated," he added, pointing to the increasing market integration through platforms offering cross-collateralization between both asset types. "Bitcoin's unexpected stability in October might signal its emerging role as a modern safe-haven asset," Alan Orwick, Co-Founder at Quai Network, said in an email statement. "It might just be time to question where the real value lies in an inflationary future," Orwick noted, referencing an investor Paul Tudor Jones's recent suggestion that "all roads lead to inflation" due to the U.S.'s fiscal trajectory. "It's part of what makes emerging asset classes like crypto, and even stocks like Tesla, AMD, and Nvidia, so dynamic," Dr. Tonya M. Evans, Digital Money Expert at Penn State Dickinson Law, said in an email statement. "Just as traditional finance markets settled over time, bitcoin will likely follow suit as adoption continues to grow and expand," Evans noted, suggesting that volatility should be seen as "a sign of new opportunities in an evolving financial landscape for both traditional finance and emerging digital assets markets."
