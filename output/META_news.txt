Title: An $803-billion company most people have never heard of just knocked Tesla out of the Magnificent 7

With hardly anyone noticing, a tech titan you’ve probably never heard of has booted Tesla out of the heavily-hyped Magnificent Seven. Can it stay there? The overlooked Magnificent Seventh is Broadcom, a tech company that produces both hardware and software. It’s well known in the infotech world but unfamiliar beyond it. The Magnificent Seven, conceived as a group of stocks in early 2023, are the most valuable U.S. tech companies by market capitalization. In descending order they include Apple (recent market cap: $3.4 trillion), Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla (recent market cap: $768 billion). Yet Broadcom’s market cap slipped past Tesla’s last spring and has stayed ahead of the EV-maker for most of the year. Its market cap is currently around $803 billion. Broadcom is not guaranteed to stay ahead of Tesla, at least in the near term. Tesla’s stock is notoriously volatile, and its market cap could plausibly beat Broadcom’s for a time. But Broadcom’s long-term outlook is by far the sunnier of the two. Wall Street analysts on average expect its stock price to keep climbing, while they expect Tesla’s to continue to fall. Tesla’s stock has retreated to where it was almost four years ago, while Broadcom’s is up 290% since then. So how did this quiet giant sneak into the highest reaches of tech royalty? Mostly by a combination of tech savvy and financial acumen. The company is a grandchild of Hewlett-Packard, which in 1999 spun off a company called Agilent Technologies, which in turn spun off a company called Avago to a pair of private equity firms in 2005. Avago began buying up semiconductor firms, in 2015 buying a big one called Broadcom and taking its name. Broadcom’s PE ancestry has guided it ever since that spinoff. “Broadcom operates pretty much like a PE firm, where it invests in assets that can deliver quick returns,” says Naveen Chhabra, an analyst at the Forrester research and consulting firm. It’s “astute in terms of investing in firms where it can maintain or grow the revenue” and at the same time “can turn the company into a high margin business.” Exhibit A is Broadcom’s biggest acquisition, the cloud-computing firm VMware, which it bought last November. A Forrester report for VMware customers warns them, “Don’t let the price jumps shock you…. In most cases, customers will find the renewal quotes multiple times higher than what they paid in the past.” Wall Street approves of Broadcom’s changes. “They appear to be killing it on VMware,” says Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, “which markedly exceeded expectations in the quarter and which seems poised to continue growing.” Shrewd acquisitions and management are central to Broadcom’s growth but don’t fully explain the company’s phenomenally swelling market cap. The other crucial factor is, not surprisingly, the AI frenzy. One of Broadcom’s most important businesses is designing semiconductors—computer chips—and in the past year, demand has been sky high. Broadcom’s sales of AI chips in fiscal 2023 were $4.2 billion, BofA Securities reports. The firm expects AI chip sales will rocket to $12.1 billion this year and $16.9 billion next year. Broadcom’s chip expertise along with VMware’s success has propelled Broadcom’s market cap from just above that of McDonald’s when OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022, to Magnificent Seven levels today. A critical element of Broadcom’s success and its future is CEO Hock Tan, who was recruited to run the company when Avago was spun off in 2005. Now age 72, he was born in Malaysia and earned engineering degrees from MIT plus an MBA from the Harvard Business School. He has spent most of his career in tech companies, though he also held finance jobs at PepsiCo and General Motors—thus the company’s joint expertise in technology and finance. In recent years, Tan has been among the most highly paid U.S. CEOs; he made $162 million last year. Succession is an obvious issue for the company, but no successor is apparent. Tan has said he’ll continue to run the company for at least four more years. Wall Street analysts are mostly cheering for Broadcom. “Numbers look likely to keep going up,” says Bernstein’s Rasgon. “And valuation is looking increasingly attractive.” JP Morgan’s Harlan Sur says the stock “remains our top pick in semiconductors.” No tree grows to the sky, but for now the sun is shining brightly on this company. Beyond that, the only certainty is that Broadcom can’t be anonymous anymore. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Full Content:
Arista Networks , Inc. (NYSE:ANET) President and CEO Jayshree Ullal has sold a total of $323,264 worth of company stock, according to a recent SEC filing. The transactions, which took place on October 2, 2024, involved multiple sales at prices ranging from $381.82 to $389.6836 per share. Ullal, who also serves as a director of the company, executed the sales under a pre-established trading plan in accordance with Rule 10b5-1. This rule allows company insiders to set up a trading plan for selling stocks they own in a way that avoids accusations of insider trading. The plan was adopted on December 13, 2023. The series of sales included transactions of 10 shares at a price of $381.82, 164 shares at prices between $383.15 and $383.16, 109 shares at prices between $384.52 and $384.53, 155 shares at prices between $386.27 and $386.28, 298 shares at prices between $388.22 and $389.21, and 100 shares at prices between $389.23 and $389.83. In addition to the sales, Ullal also acquired 836 shares of common stock through the exercise of options at a price of $56.585, amounting to a total of $47,305. This transaction is part of a scheduled plan and shows the executive's ongoing investment in the company. Following these transactions, Ullal's direct holdings have changed, but she also has indirect ownership through trusts for family members, including her children and other relatives, where she shares voting and investment control but disclaims beneficial ownership. Investors often monitor insider buying and selling as it can provide insights into a company's internal perspective. The transactions by Arista Networks' CEO are part of routine financial planning and do not necessarily indicate a shift in company outlook. For further details on the transactions, investors can refer to the complete filing available on the SEC's website. In other recent news, Arista Networks has been making significant strides. The company reported a robust Q2 performance with revenues reaching $1.69 billion, indicating a 15.9% increase year-over-year, primarily driven by services and software support renewals. Goldman Sachs maintains a Buy rating on Arista Networks with a steady price target of $430.00, projecting the company to achieve approximately 20% revenue growth in 2024 and 2025. They also expect Arista to outperform in the third quarter of 2024, surpassing revenue and margin expectations. Evercore ISI maintained its Outperform rating for Arista, based on the potential revenue opportunity from Meta (NASDAQ:META)'s development of a massive new AI model training cluster. This could result in a possible $250 million in revenue for Arista if they secure the contract. Deutsche Bank also maintained its Hold rating on Arista, suggesting a positive outlook for the company's growth potential through 2025. In other developments, Arista Networks repurchased $172 million of its common stock and generated $989 million in operating cash. However, it's important to note that operating expenses increased to $319.8 million due to higher headcount and new product introduction costs. These recent developments highlight Arista Networks' strong market position and potential for continued growth. To provide additional context to Jayshree Ullal's recent stock transactions, it's worth examining some key financial metrics and insights from InvestingPro for Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET). As of the latest data, Arista Networks boasts a substantial market capitalization of $124.0 billion, reflecting its prominent position in the Communications Equipment industry. This aligns with one of the InvestingPro Tips, which highlights ANET as a "Prominent player in the Communications Equipment industry." The company's stock has shown remarkable performance, with a one-year price total return of 112.85% as of the most recent data. This impressive gain underscores another InvestingPro Tip noting a "High return over the last year." Additionally, the stock is currently trading near its 52-week high, with the price at 99.79% of its peak, further emphasizing the strong market sentiment surrounding Arista Networks. From a valuation perspective, Arista Networks is trading at a P/E ratio of 50.52 (adjusted for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024). This high earnings multiple is consistent with the InvestingPro Tip indicating that ANET is "Trading at a high earnings multiple." While this may suggest a premium valuation, it's important to consider the company's growth prospects and market position when evaluating its stock price. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 17 additional tips for Arista Networks, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial health and market position.

Title: Watch These Meta Platforms Price Levels as AI Optimism Boosts Stock to Record High
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/meta-platforms-stock-price-levels-to-watch-record-high-ai-optimism-facebook-instagram-8723221
Time Published: 2024-10-04T16:11:15Z
Full Content:
Meta Platforms (META) shares hit another record high Friday as investors continue to pile into the stock, impressed by the tech giant’s latest artificial intelligence (AI) and metaverse innovations revealed last week at the company’s Connect conference. Earlier this week, the shares received a boost after Pivotal Research analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak initiated coverage on the stock with a “buy” rating, pointing out that the Facebook and Instagram parent’s AI initiatives have it well placed to boost user engagement, helping the company gain market share in search and social media. Meta shares were up 0.4% at around $585 in midday trading Friday. The stock has gained 65% so far in 2024, handily outpacing the S&P 500’s return of around 20% over the same period. Below, we take a closer look at the technicals on Meta’s chart and point out key price levels worth watching. Meta’s price has continued to grind higher since breaking out from an ascending triangle last month, however, trading volumes have decreased throughout the move, potentially signaling a tiring uptrend in the stock. Moreover, while the relative strength index (RSI) confirms bullish price momentum, it also warns of overbought conditions, opening the door to short-term profit taking. Looking ahead, investors should eye several key retracement levels on Meta’s chart, while also monitoring a couple of bullish price targets we can forecast using technical analysis. During an initial pullback in the stock, it’s worth keeping an eye on the $535 level, a key region on the chart near the ascending triangle top trendline that may have flip from providing prior resistance into offering future support. A breakdown below this level could signal a potential trend reversal, leading to a retest of lower support around $480, an area where the shares would likely attract buying interest near the rising 200-day moving average and a range of similar trading levels on the chart between February and August. Forecasting chart-based price targets essentially works by using historical price action to predict future moves. To project a price target using the measuring principle, we calculate the distance between the symmetrical triangle’s two trendlines near the start of the pattern and add that amount to the breakout point. In this case, we add $165 to $535, which forecasts a target of $700. We can predict a price target using the bars pattern by taking Meta’s trend higher from December to March and overlaying it on the chart from last month’s low, a technique that forecasts a target of around $790. The prior move, which also started from the lower trendline of an earlier ascending triangle, occurred over 62 trading days, meaning a similar trending move could potentially play out until early December if price history rhymes.

Title: Dave Vellante’s Breaking Analysis: The complete collection

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / OCTOBER 04 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas.

Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world.

It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year.

Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis.

In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg overtakes Jeff Bezos as world's second-richest person as Meta shares hit all-time high

What just happened? Mark Zuckerberg has achieved a lot during his long career in the tech industry, but yesterday saw the Meta CEO achieve another first: he is now the second richest person in the world, having passed Jeff Bezos after his total net worth reached $206 billion. Things weren't looking rosy for Meta in 2022 as it suffered a downturn following the pandemic boom period. For the first time since its inception 17 years ago, the number of global daily Facebook users declined as the company's shares fell 24%, wiping $200 billion off its market value. But Meta's shares have skyrocketed since then, climbing from $90 in November 2022 to $582.77 today. The price has increased over 64% during the year-to-date period alone. Meta's success has seen Zuckerberg's fortune climb to $206 billion – he has a 13% stake in the company – putting him ahead of third-place Bezos by $1 billion, though the Meta boss is still $50 billion behind leader Elon Musk. Courtesy of Bloomberg One area of the Bloomberg Billionaire's Index where Zuckerberg does lead is the year-to-date change. His wealth has increased an enormous $78.1 billion this year, almost $15 billion more than second-place Jensen Huang, whose fortune has jumped $63.5 billion on the back of Nvidia providing the majority of the advanced AI hardware being used today. As is sadly so often the case, Meta's turnaround was prompted by a streamlining process that saw 21,000 people let go from the firm. Investors welcomed the cost-cutting move, sending the stock in the right direction. Meta stock price over the last five years Meta has reported better-than-expected sales this year, and is pushing hard into the generative AI field with its own Large Language Models and chatbots – the sort of stuff that investors love, even if most of the public isn't as enthusiastic. Meta's stock has reached an all-time high following Meta Connect 2024, which had huge focus on artificial intelligence. The company also revealed several new tech products, including a pair of AR smart glasses capable of projecting holograms directly into a user's field of vision. Jensen Huang called the Project Orion glasses "a big deal." TECHSPOT : Tech Enthusiasts, Power Users, Gamers TechSpot is a registered trademark.

Title: BofA cuts Warner Music stock target by 10%, downgrades to Underperform
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/bofa-cuts-warner-music-stock-target-by-10-downgrades-to-underperform-93CH-3648873

On Friday, BofA Securities revised its stance on Warner Music Group (NASDAQ:WMG), shifting the rating from Neutral to Underperform. The firm also lowered its price target for the company's shares from $33.00 to $30.00. The revision reflects a valuation based on approximately 12 times the projected CY25 OIBDA, a decrease from the previous 13 times estimation. The analyst from BofA Securities cited a combination of factors for the downgrade, including the underperformance of emerging platforms within the industry, such as the TikTok renewal and the loss of Meta (NASDAQ:META)'s premium video. Additionally, the volatility in ad-supported streaming and greater variability in subscription streaming than previously anticipated were noted as concerns. Market share shifts and several one-time items, like the BMG in FY24 and DSP repricing in prior years, were also mentioned as contributing factors. Despite these challenges, Warner Music Group is expected to continue benefiting from secular tailwinds in the music industry, such as pricing and increased penetration, which should drive long-term growth. However, the analyst expressed that the growth potential and visibility for music labels may not be as significant and predictable as initially thought. The report emphasizes that the current premium valuation of music labels does not align with the level of predictability and potential growth when compared to the broader Media & Entertainment coverage universe. This assessment led to the decision to downgrade Warner Music Group's stock to Underperform. In other recent news, Warner Music Group Corp. has made strategic financial moves to optimize its debt portfolio, including an amendment to its senior secured term loan facility. This amendment, involving JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) Bank, introduces a competitive interest rate structure tied to the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR). Meanwhile, Tigress Financial Partners has maintained a Buy rating on Warner Music Group and increased the 12-month price target to $44.00, citing the company's strong positioning in the growth of subscription streaming revenue. On the other hand, Citi has revised its stance on Warner Music Group, reducing the price target from the previous $37.00 to $31.00, while maintaining a Neutral rating on the stock. This adjustment comes in response to Warner Music's fiscal third-quarter 2024 performance, which showed revenue and adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) figures that fell short of market expectations. In the company's third-quarter earnings call, a modest 1% increase in total revenue was reported, with music publishing revenue growing by 9% and recorded music revenue witnessing a slight decline of 1%. Subscription streaming, however, remained a highlight with a robust 14% growth. Despite challenges, Warner Music Group remains optimistic about the streaming market and is focused on long-term growth. Recent data from InvestingPro offers additional context to BofA Securities' downgrade of Warner Music Group (NASDAQ:WMG). Despite the challenges outlined in the analyst report, WMG maintains a market capitalization of $16.5 billion and has demonstrated a strong revenue of $6.38 billion over the last twelve months as of Q3 2024. The company's revenue growth of 7.3% during this period, coupled with an EBITDA growth of 18.63%, suggests resilience in its core business. However, aligning with BofA's concerns about valuation, InvestingPro data indicates that WMG is trading at a high P/E ratio of 30.44 and a notably high Price/Book multiple of 34.16. These metrics support the analyst's view that the current stock price may not reflect the company's growth prospects accurately. InvestingPro Tips highlight that WMG has raised its dividend for 4 consecutive years, which could be attractive to income-focused investors. However, the tip noting that "2 analysts have revised their earnings downwards for the upcoming period" corroborates the cautious stance taken by BofA Securities. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 7 additional tips that could provide further insights into WMG's financial health and market position.

Fear of missing out has rocketed the value of artificial intelligence companies, despite few signs as to when the technology will turn a profit, raising talk of AI overenthusiasm. The mystery deepens when it comes to predicting which generative AI firms will prevail. ChatGPT-maker OpenAI secured $6.6 billion in a funding round that propelled its valuation to an eye-popping $157 billion, sparking new worries there is an AI bubble poised to burst. "We are in the bubble where all the vendors are running around saying you have to deploy it as the latest digital transformation move," Rob Enderle of Enderle Group said of generative AI. "I expect this ugly phase for the next two to three years, but then things should settle." To the critics, buyers don't really understand the technology, and the market needed for it to thrive is not mature yet. Enderle also contended that investors are pouring money into generative AI companies with the mistaken notion we are close to technology that has computers thinking the way humans do, called general artificial intelligence. That "holy grail" won't show up until 2030 at the earliest, he said. Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft have thrown their weight behind the technology, entering into partnerships and pushing out products to accelerate adoption. But the tech giants are spending big to provide sometimes flawed features that for now cost them more than they take in from users. The huge investments in OpenAI shows that Big Tech is willing to sink "substantial cash into a company that's dealing with significant operation losses," Emarketer analyst Grace Harmon said of the OpenAI funding round. There's a "lingering fear of underinvesting in AI and losing out...even if investments are not guaranteed to provide returns," she said. Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst, is one of Wall Street's biggest believers in generative AI's importance and compared ChatGPT's emergence to an "iPhone moment" that will see one trillion dollars in spending during the next three years. An "AI Revolution is not just at our doorstep, but is actively shaping the future of the tech world," he said after OpenAI's historic fund-raise. Wall Street for now stands firmly with Ives and has sent the stock price of AI-chasing tech giants to record levels since ChatGPT burst on the scene in late 2022. Nvidia, the AI-chip juggernaut, in June briefly became the world's biggest company by market valuation amid the frenzy. But according to media reports, OpenAI will lose $5 billion this year on sales of $3.7 billion. The company told investors the pain will be short-lived and that revenue will rise exponentially, hitting a whopping $100 billion in 2029. The question is whether people will pay for generative AI services such as Microsoft's CoPilot that depends on OpenAI technology, said Creative Strategies analyst Carolina Milanesi. "Investors are not sure what the destination is, but everybody is jumping on the boat and they don't want to be left behind," Enderle said. "That typically ends badly," he said. Syria has submitted an application to join the BRICS bloc of developing economies, according to an announcement by the country’s ambassador to Moscow in an interview with Russian state television. Türkiye technology event, TEKNOFEST, hosted in the southern city of Adana this year, attracted approximately 1.1 million visitors. Two Turkish clubs launch their Europa League league stage campaigns on Sept. 26, when Beşiktaş travels to Ajax and Fenerbahçe hosts Union SG.

Friday, 04 Oct 2024 OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, has closed a massive funding round, an investor said on Oct 2, 2024, as the company led by CEO Sam Altman seals its place as the world leader on artificial intelligence. — AFP SAN FRANCISCO: Fear of missing out has rocketed the value of artificial intelligence companies, despite few signs as to when the technology will turn a profit, raising talk of AI overenthusiasm. The mystery deepens when it comes to predicting which generative AI firms will prevail, according to analysts interviewed by AFP. ChatGPT-maker OpenAI secured US$6.6bil (RM27.95bil) in a funding round that propelled its valuation to an eye-popping US$157bil (RM664.94bil), sparking new worries there is an AI bubble poised to burst. "We are in the bubble where all the vendors are running around saying you have to deploy it as the latest digital transformation move," independent tech analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group said of generative AI. "I expect this ugly phase for the next two to three years, but then things should settle." To the critics, buyers don't really understand the technology, and the market needed for it to thrive is not mature yet. Enderle also contended that investors are pouring money into generative AI companies with the mistaken notion we are close to technology that has computers thinking the way humans do, called general artificial intelligence. That "holy grail" won't show up until 2030 at the earliest, he said. 'Revolution' is here Industry titans Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft have thrown their weight behind the technology, entering into partnerships and pushing out products to accelerate adoption. But the tech giants are spending big to provide sometimes flawed features that for now cost them more than they take in from users. The huge investments in OpenAI shows that Big Tech is willing to sink "substantial cash into a company that's dealing with significant operation losses", Emarketer analyst Grace Harmon said of the OpenAI funding round.

The company told investors the pain will be short-lived and that revenue will rise exponentially, hitting a whopping US$100bil (RM423.50bil) in 2029. More than poems? The question is whether people will pay for generative AI services such as Microsoft's CoPilot that depends on OpenAI technology, said Creative Strategies analyst Carolina Milanesi, who pushed back against the idea of an AI bubble. "Consumers are going to start going beyond the write-the-poem-for-me stuff," Milanesi said. "It will become part of our lives and we will depend on it, because we will be forced to." But for now, the generative AI business model is tough, since data center and computing power costs dwarf revenue, according to analysts. Still, Milanesi doesn't think the tech industry is getting carried away with generative AI. "How this shakes out is the way to think about it, not so much the bubble bursting and everyone losing out," Milanesi said. "It's a bit of a Darwin situation where the survival of the fittest is happening," she said. And while there is more excitement about generative AI than real proof of its success, the technology is moving exceptionally fast. "Investors are not sure what the destination is, but everybody is jumping on the boat and they don't want to be left behind," Enderle said. "That typically ends badly," he said. – AFP Topic: Report it to us. Thank you for your report! Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad [197101000523 (10894-D)] Best viewed on Chrome browsers.

The shares were sold at varying prices, with a range between $379.59 and $388.37. This series of transactions indicates a notable change in Giancarlo's holdings in the company, yet it remains unclear what motivated the sales.

Giancarlo's sales were spread across several transactions, with prices provided as weighted averages. The detailed price ranges for each batch of shares were specified in footnotes to the filing, with the assurance that further information would be provided upon request. The sales have resulted in a decrease in Giancarlo's direct holdings in Arista Networks, yet he still retains a substantial number of shares held indirectly by a family trust, for which he serves as co-trustee. After the sales, the trust still owns 47,133 shares of common stock in the company. Investors often monitor insider transactions for insights into executive sentiment regarding their company's stock.

It is important to note that these transactions were conducted under a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, which was established by Taxay on September 14, 2023. Such plans allow insiders to establish pre-planned transactions to sell a specified number of shares at a predetermined time, which can provide them with a defense against potential insider trading accusations. Investors often monitor insider transactions as they can provide insights into the perspectives of high-ranking officials within the company regarding the stock's value. While sales can suggest a variety of things, they may also be part of a personal financial planning strategy and not necessarily indicative of the company's future performance.

Arista Networks, headquartered in Santa Clara, California, is a leader in the field of computer communications equipment, specializing in cloud networking solutions for large data center and campus environments. In other recent news, Arista Networks continues to attract attention with significant developments. Goldman Sachs maintained a Buy rating on Arista Networks, projecting a 20% revenue growth in 2024 and 2025, with an increased EPS estimate for these years. This optimism is fueled by anticipated capital expenditure from major cloud customers and the transition from pilot to production in three significant AI cluster projects. Evercore ISI also maintained its Outperform rating on Arista, indicating the potential revenue opportunity from Meta (NASDAQ:META)'s development of a massive new AI model training cluster. Deutsche Bank maintained its Hold rating on Arista, suggesting a positive outlook for the company's growth potential through 2025.

Additionally, the company's liquid assets exceed short-term obligations, suggesting a strong liquidity position.

The transaction, which took place on October 1, 2024, was executed at a price of $578.55 per share, resulting in a total sale amount of over $523,587. The sale was conducted under a pre-arranged trading plan, known as a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which Newstead had adopted on November 30, 2023. These plans allow company insiders to sell a predetermined number of shares at a predetermined time, providing an affirmative defense against accusations of trading on non-public, material information. Following the transaction, Newstead retains ownership of 35,102 shares of Meta Platforms' common stock. The company, formerly known as Facebook Inc ., is a leader in the technology sector, specializing in computer programming, data processing, and other related services. Investors and market watchers often pay close attention to insider transactions as they can provide valuable insights into the company's health and the confidence levels of its top executives. However, it's important to note that these transactions do not necessarily indicate a change in company strategy or future performance. Meta Platforms has not released any official statement regarding this recent transaction by its Chief Legal Officer. The company's stock continues to be actively traded on the NASDAQ, and investors are encouraged to consider a wide range of factors when assessing the investment potential of META shares. In other recent news, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). has been a focal point of various financial updates and regulatory news. Wells Fargo has raised its stock price target for Meta to $652, anticipating above-consensus earnings for 2025. The firm projects a 21% year-over-year increase in advertising revenue, estimating third-quarter revenue to be around $40.7 billion. On the regulatory front, Meta has faced a €91 million fine imposed by Ireland's Data Protection Commission for a security lapse involving user password storage. This adds to the company's growing tally of penalties under the EU's stringent General Data Protection Regulation. In collaboration with Australian banks, Meta has removed around 8,000 fraudulent ads from its platforms, a move amidst increasing scam reports in Australia and pending anti-scam legislation. Analysts remain optimistic about the company's future, with Pivotal Research giving Meta a Buy rating, citing the company's expansive user base and successful product development track record. Monness, Crespi, Hardt, and Rosenblatt Securities also maintain a positive outlook on Meta's stock, highlighting its potential in AI and metaverse innovations. These are recent developments in Meta's business landscape, providing investors with a snapshot of the company's current standing. To provide additional context to Jennifer Newstead's recent stock sale, let's examine some key financial metrics and insights from InvestingPro for Meta Platforms. As of the latest data, Meta boasts a substantial market capitalization of $1.47 trillion, reflecting its dominant position in the tech sector. The company's financial health appears robust, with an InvestingPro Tip noting that Meta "holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet." This strong liquidity position aligns with the company's ability to navigate market fluctuations and invest in growth initiatives. Meta's profitability metrics are particularly impressive. The company reported a gross profit margin of 81.49% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, which InvestingPro highlights as "impressive gross profit margins." This high margin suggests Meta's efficient cost management and strong pricing power in the market. Moreover, Meta's stock performance has been stellar, with a one-year price total return of 94.23% as of the latest data. This aligns with another InvestingPro Tip stating that Meta has shown a "high return over the last year." The stock is currently trading near its 52-week high, with the price at 99.9% of its peak, indicating strong investor confidence. It's worth noting that while the stock's valuation metrics are high, with a P/E ratio of 28.81, Meta is still "trading at a low P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth," according to InvestingPro. This suggests potential upside for investors who believe in the company's growth trajectory.

[+] Images) Nvidia shares reached as high as $124.26 on Thursday before cooling down to $122.80 at market close, a 3.3% jump. The strong trading day materialized after Huang said there was “insane” demand for Nvidia’s upcoming Blackwell chip from companies such as Microsoft, OpenAI, Meta and other AI-adjacent firms, telling CNBC, “Everybody wants to have the most and everybody wants to be first.” The Thursday stock jump continues a streak of Nvidia gains since early September, when the chip designer’s shares slumped to $102.83 despite reporting record revenues about a week prior. Blackwell-based products will be shipped to cloud service divisions at Oracle, Amazon, Microsoft and Google late this year, according to Nvidia’s website.

We estimate Huang’s net worth at $107 billion following a $3 billion increase Thursday, making the Nvidia chief the twelfth-richest person in the world. The next-generation chip from Nvidia can train AI models at fast speeds while using a relatively low share of energy consumption. Blackwell’s price tag is expected to be between $30,000 and $40,000 per unit, according to CNBC. Nvidia’s Blackwell chip will further cement the company as a leader in the artificial intelligence market while it continues to provide products and services for tech leaders like Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and Amazon, which accounts for a large portion of its revenue. Despite some sharp, yet short-lived, drops between July and September, Nvidia’s stock is up more than 147% since the start of the year, when it traded at $48.17 per share. The company also posted record revenues in its second quarter, recording $30 billion in sales and $16.5 billion in net income.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Crunchboard Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Contact Us Google is upgrading its visual search app, Lens, with the ability to answer near-real-time questions about your surroundings. English-speaking Android and iOS users with the Google app installed can now start capturing a video via Lens and ask questions about objects of interest in the video. Lou Wang, director of product management for Lens, said the feature uses a “customized” Gemini model to make sense of the video and pertinent questions. Gemini is Google’s family of AI models and powers a number of products across the company’s portfolio. “Let’s say you want to learn more about some interesting fish,” Wang said in a press briefing. “[Lens will] produce an overview that explains why they’re swimming in a circle, along with more resources and helpful information.” To access Lens’ new video analysis feature, you must sign up for Google’s Search Labs program, as well as opt in to the “AI Overviews and more” experimental features in Labs. In the Google app, holding your smartphone’s shutter button activates Lens’ video-capturing mode. Ask a question while recording a video, and Lens will link out to an answer supplied by AI Overviews, the feature in Google Search that uses AI to summarize information from around the web. According to Wang, Lens uses AI to determine which frames in a video are most “interesting” and salient — and above all, relevant to the question being asked — and uses these to “ground” the answer from AI Overviews. “All this comes from an observation of how people are trying to use things like Lens right now,” Wang said. “If you lower the barrier of asking these questions and helping people satisfy their curiosity, people are going to pick this up pretty naturally.” The launch of video for Lens comes on the heels of a similar feature Meta previewed last month for its AR glasses, Ray-Ban Meta. Meta plans to bring real-time AI video capabilities to the glasses, letting wearers ask questions about what’s around them (e.g., “What type of flower is this?”). OpenAI has also teased a feature that lets its Advanced Voice Mode tool understand videos. Eventually, Advanced Voice Mode — a premium ChatGPT feature — will be able to analyze videos in real time and take context into account as it answers you. Google has beaten both companies to the punch, it seems — minus the fact that Lens is asynchronous (you can’t chat with it in real time), and assuming that the video feature works as advertised. We weren’t shown a live demo during the press briefing, and Google has a history of overpromising when it comes to its AI’s capabilities. Aside from video analysis, Lens can also now search with images and text in one go. English-speaking users, including those not enrolled in Labs, can launch the Google app and hold the shutter button to take a photo, then ask a question by speaking out loud. Finally, Lens is getting new e-commerce-specific functionality. Starting today, when Lens on Android or iOS recognizes a product, it’ll display information about it, including the price and deals, brand, reviews, and stock. Product ID works on uploaded and newly snapped photos (but not videos), and it is limited to select countries and certain shopping categories, including electronics, toys, and beauty, for now. “Let’s say you saw a backpack, and you like it,” Wang said. “You can use Lens to identify that product and you’ll be able to instantly see details you might be wondering about.” There’s an advertising component to this, too. The results page for Lens-identified products will also show “relevant” shopping ads with options and prices, Google says. Why stick ads in Lens? Because roughly 4 billion Lens searches each month are related to shopping, per Google. For a tech giant whose lifeblood is advertising, it’s simply too lucrative an opportunity to pass up.

Title: UBER shares up 12% since last results, outperforming peers DASH and LYFT, says Wolfe Research analyst

Time Published: 2024-10-03T12:49:12Z
Full Content:
On Thursday, Wolfe Research reiterated its Outperform rating on Uber Technologies Inc . (NYSE:UBER) with a steady price target of $95.00. The firm's positive stance on the ride-hailing giant is attributed to Uber's robust competitive edge and consistent fundamental performance. The company is recognized for its sustained demand for core services and expansion into new categories, products, and markets, all while enhancing profitability and repurchasing shares. Uber's valuation, according to Wolfe Research, is justified by a 25 times multiple on the forecasted 2025 price to free cash flow (P/FCF), a figure aligned with its peer DoorDash (NASDAQ:DASH) Inc., despite Uber's larger scale and stronger free cash flow profile. The target multiple also matches the average for tech megacaps like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. Wolfe Research emphasizes free cash flow as the key valuation metric, considering it a reliable indicator of Uber's transition to earnings and ability to return capital to shareholders. Since the last earnings report on August 6, Uber's stock has seen an increase of 12%, which is observed in the context of its competitors DoorDash and Lyft Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT)., which have experienced gains of 17% and 14%, respectively. This performance is also compared to a 9.5% rise in the Nasdaq index during the same period. Uber's consistent demand for its primary offerings and strategic moves into new verticals and geographical areas are seen as growth drivers. The company's focus on improving its profitability alongside its share buyback program is also highlighted as a contributor to its positive outlook. The reaffirmed price target of $95 by Wolfe Research reflects confidence in Uber's business model and its ability to maintain a strong position in the competitive landscape of ride-sharing and delivery services. Uber's financial strategies and market expansions are key factors in Wolfe Research's assessment of the company's future performance. In other recent news, Uber Technologies has been in the spotlight with several key developments. TD Cowen maintained a Buy rating on Uber shares, emphasizing the potential impact of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology on Uber's business model. The firm suggests that the deployment of lower-cost AVs is crucial for the technology to be economically viable and scalable. Uber has also been active in the autonomous vehicle sector, partnering with Chinese firm WeRide to launch robotaxis in the United Arab Emirates in 2024. This initiative, along with Uber's expanded partnership with Alphabet's Waymo, reflects the company's commitment to incorporate autonomous vehicles into its service offerings. Analysts at Oppenheimer and KeyBanc have both increased their price targets for Uber, citing growth prospects in delivery services and operational efficiency. Oppenheimer's survey revealed a positive outlook for Uber's restaurant and grocery delivery services, indicating potential for increased order frequency among current users. KeyBanc highlighted Uber's potential for EBITDA growth driven by operational efficiencies. Uber has also formed a delivery partnership with Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI), aiming to meet growing customer demand for home delivery options. This collaboration is set to begin at select Olive Garden locations in late 2024. Finally, BTIG maintained its Buy rating on Uber, emphasizing the company's consistent growth in the rideshare and delivery sectors. This analysis supports Uber's third-quarter guidance of 18-23% growth, potentially marking the fifth consecutive quarter with a growth rate of 20% or better. Complementing Wolfe Research's bullish outlook on Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE:UBER), recent data from InvestingPro provides additional context to the company's financial performance and market position. Uber's market capitalization stands at an impressive $153.1 billion, reflecting its dominant position in the ground transportation industry. InvestingPro Tips highlight that Uber's net income is expected to grow this year, aligning with Wolfe Research's positive stance on the company's profitability trajectory. This growth expectation is further supported by the fact that three analysts have revised their earnings upwards for the upcoming period, indicating growing confidence in Uber's financial performance. The company's revenue for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 reached $40.06 billion, with a solid revenue growth of 14.44% over the same period. This robust top-line performance underscores Uber's ability to expand its market presence and capitalize on the growing demand for its services, as noted in the article. Investors should note that Uber is trading at a high P/E ratio of 75.19, which may seem elevated but could be justified by its strong growth prospects and market leadership. An InvestingPro Tip suggests that Uber is trading at a low P/E ratio relative to its near-term earnings growth, potentially indicating an attractive entry point for long-term investors. For those interested in a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 13 additional tips on Uber, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial health and market position.

In a wide-ranging interview with CNBC this week, Siemiatkowski said that unfavorable rules in Europe on employee stock options — a common form of equity compensation tech firms offer to their staff — could lead to Klarna losing talent to technology giants in the U.S. such as Google, Apple and Meta. As Klarna — which is known for its popular buy now, pay later installment plans — prepares for its IPO, the lack of attractiveness of Europe as a place for the best and brightest to work has become a much more prominent fear, Siemiatkowski told CNBC. "When we looked at the risks of the IPO, which is a number one risk in my opinion? Our compensation," said Siemiatkowski, who is approaching his 20th year as CEO of the financial technology firm. He was referring to company risk factors, which are a common element of IPO prospectus filings. Compared to a basket of its publicly-listed peers, Klarna offers only a fifth of its equity as a share of its revenue, according to a study obtained by CNBC which the company paid consulting firm Compensia to produce. However, the study also showed that Klarna's publicly-listed peers offer six times the amount of equity that it does. Siemiatkowski said there a number of hurdles blocking Klarna and its European tech peers from offering employees in the region more favorable employee stock option plans, including costs that erode the value of shares they are granted when they join. In the U.K. and Sweden, he explained that employee social security payments deducted from their stock rewards are "uncapped," meaning that staff at companies in these countries stand to lose more than people at firms in, say, Germany and Italy where there are concrete caps in place. The higher a firm's stock price, the more it must pay toward employees' social benefits, making it difficult for companies to plan expenses effectively. Britain and Sweden also calculate social benefits on the actual value of employees' equity upon sale in liquidity events like an IPO. "It's not that companies are not willing to pay that," Siemiatkowski said. "The biggest issue is the lack of predictability. If a staff cost is entirely associated with my stock price, and that has implications on my PNL [profit and loss] ... it has cost implications for the company. It makes it impossible to plan." In the past year, Siemiatkowski has more clearly signalled Klarna's ambitions to go public soon. In an interview with CNBC's "Closing Bell," he said that a 2024 listing was "not impossible." In August, Bloomberg reported Klarna was close to selecting Goldman Sachs as the lead underwriter for its IPO in 2025. Siemiatkowski declined to comment on where the company will go public and said nothing has been confirmed yet on timing. Still, when it does go public, Klarna will be among the first major fintech names to successfully debut on a stock exchange in several years. Affirm, one of Klarna's closest competitors in the U.S., went public in 2021. Afterpay, another Klarna competitor, was acquired by Jack Dorsey's payments company Block in 2021 for $29 billion. A study by venture capital firm Index Ventures last year found that, on average, employees at late-stage European startups own around 10% of the companies they work for, compared to 20% in the U.S. Out of a selection of 24 countries, the U.K. ranks highly overall. However, it does a poorer job when it comes to the administration burdens associated with treatment of these plans. Sweden, meanwhile, fares worse, performing badly on factors such as the scope of the plans and strike price, the Index study said. Asked whether he's worried Klarna employees may look to leave the company for an American tech firm instead, Siemiakowski said it's a "risk," particularly as the firm is expanding aggressively in the U.S. "The more prominent we become in the U.S market, the more people see us and recognize us — and the more their LinkedIn inbox is going to be pinged by offers from others," Siemiatkowski told CNBC. He added that, in Europe, there's "unfortunately a sentiment that you shouldn't pay that much to really talented people," especially when it comes to people working in the financial services industry. "There is more of that sentiment than in the U.S., and that is unfortunately hurting competitiveness," Klarna's co-founder said. "If you get approached by Google, they will fix your visa. They will transfer you to the U.S. These issues that used to be there, they're not there anymore." "The most talented pool is very mobile today," he added, noting that its now easier for staff to work remotely from a region that's outside a company's physical office space.

Title: Microsoft HoloLens 2 headset discontinued

News Microsoft will be discontinuing its HoloLens 2 headset once stock runs out, according to UploadVR. The mixed reality headset HoloLens 2 debuted in 2019, three years after its predecessor, the HoloLens, launched. Due to its hefty price tag, the product is mostly marketed towards businesses and enterprises. Production is grinding to a halt, and security updates will continue until December 31, 2027. Software updates will stop after that. Microsoft apparently does not intend to produce a third iteration of the HoloLens, as it’s believed that the company has canceled the project due to ‘lack of focus and internal hardware development challenges’. The mixed reality team has slowly dwindled as well this year and the last. The HoloLens IVA will continue as a system and an AR headset for the US army. Microsoft recently brought its Office apps and Xbox Cloud Gaming on the Meta Quest headsets and will be working with the company for Windows 11 integration. iLounge is an independent resource for all things iPod, iPhone, iPad, and beyond. iPod, iPhone, iPad, iTunes, Apple TV, and the Apple logo are trademarks of Apple Inc.

Title: This is probably your last chance to get the 128GB Quest 3, but it's not the only VR headset discount I'd recommend right now

Don't wait around on this, because stock is already disappearing When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. We finally got confirmation last week that the Meta Quest 3S is real, and it's arriving this year. As a few rumors hinted though, it does mean that Meta is discontinuing some of its existing headsets to make room for a more affordable model. The Quest 2 and Quest Pro have been drifting in and out of stock for a while now, so while it's sad they'll now be officially retired, it's the 128GB model of the Meta Quest 3 I'm more surprised about. The 128GB Quest 3 only launched this time last year and it's been one of the most accessible VR headsets worth buying ever since. VR games are relatively small, so for many people, paying more for a 512GB SKU hasn't been all that necessary. Since the announcement the 128GB version's death warrant was signed though, it feels like it's entered clearance mode. In the US, Best Buy is one of the last remaining suppliers with stock available, and it's reduced the device's price from $499.99 down to $429, giving you a sweet $70 saving. In the UK, Amazon has followed suit, dropping the cost to just £409.99 down from £479. It goes without saying, but I've not seen the Quest 3 hit this low a price tag since it launched last year, and I've been keeping a close eye on the headset's deals in that time. Amazon's US stock of the 128GB Quest 3 has already disappeared entirely, so if you're wanting a cheaper route into Meta's flagship device, I wouldn't wait around. I'd be surprised if this VR headset didn't transition into a collector's item by the time Prime Day Meta Quest deals officially start next week. Meta Quest 3 128GB | $499.99 $429.99 at Best Buy Save $70 - The 128GB Meta Quest 3 probably doesn't have much stock left, so this $70 saving is a great way to grab one before your only option is the more expensive 512GB SKU. As an added bonus, you'll also get a free copy of Batman Arkham Shadow when it launches later this year. Buy it if: ✅ You want more storage space ✅ You want mixed reality features ✅ You're interested in playing SteamVR games Don't buy it if: ❌ You already play games on a PS5 UK: £409.99 at Amazon But why is the Quest 3 being discontinued, I hear you ask? Well, since the Quest 3S is targeting that more approachable market of first-time VR buyers or those who don't want to invest more than $350 on a standalone headset, the Quest 3 proper needs to stand out as an enthusiast device. Limiting choice to the 512GB model only distinguishes it from the competition, since other standalone headsets tend to offer less storage. While it's certainly sad that the Quest 3 128GB is no more, you can take solace in the fact that the 512GB SKU has now dropped in price slightly as well. In the UK and US, it's cheaper than it's ever been, dropping to $499 down from its original MSRP of $649, or £469 in the UK. That's an amazing reduction in its own right, although it's a massive slap in the face to anyone who bought that headset in the last few months at a higher price. Regardless of which Quest headset you buy, you'll get to benefit from the Batman Arkham Shadow pre-order bonus that's available for the Quest 3S. In all of Quest 3's life so far, this question has never been so hard to answer. If you want the best Quest headset in terms of its internal specs, but you don't want to spend money on a version with more storage, then absolutely jump on this 128GB model clearance sale. Truth be told, you'd struggle to fill up 512GB of space even if you use the headset daily for gaming and work. VR titles really are surprisingly small, so 128GB is more space than you'd think. That said, the competition has never been so fierce. Not only do you have the Meta Quest 3S to think about now, but if you're in the UK, you have the Pico 4 Ultra to consider, which is arguably better than the Quest 3 anyway. HTC Vive is also re-entering the consumer market with the Vive Focus Vision, which is a much higher-end device targeted at PC gamers. Then, you have what I'd argue is the Quest 3's biggest competition, PSVR 2. Almost like clockwork, Sony's headset has dropped in price as well. Its MSRP is $549, and Walmart is currently listing it for $449, a whole $100 cheaper. In the UK, you can grab one for just £500 at Amazon, which really puts it up against the new price of the 512GB Quest 3. Any direction you look in, you have amazing opportunities to get into VR gaming at the moment. All of these headsets are worth the money, and as a lover of this technology, I couldn't be happier to say that. Competition is great for any industry, and since this has always been prohibitively expensive hardware, all of these discounts mean that more people will be able to get their heads in a visor. If that's the case now, I can't wait to see what Black Friday VR headset deals and Black Friday Meta Quest deals have in store.

Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more Ever since playing Journey at the age of 15, I’ve been desperate to cover video games for a living.

Besides that, I’ve been managing my own YouTube channel and Podcast for the last 7 years. It’s been a long road, but all that experience somehow landed me a dream job covering gaming hardware. I’m a self-confessing PlayStation fanboy, but my experience covering the larger business and developer side of the whole industry has given me a strong knowledge of all platforms. When I’m not testing out every peripheral I can get my hands on, I’m probably either playing tennis or dissecting game design for an upcoming video essay.

These innovations are part of Pinterest's efforts to improve its lower funnel ad products. During the event, Pinterest also presented various case studies from consumer packaged goods (CPG), eCommerce, and finance advertisers. These case studies demonstrated the platform's effectiveness in delivering improved return on investment (ROI) for advertisers and underscored Pinterest's growing influence in performance marketing budgets. BofA Securities highlighted Pinterest's continued integration of AI technology. Drawing parallels to the success experienced by Meta (NASDAQ:META) in similar endeavors, BofA expressed optimism regarding Pinterest's potential to achieve double-digit core growth by 2025. In other recent news, Pinterest Inc has been the subject of various analyst reviews and ratings. Baird reiterated an Outperform rating for Pinterest, highlighting the company's potential for sustained growth in user base, engagement, and monetization. The follows Pinterest's annual global advertising event, Pinterest Presents, which showcased the platform's advancements. Oppenheimer also initiated coverage of Pinterest with an Outperform rating, emphasizing the platform's unique position in the digital advertising space.

Pinterest's market cap stands at $22.48 billion, reflecting its significant presence in the social media and e-commerce space. The company's revenue growth remains robust, with a 20.57% increase in the most recent quarter, aligning with CEO Bill Ready's focus on enhancing advertising products and expanding market reach. InvestingPro Tips highlight Pinterest's strong financial position, noting that the company "holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet" and "liquid assets exceed short-term obligations." These factors provide Pinterest with financial flexibility to invest in the new advertising tools and AI technologies mentioned in the article. Another relevant InvestingPro Tip indicates that "net income is expected to grow this year," which could be partly attributed to the improved advertising products and expanded market reach discussed at the Pinterest Presents event.

Title: Microsoft HoloLens is officially dead — so buy one now while stocks last

Microsoft confirms no HoloLens devices will be supported after 2027 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Microsoft has officially confirmed it will be halting production and sales of its HoloLens mixed reality headsets. In a statement to UploadVR, the company said it has ended production of the HoloLens 2 device, the latest model (albeit one released in 2019), with customers only now able to buy new devices while stock lasts. Microsoft HoloLens 2 will continue to receive "updates to address critical security issues and software regressions" until December 31 2027, the company noted. The news may come as little surprise, as Microsoft has not been focusing too much attention on HoloLens in recent years, as the company's focus drifts more towards AI, despite HoloLens 2 users finally getting a Windows 11 software update in April 2023. The original HoloLens headset, which will see software support end on December 10, 2024, was launched in 2016, with the company promising a new age of augmented and virtual reality experiences. However initial reception and sales were poor, as was the case for the HoloLens 2, partly due to its $3,500 price tag at launch, which placed it firmly in the range of enterprises only. This included specialist editions built for the US Department of Defense, with the US Army remaining committed to the wide-scale test of its HoloLens IVAS device in 2025. An initial order of 5,000 headsets, thought to be worth around $373 million, was signed off by Assistant Secretary for Acquisition Douglas Bush in September 2022 following successful field tests. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The company had apparently been considering plans for a HoloLens 3 device, but appeared to quietly drop this following layoffs and financial cutbacks that affected the project’s workers. The former head of the HoloLens division, Alex Kipman, also departed Microsoft in 2022 following misconduct allegations, with the likes of Meta and Apple making the headset space far more congested.

Title: What is Databricks?
URL: https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/8101/what-is-databricks/
Time Published: 2024-10-02T04:39:03Z
Full Content:
By: John Miner | Updated: 2024-10-02 | Comments | Related: > Azure Databricks Databricks, Inc. is a data, analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI) company founded by the original creators of Apache Spark. The Platform as a Service (PaaS) has evolved over the years with support on Microsoft Azure and Amazon cloud-based platforms. Databricks purchased six companies to add features to its offerings, such as ML OPS, Data Governance, and Generative AI. As a new data engineer, how can I quickly get up to speed using the Databricks platform? At the core of Databricks' offering is the Apache Spark Engine. Initially, this engine was written in Object Oriented Java (Scala). However, the demands of big data have increased, requiring additional speed. Databricks added Photon to the Runtime engine. Photon is a new vectorized engine written in C++. The image below shows the traditional offerings from the Spark Ecosystem. These four areas will be covered at a summary level today. I suggest trying to use the Photon engine due to its speed. The image below is from the Databricks website. Just remember that this offer comes at an additional price. Check to see if you meet both your SLAs for data processing and monthly operating expenses (budget). Our manager has asked us to provide a high-level overview of the Databricks ecosystem to our senior management. The company has a large amount of data in an aging on-premises data center. The goal is to understand what is Databricks and associated ecosystem for business intelligence, data analytics and decision making. The above table outlines the topics that will be discussed in this tip. One nice feature about Databricks is that it can run on all three major cloud vendors (AWS, AZURE, GCP). Regardless of the technology, engineers refer to the data plane and control plane. The control plane is where coding and scheduling can be done. Most services depend on a cluster, the distributed computing power for Spark. See the architecture diagram below for details. Data engineering is just a fancy name for the extract, transform, and load (ETL) logic packaged in a workflow (job). The use of each step is up to the end user. I might extract (read - data source) from an Azure SQL database and load (write - data destination) to a parquet file using Spark Dataframes. Typically, when dealing with a data lake, one uses medallion zones. The quality of data improves as you go from left to right. The above image was taken from a Microsoft Technical Community article by Mike Carlo. There are two ways to work with files in Apache Spark: Let's start with two sample CSV files that contain weather data. The goal of this exercise is to read the high temperature and low temperature CSV files. Let's join the two dataframes and save them as a Parquet file. The above code loads the low temperate data into a dataframe named df1. The code below loads the high temperate data into a dataframe named df2. The code below writes the results of joining the two tables to a Parquet file. Any duplicate columns are deleted from the results. The syntax for the dataframes has a little learning curve. The PySpark code above was executed on a single node cluster. Without a cluster, no work gets done. The same ELT process can be coded using Spark SQL. The Spark language supports the following file formats: AVRO, CSV, DELTA, JSON, ORC, PARQUET, and TEXT. There is a shortcut syntax that infers the schema and loads the file as a table. The code below has a lot fewer steps and achieves the same results as using the dataframe syntax. The SELECT statement retrieves the first 5 records from the weather table located in the default database schema. There are two types of hive tables: managed and external tables. Regardless of table type, the DELTA file format is the only one that supports ACID transactions. Any INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements executed by the end user against another file format will result in an error. The ACID properties of the DELTA format are achieved by using Parquet data files, Parquet check point files, and JSON transaction logs. To recap, data engineering within Databricks can be done in many ways. Things constantly change in technology. Databricks added the autoloader feature so that engineers did not have to keep track of new vs. old files. The delta live tables (DLT) is a declarative framework that simplifies data ingestion and allows for quality constraints. Both techniques are based on streaming and will be covered in a future tip. The warehouse is a relatively new addition to the Databricks ecosystem. The public preview of the service was released in November 2020. Please see the release notes for details. The SQL Warehouse computing power is measured differently than the Spark Clusters. Please see the documentation for details. With data engineering, you must pick the number of nodes, virtual machine series/size, access mode, and Databricks runtime engine and make any additional Spark configurations. Typically, the computing cluster is spun up with an optional auto-terminate value, which saves the client money by not having the virtual machines running 24 x 7. This computing cluster can be used for interactive tasks or job workflow execution. Most importantly, the computing cluster is carved out of the clients' cloud account. The computing power for the warehouse is measurable and is considered serverless in nature. No virtual machines ever show up in the client's cloud account. These clusters are owned by Databricks Service, are in a warm state, and are used for SQL workloads only. Please see the image below for an extra small cluster size named "Starter Warehouse." The SQL Warehouse environment is built around the schema explorer, the ability to run queries, create reports, add reports to dashboards, and define alerts based on queries. At this point, we are going to rebuild the weather table using the SQL Warehouse and Spark SQL. The code below creates a database (schema) named mssqltips with a comment. Comments are invaluable when a data governance tool is used to harvest predefined tagging. The design pattern below is important to understand. It will be used two times to create tables for both the low temperature and high temperature data files. First, if a managed table exists, we want to delete it. Second, we want to create an empty Delta Table with no schema. Third, we want to use the COPY INTO statement with the correct options. The file format and format options define the source file. Since we want to use the inferred schema from the file, we need to set the copy option to allow merging of schemas. The above code loads the low temperature data, while the code below loads the high temperature data. The last step is to create a view to join the two tables. Please note that the Spark SQL language allows for comments at the table level, view level, and the column level. The image below summarizes the options the developer has with the SQL warehouse: edit new queries, view saved queries, create dashboards from visuals, create alerts based on queries, view query history, and manage warehouses. In short, we can see we have two tables in the hive meta store. A simple SELECT statement of the view we created with a limit of five records is shown below. To recap, many of the data engineering features that you can do with Python can be done with the SQL Warehouse. I will cover the details of this service in a future tip. There are many ways a data engineer can stream data into a data lake. This section with introduce the simplest use case where CSV files are stored in an Azure Storage Container. We will be using our S&P 500 stock data in this example. The source data files are in a CSV format and the data processing is called structured streaming. The first task is to understand how many source files we have in the raw zone. This can be done by calling the list files method of the file system class in the dbutils library. There are six stock data files from 2013. We always want to use a schema file when dealing with weak file formats. Please see the Spark reference for SQL data types. This comes in handy when crafting a schema string. The maximum number of files that can be processed per triggered stream is set to two files. This number was picked to show you that three triggered events are needed to process six files. There are many options with Spark streaming. Other options include processing all available files in the source folder now and running the streaming process as a continuous event. The check below should always return true. The chances that the incoming stream is correctly formatted are low. We want the date column to be a timestamp that we can use in our Spark SQL queries. Additionally, information such as load time, path to input file, and various parts of the path might be important to the end user. The following code uses the withColumn to create new fields for our dataframe. The writeStream method appends the two CSV files loaded by the readStream method to a delta file. The checkpoint file is very important. This keeps track of files that have been processed. Thus, files will not be re-processed if they are listed in the checkpoint file. To rebuild a delta table, it is best to delete the "streaming" directory, which includes both the delta files and the checkpoint files. The writeStream action will stop once the readStream data is consumed. We can check the status of the write process using the code below. The last step is to stop the stream. This is a very important step that is sometimes overlooked. It is always important to check the results of executing a notebook. We expect two files to be loaded for every triggered event. The query below executes an aggregation directly against the delta file. The expected results show groups of records having the same load date. This section is a brief introduction to streaming. Future articles will talk about autoloader and delta live tables. These two features have changed how big data programmers ingest data. However, both methods are built upon the core Spark streaming concepts. The Graphframe project was introduced to the Spark ecosystem in the summer of 2016. It allows designers to supply vertices and edges as dataframes to the API. Then, interesting social networking questions can be asked. The image below shows a typical network of friends. The image below shows the two Spark Dataframes that are input to the Graphframe. Methods on the Graphframe object can be used to retrieve results from the graph. For instance, how many people are older than 33 or how many people have two or more followers? Please see the detail behind this section's content in a Databricks Engineering Team blog post. There is a knowledge graph use case that has been done with both Airline Flights, Insurance Policies and Life Sciences. Here, we only scratched the surface of what can be done with graph models. There are many different algorithms to retrieve information stored in their structure. A future article will be needed to dive deeper into the subject. Machine learning (ML) can be used to solve various problems, such as classification, regression, text analysis, image recognition, recommendations, and clustering. Here is a great cheat sheet on when to apply which algorithm (technique). The goal of this section is to understand what a data scientist can achieve by using Databricks. The first step in any ML project is to retrieve, clean, and prepare features. Because the data lake can store a variety of files, this is a prime location for the data scientist to explore what is available. The second step is to create a model. Many different algorithms and/or feature selections might be tried until a solution that has an acceptable prediction rate is achieved. The data for creating an algorithm is grouped into two sets. The training data set is used to create the model. The testing data set has a known set of outcomes. We use this set to judge the accuracy of our model. Databricks released ML Flow as an open-source framework in June 2018. Please see the release notes for details. Three key problems are solved by ML Flow: tracking, projects, and models. See the Databricks initial blog on the framework. Why is tracking important? The creation of models is like a lab experiment. Under certain conditions, predictive accuracy is achieved. Both the data and model might change over time. If our ML model drifts over time, the framework is a great place to find out why. The registry allows us to redeploy saved models that might achieve better results. Finally, we need to deploy our model to production. There are many ways to use the model like point-in-time scoring using web services or batch scoring over stored rows in a database. The framework can help with those problems, too. There are many ways to get data into a data lake. Both Spark Dataframes and Spark SQL can be used to ingest and transform your existing files stored in cloud storage. Traditionally, a medallion architecture is used to enhance the data quality as files are moved between the zones. I will talk about advanced data engineering services such as autoloader and delta live tables in the future. To compete in the Data Warehouse computing sector, Databricks created the SQL Warehouse service. The main difference between data engineering and this service is how a cluster is deployed. With traditional clusters, all the nitty gritty details must be configured. The computing power is carved out of the owner's subscription. The SQL Warehouse is considered serverless and T-shirt sizes are used to pick a configuration. The COPY INTO statement is key to getting data from files into DELTA tables. There is only support for the SQL language since this is a Data Warehouse. Other features that you might be interested in such as schedules, reports, dashboards and alerts in will be covered in a future article. The lambda architecture is based upon two lanes. The slow (batch) lane can be handled by the initial data engineering techniques that I covered. The fast (speed) lane is handled by streaming. Today, we covered how structured streaming can process files stored in a storage container. The read and write stream are important methods to learn. There are a couple techniques on how to handle transformations within micro batches. These topics will be covered in a future article. My first introduction to directed graphs was the Traveling Salesperson problem. The key idea behind this problem is there are customers in N cities and directed traveling routes. Starting at the home office, how can you visit all the clients? This problem can be optimized for travel distance, time traveling, and/or total cost. Unfortunately, the Graphframe library cannot solve this problem. However, it can solve other problems such as querying properties of the vertices and edges. It can solve the shortest path problem from one vertex to the next. Please see the documentation for more details. Machine learning has evolved over the years. What I learnt five years ago for my EDX Data Science certificate is totally different than what is available today. Regardless of the libraries and algorithms you are using, the data scientist needs a framework to track projects and models. The key purpose of a data lake is to have all the data in one place so that the data scientist can start feature selection. The clean-up of the data into an ingestible format is the lion share of the work. The selection and tuning of the ML model takes time and iterations. That is why tracking is so important. Finally, the model can be released to production. The work does not stop there. Periodic checking of the accuracy will notify you if the model has drifted and changes are required. This whole process is sometimes referred to as Machine Learning Operations (ML Ops). In summary, today's tutorial is a high-level coverage of five different products that are part of the Databricks ecosystem. I hope you enjoyed the overview and look forward to going deeper into each topic in the future.

Californiaâs Napa Valley wine industry is world-renowned, generating $50 billion annually in economic impact.1âEconomic impact,â Napa Valley Vintners, accessed September 20, 2024.The wines produced among the 700 wineries in the region rival those of any other region across the globe. The story of the Napa wine industry is a familiar one. Only a few decades ago, the region was a rural outpost with a small community of mostly independent vineyards. It boomed after investors and entrepreneurs worked together, put their product to the test, and won awards against the worldâs best in the 1970s. Napa is just one example of places and industries springing up from humble beginnings to become global successes. Dalton, Georgia, is considered a global carpet capital.2George Pendle, âDalton, GA: How a bedspread fiefdom became a carpet kingdom,â Atlas Obscura, July 7, 2015. Eighty-five percent of the carpets sold in the United States and 45 percent sold globally are made in the region. Similarly, High Point, North Carolina, is a global hub for furnitureâat one point the region was responsible for producing 60 percent of all furniture sold in the United States.3âFurniture history: High Point & furniture,â High Point Museum, accessed on September 25, 2024. Its biannual markets host exhibitors from around the world. Today, Napa wineries, Dalton carpet companies, and High Point furniture factories are a mix of big and small businesses, and in many cases still include family-run operations. They succeeded not only because of their product but also because of their ability to efficiently produce it at scale. The regionsâ success illustrates how, under the right conditions, micro-, small, and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs) in any industry can expand their global reach. Productivity is a measure of how efficiently goods and services, or output, are produced, compared with the amount of inputs used.1âInvesting in productivity growth,â McKinsey Global Institute, March 27, 2024. In macroeconomic terms, it is defined as the value of the goods and services produced, divided by the amount of labor, capital, and other resources required for its production. For this report, we focus on labor productivity, measured as value added per worker (in US dollars at purchasing-power parity). While the more accurate measure of labor productivity is value added per hour workedâas the number of weekly hours worked varies substantially among US states. For example, the average weekly hours worked by production employees on manufacturing payrolls in the United States varied from 27.7 hours in Alaska to 44.3 hours in Louisiana in 2023.2âState and metro area employment, hours, & earnings,â US Bureau of Labor Statistics, April 2023. We use the per-worker metric, as it is more commonly available across size categories and sectors. Due to the lack of comprehensive data at the individual company level for micro-, small, and medium-size enterprises, we rely on subsector-level average productivity to make inferences.3We focus on national- or sector-level productivity from a growth economics perspective. Organizational-productivity research often studies issues related to attrition, disengagement, skills mismatch, or time inefficiency. See, for example, Aaron De Smet, Marino Mugayar-Baldocchi, Angelika Reich, and Bill Schaninger, âSome employees are destroying value. Others are building it. Do you know the difference?,â McKinsey Quarterly, September 11, 2023. To get there, US MSMEs should look to ramping up productivity, a move that will be vital to American competitiveness in the coming years (see sidebar âMeasuring productivityâ). Small businesses can reach the next level of growth by taking advantage of new technology, including generative AI (gen AI), and partnering with bigger companies, and they will need the infrastructure and systems to support them. The McKinsey Global Institute aggregated a richly granular data set of MSMEs and large companies across 12 broad sectors, 68 level-two subsectors, and more than 200 level-three subsectors in 16 countries with different income levels, accounting for more than 50 percent of global GDP. In this group (listed by per capita GDP in 2021 in purchasing-power-parity terms) are ten advanced economies (the United States, Germany, Australia, the United Kingdom, Italy, Israel, Japan, Spain, Poland, and Portugal) and six emerging economies. MSMEs play a large role across the boardâin the advanced economies, they average 66 percent of employment and 54 percent of value added. The United States has an ample small business engine. MSMEs, defined as businesses employing up to 500 people, are a major foundation of economic activity, responsible for 58 percent of jobs and 39 percent of value added in the business economy (Exhibit 1). In some US business sectors, MSMEs have an outsize impact. They account for more than three-fourths of workers and value added in the construction sector, for example. And they account for more than half of all workers and value added in the professional services and accommodation and food sectors (Exhibit 2). MSMEs also help fuel the US economic engine. Companies that were MSMEs at some point since 2000 now represent 17 percent of publicly traded companies valued at $10 billion or more as of 2023 (Exhibit 3). Small technology companies have made the biggest breakthroughsânearly a quarter of large public tech companies were MSMEs in the past 25 years, Meta and Zoom Video Communications among them. Many of todayâs big manufacturing companies also started as small factories. Monster Beverage and Tesla are recent examples. Innovation has been a big factor in fast-scaling companies. Small companies in the tech sector have produced more patents per employee than their bigger competitors.4Robert D. Atkinson, The National Economic Council gets it wrong on the role of big and small firms in U.S. innovation, Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, July 20, 2023. The United States enjoys a status as a global leader in business, with 621 of the 2,000 largest global publicly traded companies, according to Forbes, and is home to a disproportionately high number of very large, highly productive companies or superstars.5Hank Tucker, âInside the Global 2000: United States grows more dominant among worldâs largest companies,â Forbes, June 13, 2024; âSuperstars: The dynamics of firms, sectors, and cities leading the global economy,â McKinsey Global Institute, October 24, 2018. However, when it comes to small business productivity on a global scale, US MSMEs are comparatively average. US small businesses, in purchasing-power-parity terms, are roughly on par with those in the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, and Italy. Among the ten advanced economies we studied, small companies are, on average, 60 percent as productive as big businessesâbut US small companies are just 47 percent as productive (Exhibit 4). Small business productivity varies by sector. While, on average, US MSMEs are on par with those in the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, and Italy, they lag in a few sectorsâmining, transportation and storage, and administrative services. Additionally, they trail in some technology subsectors such as computer programming and some manufacturing subsectors such as basic metals, machinery and equipment, and furniture. The productivity ratio relative to large companies also varies by sector. In the United States, it ranges from 35 percent in mining to 88 percent in the administrative-services sector (Exhibit 5). In other words, MSMEs in the mining sector face the widest gap in productivity relative to their large peers in the same sector, closely followed by information and communications technology (ICT) and manufacturing. On the other end, MSMEs in administrative services come closest to performing as productively as their large peers. In fact, in a few sectorsâadministrative services, professional services, transportation and storage, and retail and wholesale tradeâmedium-size businesses with 50 to 499 employees perform at the same level or even better than large companies (with more than 500 employees). But, apart from accommodation and food, microenterprises with ten employees or less and small enterprises with ten to 49 employees are less productive than medium-size enterprises, which are on average twice as productive. Overall, the gap widens as the company size gets smaller. The vast productivity gap can be partially explained by differences in the kind of work undertaken by small and large businesses. Small businesses play a crucial role in enabling the productivity of large companies, which tend to focus on core competencies and outsource less essential activities to other businesses, a phenomenon called work fissuring.6David Weil, âUnderstanding the present and future of work in the fissured workplace context,â Russell Sage Foundation Journal of the Social Sciences, 2019, Volume 5, Number 5. This results in greater concentration of higher-value-added activities in large companies, with smaller businesses taking on lower-value work. But ultimately, the productivity ratio depends on advantages of scale in areas such as technology, human capital, market access, and finance. MSMEs struggle to access these competencies at the same level as larger companies. For example, the share of MSMEs that adopt technologies such as customer relationship management systems and artificial intelligence is only half the share of large companies.7The OECD model survey on ICT usage by businesses: Second revision, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2015. Large companies are twice as likely to provide formal skilling programs and are more active in monitoring performance and awarding performance bonuses.8McKinsey Global Institute analysis of the World Bank Enterprise Survey, 2013â22. MSMEs derive just 5 percent of their total sales from direct exports, which is one-third of the sales made overseas by large enterprises. The share of large businesses using banks for working capital financing is 1.5 times that of small businesses. Consequently, the MSME productivity ratio tends to be lower and the productivity gap wider in sectors where these competencies play a significant role in driving business competitiveness. MSMEs are ubiquitous across all states, but their economic contribution is uneven. On one end are states such as Nevada and South Carolina, where small businesses employ around half the workers and represent about 35 percent of receipts in the business economy. On the other end, in states such as Montana and Vermont, about three-fourths of employment is in small businesses, generating about 55 percent of those statesâ receipts (see sidebar âHow small businesses fared during the COVID-19 pandemicâ). Among the top 40 metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) by employment, small businesses account for between 25 and 50 percent of receipts and between 50 and 70 percent of employment in the business sector (Exhibit 6). The number of new businesses registered each year in the United States increased dramatically during the pandemic. Over 2019 to 2021, the number of new businesses registered increased by 54 percent. However, while new businesses were registered, existing businesses closedâand their numbers appear to be in balance. The net number of micro-, small, and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs) increased by only 6 percent between 2019 and 2021 (exhibit). On the other hand, despite the number of new business registrations growing only by 10 percent in the prepandemic period from 2017 to 2019, the net number of MSMEs grew by 4 percent, and their employment also increased by 3 percent. A relatively higher number of MSMEs appear to have survived during this period. Despite the significant increase in new business registrations during the pandemic, these businesses did not generate proportionate employment, with the net workforce in MSMEs falling in half the states over 2019 to 2021. On average, the number of MSME workers fell by 1 percent in the United States. The proportion of workers employed by MSMEs stayed stagnant for the most part. This suggests that the industry structure might be gradually changing, with some small businesses growing into large companies, or more employees moving from smaller to larger companies, transitioning to more productive work. Overall, this is the right direction of movement for the United States. This variation in the economic contribution of MSMEs across states and MSAs is also reflected in their performance, measured as receipts per worker as a proxy for productivity. Some of these differences could be attributable to differences in price levels across states. Clearly, states with higher prices might generate higher receipts per worker than states with lower prices, independent of any true differences in performance. So to compare the true performance of MSMEs across regions, we measured the receipts that MSMEs generate for every worker in each state and in the top 40 MSAs by employment, adjusted for regional price parity.9Micro-, small, and medium-size enterprise receipts per worker for each state and each metropolitan statistical area (MSA) are adjusted to account for the differences in price levels of goods and services, using regional price parities (RPPs) sourced from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis. RPPs are calculated using expenditure data from the consumer price index, which is aggregated into broader expenditure categories and then allocated across regions using a multilateral aggregated method that expresses a regionâs price level relative to the United States. RPPs may not completely reflect the extent of price differentials within a state or MSA, particularly in areas with significant economic disparities. Across sectors, MSMEs are assumed to generate revenue locally within the state, while large companies are assumed to generate revenue globally, nationally, or regionally.10As a result, we adjust micro-, small, and medium-size enterprise (MSME) receipts per worker, depending on regional price parities in a state or metropolitan statistical area, but do not adjust large-company receipts. We adjust for all sectors equally. This approach has drawbacks in sectors such as mining, manufacturing, and information and communications technology, wherein a sizeable share of MSME revenue generation might be nonlocal. We estimate that this limitation could imply, approximately, a 15 percent variation around the mean. Similar limitations apply to large companies that might primarily generate receipts locally in certain sectors, such as a large restaurant chain only operating in a few states. MSME performance varies significantly across states (Exhibit 7) and MSAs (Exhibit 8). Their performance goes hand in hand with large-company performance. In general, where large companies perform better or poorer than the national average, so do MSMEs, and vice versa. MSME performance relative to large companies is concentrated within a narrow band. In more than 30 states with 70 percent of all MSME employees, small business receipts per worker are 45 to 55 percent that of large businesses. However, among the top 40 MSAs, there is a larger variation. The same relative performance band of 45 to 55 percent comprises only 15 MSAs, accounting for only 30 percent of employment. So why do MSMEs in some states and metros perform better than others? Reasons could include differences in the business environment and policies. Some states have tax, regulations, and compliance systems that support the expansion of large and small companies alike. Some states have more deeply ingrained business networks, greater availability of financing, and a concentration of talent, which provide a boost to MSMEs that struggle to access these competencies. Capturing the MSME productivity potential is vital for US competitiveness amid a changing world: geopolitical shifts, net-zero transitions and the rise of the green economy, and greater healthcare needs for an aging population, along with the developments in gen AI (see sidebar âHow generative AI can propel small businessesâ). There is already a tech adoption divide between large and small businesses. The share of micro-, small, and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs) that adopt technologies such as customer relationship management systems and artificial intelligence is only half the share of large companies. However, there is scope for democratization of tech access with recent AI developmentsâmuch of the new software targeted at small businesses is expected to have AI, and even generative AI (gen AI), embedded in them. Such gen-AI-enabled products and services can be used with natural-language prompts, rather than advanced IT skills. This democratization makes AI more accessible to small businesses, but also raises the cost of nonadoption. It can potentially create a divide between small businesses that embrace technology and those that donât. For example, if previously the difference between a business that adopted technology and one that didnât was creating email marketing campaigns versus printing marketing flyers, now the difference will be the tech-friendly MSMEâs ability to launch substantial digital marketing campaigns with a simple prompt, with the ability to analyze the effectiveness of the campaigns and tweak them easily. The productivity lift for such a company could be considerable. The effective use of data will rise in importanceâand small businesses can struggle with this, from both a scale and sophistication point of view. Small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) often have a wealth of data, and gen AI tools can help them leverage that data to grow their business. So how can small businesses implement these technologies effectively? Here are several trends to consider: Although conditions vary across states and MSAs, the low productivity levels of small businesses are holding back US competitiveness. Narrowing the MSME productivity gap is equivalent to 5.4 percent of GDPÂ (Exhibit 9).11âA microscope on small businesses: Spotting opportunities to boost productivity,â McKinsey Global Institute, May 2, 2024. The tremendous variation in MSME productivity ratios across countries suggests there is ample room for improvement in many sectors in the United States. While meaningful benchmarks vary based on local conditions, we compare the average productivity ratio of MSMEs to that of large US companies with a top quartile ratio across the ten advanced economies we studied at a subsector level. Retail and wholesale trade, manufacturing, construction, and ICT account for the bulk of the productivity opportunity by virtue of their large share of national output and employment. The largest opportunity is in wholesale and automotive tradeâwhich is almost 35 percent. In these sectors, MSMEs in the United States are only 38 percent as productive as large companies, a figure that is low relative to other advanced economies. For example, MSMEs in the automotive-trade sector in Japan are 62 percent as productive as large companies. They are more vertically integrated with large manufacturers, enabling efficient logistics that follow just-in-time principles and respond effectively to market fluctuations.12Christina L. Ahmadjian and Joanne E. Oxley, âVertical relationships, hostages, and supplier performance: Evidence from the Japanese automotive industry,â Journal of Law, Economics, & Organization, 2013, Volume 29, Number 3.Â Similarly, wholesale trade MSMEs in Germany are 83 percent as productive as large companies. They benefit from market-leading innovation and vertical integration with upstream purchasers, such as retail supermarkets or distributors for large manufacturers, across the entire European Union.13Bernhard Dachs et al., EU wholesale trade: Analysis of the sector and value chains, The Vienna Institute for International Economics Studies research report, number 415, June 2016; Matthias Fauth, Benjamin Jung, and Wilhelm Kohler, âGerman firms in international trade: Evidence from recent microdata,â Journal of Economics and Statistics, 2023, Volume 243, Number 3â4. US businesses can take inspiration from these countries to improve their productivity. Moreover, US manufacturing supply chains are realigningÂ across the electronics, automotive, and pharma sectors, for example. The CHIPS and Science Act offers new spending and opportunity for MSMEs tied to semiconductor manufacturing and R&D.14âFact sheet: CHIPS and Science Act will lower costs, create jobs, strengthen supply chains, and counter China,â The White House, August 9, 2022. In the electronics industry, MSMEs generate 22 percent of value added, accounting for 2 percent of the productivity opportunity. The automotive industry accounts for another 2 percent, which may improve the competitiveness of the American electric-vehicle industry. Additionally, the recent surge in biotech investments is another opportunity for MSMEs. They generate 18 percent of value added in the pharmaceuticals, life sciences, and biotechnology sectors, and their productivity opportunity accounts for 2 percent of the total. A competitive manufacturing economy requires efficient logistics, but in the United States, transportation companies are less efficient than their advanced-economy counterparts. MSMEs in the transportation sector account for 6 percent of the productivity opportunity. As the United States works to rebuild its public infrastructure and improve its supply of housing stock, as well as undertake capital expenditures in building renewable energy infrastructure, there will be an increased demand for construction services, a sector particularly dominated by MSMEs, with significant room for productivity improvement. Twelve percent of the productivity opportunity can come from small businesses involved in construction. The productivity imperative is even more important in the context of labor force shortages in the construction sector.15âHelp wanted: Charting the challenge of tight labor markets in advanced economies,â McKinsey Global Institute, June 26, 2024. Labor market tightness in the United States is among the highest across advanced economiesâmaking it challenging for the US economy to grow through employment alone. Almost three-fifths of job openings in March 2024 wereÂ in states with lower-than-average performance of MSMEs relative to large companies (Exhibit 10). Boosting MSME productivity could enable states to close that labor gap by offering workers higher pay and nonpay benefits, or by reducing hiring needs because they produce the same output with fewer workers. Either way, the small business gains. For small businesses, the road to higher productivity involves accessing four key competencies: technology, human capital, market access, and finance. MSMEs struggle to access these competencies at the same level as larger companies, explaining wider productivity gaps in sectors where they are vital for competitiveness. How can small businesses better develop these competencies? An answer lies in what may seem, at first, an unlikely source: networks and interactions with other, usually bigger, businesses. Business-to-business interactions fuel MSME productivity and help them narrow the productivity gap (Exhibit 11). Businesses large and small should reconsider whether they have an adversarial approach to one another. Policies that attempt to create incentives, quotas, or protections that tilt the balance toward either small enterprises or larger ones arenât necessarily the solution. The truthâbroadlyâis that both MSMEs and large companies can benefit when they are operating within the right economic conditions. Large companies could help smaller companies acquire competenciesâbut itâs not a one-way street. Small companies help large companies as customers, suppliers, and sources of new ideas. In fact, the productivity of large and small companies tends to move hand in hand in most sectors. Boosting interactions between them could raise overall productivity for everyone. Our analysis of a wide cross-section of subsectors across emerging and advanced economies suggests that MSME and large-company productivity move in tandem in most subsectors, indicating spillovers if the right conditions are established. In the United States and in other advanced economies, there are multiple examples of winâwin relationships between MSMEs and large businessesâtemplates for what has already worked. There are four kinds of models: larger companies innovating products and services targeted at helping small companies raise performance, intentional collaborative partnerships between small and large companies, more organically formed regional business clusters, and sector-wide infrastructure designed to boost intercompany connections. Serving small-business customers with offerings that boost productivity. MSMEs could interact with larger businesses as their customers. They could benefit from improving their overall efficiency and ability to invest in more technology and capabilities. Large companies can sell MSMEs productivity-boosting products and services and drive revenue growth. In short, small businesses could gain assets previously unavailable to them, and big companies could grow by selling those assets. Many small businesses have integrated with software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers to automate back-end operations and build capabilities in areas like compliance, tax, and accounting, thereby eliminating the need for people to perform these tasks. For example, a large HR solutions provider created a chat-based app specifically for small businesses to handle payroll. Another provider supports small businesses in hiring and onboarding. Other such collaborations help small businesses outsource managerial tasks, saving time for the owners at a fraction of the cost of a full-time employee, including tools for writing business plans, cloud-based project management tools, calendar tools for tracking time and building itineraries, and virtual assistants that record conversations, transcribe interviews, and generate summaries. MSMEs have also collaborated with other companies to expand their market reach, by utilizing products that enable them to accept digital payments, create content for marketing, and run an effective ad campaign. MSMEs are also integrating with providers to manage their finances in real time, seamlessly connecting with banks, accountants, and other business applications. And larger companies are using these digital footprints, such as merchant point-of-sale transactions, to enhance small business credit scores, helping businesses that might not otherwise qualify for financing. Collaborative partnerships fostered through supply chains. Collaborations between large and small companies can generate mutual benefits. Partnerships help larger businesses by giving them added resilience and flexibilityâthey also help MSMEs by building know-how, human capital, and market access. For example, in advanced-manufacturing industries, which require inputs from multiple suppliers such as semiconductors, automotive, and wind turbines, close collaboration between large integrators and suppliers helps suppliers reach new markets. Some contractual partnerships between Toyota and its suppliers have lasted for more than 30 years. Toyota has directly involved itself in raising the operational standards of its partners through knowledge transfer, from demand planning and cost reduction to raising management capabilities.16StÃ©phane Heim, âCapability building and functions of SMEs in business groups: A case study of Toyotaâs supply chain,â International Journal of Automotive Technology and Management, 2013, Volume 13, Number 4. IBM, in collaboration with other Fortune 500 companies, launched the Supplier Connection initiative that connects small suppliers to one another and to large businesses to access new opportunities.17Freddie Pierce, âIBM launches new Supplier Connection portal,â Supply Chain Digital, May 17, 2020. One study of small businesses in New York found that seven in ten of them increased their revenue within two years of becoming part of a corporate supplier base.18Giving small firms the business, Center for an Urban Future, March 2011. Sharing technology is a big part of the benefit. In the consumer-packaged-goods industry, large companies have improved the efficiency of fragmented suppliers by providing advanced digital and analytics tools that smaller companies do not have. The Global Lighthouse Networkâa World Economic Forum initiative in collaboration with McKinseyâhas identified multiple companies that have achieved productivity improvements of up to 250 percent in some factories.19Global Lighthouse Network: Adopting AI at speed and scale, World Economic Forum, December 2023. Some companies have focused on lifting the capabilities of the small business workforce through training programs that help them succeed as suppliers. One exampleÂ is Appleâs $50 million fund to provide learning and skills development opportunities for the employees of its suppliers, launched in collaboration with the International Labour Organization and the International Organization for Migration.20âApple launches $50 million Supplier Employee Development Fund,â Apple press release, March 30, 2022. Another is NestlÃ©âs Nescafe Plan, which has provided training to small coffee farmers on techniques to increase crop yields.21Mark Segal, âNestle commits over $1 billion to sustainable coffee farming plan,â ESG Today, October 4, 2022. Finally, small companies can gain financial access by working with bigger companies. Some large companies use their relationships with financial institutions to advocate for small suppliers who may otherwise be unable to access credit or who may receive unfavorable rates. In Colombia, DuPont used its relationship with a financial institution to secure working capital credit for its MSME suppliers in rural areas. This, in turn, strengthened their supply chain and stabilized procurement.22Partnerships for small enterprise development, United Nations Industrial Development Organization, 2009. Vibrant, organically formed business clusters of large and small companies. In some industries and areas, such as Silicon Valley or the furniture industry in Grand Rapids, Michigan, small and large companies have formed regional networks of people, ideas, and financing. Small companies gain from concentrations of capital and talent drawn to the area by universities and large companies. Large companies gain from the innovation and entrepreneurialism of smaller ones (for example, through acquisitions). In Sacramento, a different kind of cluster has developed. Like Silicon Valley, the Sacramento cluster boosts the areaâs natural advantages by connecting large businesses, start-ups, academic research, and private capital. But the Sacramento agtech cluster replaces silicon chips for wine grapes, synthetic proteins, and irrigation systems.23âIndustries: Agri-food techâ Greater Sacramento Economic Council, accessed on September 20, 2024. People add capabilities, too. Drawn by the University of California (UC), Davis, which has a strong agricultural science department, large companies conduct biotech research in the area; the concentration of research labs, educated labor force, and expertise gives small start-ups an advantage over similar-size competitors. One example is Scout, a vineyard management start-up founded by a tech executive and a professor at UC Davis.24Vince Vitale, âNapa-based AI for vineyards closes $3 million in funding,â Press Democrat, April 9, 2024. The Sacramento cluster also provides infrastructure and financial access to MSMEs. Foodtech and agtech start-ups have access to wet labs, lab space, and manufacturing spaces that are set aside specifically for agtech start-ups. AgStart, a nonprofit, provides lab equipment, a commercial-grade kitchen, and event centers and has incubated more than 20 start-ups. mall businesses have gained access to capital, either through acquisition by another company, venture capital involvement, or public sector grants earmarked for developing the area. Sector-wide infrastructure designed to boost intercompany connections. Collaboration among companies could be encouraged by enhancing digital data and financial infrastructure, establishing a training ecosystem and creating a level playing fieldâin turn, fueling productivity for small businesses. An open data framework, for instance, could enable financial institutions to use nontraditional data sources for credit underwriting, targeted at a range of underfinanced companies, including MSMEs. An Experian study showed that including utility data allowed 20 percent of âthin fileâ credit customersâthose with scant documentation to support their credit applicationsâto become âthick fileâ customers who have higher loan approval rates.25Let there be light: The impact of positive energy-utility reporting on consumers, Experian, November 24, 2014. A focus on boosting technical competence can enable growth among all companies, small and large. For example, while national labs are mandated to share research with companies, small companies seldom utilize these resources. Improving marketing efforts and providing incentives could encourage greater participation. Policy makers can play a role in promoting technology adoption. An example of this is Singaporeâs GoBusiness initiative, which provides financial support for all businesses that adopt technology solutions to improve their business processes, in line with industry road maps. Establishing a training ecosystem can help MSMEs access crucial technical and strategic expertise. Examples include the United Statesâ Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP), which provides small businesses with access to a national network of hundreds of specialists, who offer services ranging from supply chain management to industrial design, technology-driven market intelligence, marketing and sales, and more. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which administers MEP, estimated that the program interacted with more than 36,000 small manufacturers in 2023, helping to create or retain more than 100,000 jobs.26âMEP economic impacts boost business and jobs,â National Institute of Standards and Technology, April 1, 2024.Â For every dollar of federal investment, it also generated nearly $25 in new sales growth and $28 in new client investment, with a cumulative cost savings of nearly $3 billion.27âManufacturing Extension Partnership: About NIST MEP,â National Institute of Standards and Technology, updated February 9, 2024. Greater collaborations among MSMEs can also raise productivity through knowledge sharing, mentoring, networking, and collectively benefiting from investments. Business leaders and policy makers can join forces to create a pathway to greater MSME productivity. Small businesses can start the process by working with one another. There are three main considerations that could shape stakeholder actions: create a winâwin economic fabric, adopt a granular and tailored approach, and foster networks and connections. In many ways, what spurred the Napa wine industry to world-class status can happen across industries and regions in the United States. Just as Napa vintners shared resources and, in some cases, partnered with bigger wineries, industries as disparate as retail and construction can also use the tools afforded by existing, bigger players in their sectors. Pushing productivity among MSMEs is essential as the United States seeks to remain a global economic powerhouse. Indeed, many of todayâs great American companies have humble beginnings. Nurturing a new crop of small American businesses will keep the US economy vibrant, its workforce growing, and its status strong for seasons to come.
