ByJosipa Majic Predin ByJosipa Majic Predin, Contributor. SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 06: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks during the OpenAI DevDay event ... More on November 06, 2023 in San Francisco, California. Altman delivered the keynote address at the first-ever Open AI DevDay conference. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) The artificial intelligence industry just witnessed one of the most dramatic market distortions in Silicon Valley history. When former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati’s six-month-old startup Thinking Machines Lab successfully raised 2 billion dollars at a 10 billion dollar valuation, it crystallized a fundamental shift in how AI companies compete for talent. But this astronomical funding round isn’t just about one company’s ambitions - it's the direct result of a compensation arms race that began with Meta's desperate hundred-million-dollar recruiting spree. The pattern is unmistakable: Ilya Sutskever’s Safe Superintelligence raised 1 billion dollars at a five billion dollar valuation with no publicly released product. Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab secured 2 billion dollars at a 10 billion dollar valuation for a company that’s existed for just 6 months. These aren’t isolated incidents-they represent the new normal in AI investing, where talent portfolios command unicorn valuations before building anything tangible. The story begins with Meta’s aggressive talent acquisition strategy. According to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta began offering signing bonuses as high as 100 million dollars to poach top researchers from his company. Meta offered employees of rival OpenAI signing bonuses of 100 million dollars to switch companies, with even larger annual compensation packages. While later reports clarified that no one was really getting a hundred million dollar "signing bonus", the psychological impact on the market was immediate and profound. The timing of Meta’s recruitment blitz was strategic. As AI capabilities rapidly advanced and competition intensified, Mark Zuckerberg recognized that talent, not just capital, would determine market leadership. "The List" includes five ex-OpenAI employees as Meta looks to build reasoning models to contend with rivals, highlighting the systematic nature of this talent acquisition campaign. Meta’s compensation strategy created an unintended consequence that reverberated throughout Silicon Valley. When established companies couldn’t match these astronomical packages, they inadvertently set a new baseline for AI talent expectations. Every engineer who heard about hundred-million-dollar offers - even if they didn’t receive them - began to recalibrate their own market value. This is where Murati’s funding round becomes particularly significant. Thinking Machines Lab, the secretive AI startup founded by OpenAI’s former chief technology officer Mira Murati, has closed a 2 billion dollar seed round at a 10 billion dollar valuation. With this valuation, offering 1% equity to a senior engineer effectively provides the same hundred-million-dollar package that Meta was dangling, but with potentially unlimited upside. The mathematics are stark: in a market where top talent expects hundred-million-dollar packages, startups need billion-dollar valuations just to compete. This represents a fundamental shift from traditional equity-based compensation models where early employees accepted lower salaries in exchange for potentially valuable stock options. This phenomenon extends beyond Murati’s success. The venture capital ecosystem has fundamentally shifted its evaluation criteria for AI startups. Traditional metrics like revenue, user growth, and product-market fit have been replaced by team pedigree, publication records, and previous company affiliations. Ilya Sutskever’s Safe Superintelligence exemplifies this trend, raising 1 billion dollars at a 5 billion dollar valuation with no publicly released product or service. The mathematics behind these investments reflect a new understanding of value creation in AI. When a single breakthrough algorithm can generate tens of billions in market value, investors are essentially purchasing lottery tickets with extraordinarily high potential payoffs. The team becomes the product, and their collective expertise represents the company's entire value proposition. The current landscape reveals clear winners and losers in this talent war. Established tech giants like Meta, Google, and Microsoft can absorb massive compensation costs as operating expenses. Well-funded AI startups with venture capital backing can inflate their valuations to offer competitive equity packages. However, mid-sized companies and traditional enterprises find themselves increasingly priced out of the AI talent market. The pattern is consistent across multiple high-profile cases. Companies like Safe Superintelligence and Thinking Machines Lab represent a new category of “talent unicorns” - startups valued primarily on their human capital rather than their technological assets. This shift forces traditional businesses to compete not just on product features or market positioning, but on their ability to attract and retain the small pool of elite AI researchers who command these premium valuations. The AI talent market now operates under fundamentally different rules than the broader tech industry. While traditional software companies might offer senior engineers packages worth two hundred thousand to five hundred thousand dollars annually, AI companies routinely offer multimillion-dollar packages for similar roles. This disparity creates several strategic challenges for companies across the ecosystem. First, it forces non-AI companies to either dramatically increase compensation or risk losing technical talent to AI-focused competitors. Second, it creates internal equity issues when AI engineers command significantly higher compensation than equally skilled colleagues in other domains. The talent war has also accelerated the trend toward specialized AI roles. Companies are no longer just hiring "software engineers" but specifically recruiting "AI researchers," "ML engineers," and "AI safety specialists" at premium rates. This specialization further fragments the talent pool and drives up costs. Beyond individual companies, this compensation inflation has broader economic implications. It concentrates high-skilled talent in a narrow set of companies and geographic regions, potentially limiting innovation in other sectors. The astronomical valuations required to compete for AI talent also create potential bubble conditions, where companies are valued based on their ability to attract talent rather than their actual business prospects. The phenomenon also raises questions about resource allocation efficiency. When companies spend billions primarily to secure talent rather than develop products, it suggests that the current market structure may be creating significant inefficiencies. OpenAI CTO Mira Murati has reportedly doubled the amount of funding she's seeking to raise for her startup Thinking Machines Lab, indicating that even initial funding targets proved insufficient to compete effectively. The current talent war raises fundamental questions about long-term sustainability. While venture capital markets can support inflated valuations in the short term, companies ultimately need to deliver returns that justify these investments. The pressure to monetize AI capabilities quickly may lead to rushed product launches or over-promising on technological capabilities. Some industry observers argue that the current compensation levels are unsustainable and will eventually correct. However, the unique nature of AI talent—where individual contributors can have outsized impact on company success—suggests that premium compensation may persist longer than in other technology sectors. The international dimension adds another layer of complexity. While US companies engage in bidding wars for AI talent, international competitors may gain advantages by accessing talent pools with different compensation expectations. This could potentially shift the geographic center of AI innovation over time. The AI talent war represents more than just competitive hiring-it reflects the industry's belief that artificial intelligence will fundamentally reshape the global economy. Companies are essentially placing multi-billion-dollar bets on their ability to attract and retain the individuals who will build these transformative technologies. Meta's hundred-million-dollar signing bonuses were intended to solve a specific recruitment problem. Instead, they created a market distortion that forced every other AI company to compete at similar levels. Mira Murati's two-billion-dollar funding round at a ten-billion-dollar valuation represents the logical conclusion of this arms race: when talent becomes the primary constraint on growth, companies will pay whatever it takes to secure it. The question now is whether this new paradigm will drive breakthrough innovations that justify the enormous investments, or whether it represents a misallocation of resources that will eventually require correction. Either way, the AI talent war has permanently altered the landscape of Silicon Valley compensation, creating new rules that extend far beyond the artificial intelligence industry itself. For now, one thing is certain: in the battle for AI supremacy, reputable AI talent has become the ultimate currency, and the price of that currency continues to climb.

Title: U.S. stocks close mixed amid tariff uncertainty

Wednesday, 09 Jul 2025 NEW YORK, July 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks ended mixed on Tuesday, as investors weighed escalating trade threats from U.S. President Donald Trump against bullish revisions to Wall Street's outlook for the rest of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 165.60 points, or 0.37 percent, to 44,240.76. The S&P 500 sank 4.46 points, or 0.07 percent, to 6,225.52. The Nasdaq Composite Index increased by 5.95 points, or 0.03 percent, to 20,418.46. Six of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended in red, with consumer staples and utilities leading the laggards by losing 1.09 percent and 1.07 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, energy and materials led the gainers by rising 2.72 percent and 0.53 percent, respectively. Trump reiterated his Aug. 1 deadline for finalizing trade deals, writing in a Truth Social post that "no extensions will be granted." At a Cabinet meeting later in the day, he announced a 50-percent tariff on copper imports, sending copper prices surging 13 percent to a record high. He also floated potential tariffs as high as 200 percent on pharmaceuticals and said he might notify the European Union within two days of new penalties if a deal is not reached. Trump's aggressive tone came on the heels of letters sent Monday to 14 mostly Asian countries outlining duties scheduled to take effect next month. Despite the tough rhetoric, market reaction was relatively muted. "If people believed it, we'd be down several percentage points," said market analyst Tom Essaye. "The fact that we're not means nobody believes it." He noted that while sentiment was extremely bearish in the spring, the market has become vulnerable to negative surprises now that indexes are hovering near all-time highs. In contrast to trade concerns, two major investment banks boosted their year-end S&P 500 targets. Bank of America raised its target to 6,300, citing solid corporate earnings and resilient consumer spending. Goldman Sachs lifted its forecast to 6,600 from 6,100, although chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin warned that the recent tech-driven rally has narrowed market breadth to its lowest level since 2023. In equity moves, major technology shares were mixed. Tesla rose 1.32 percent as the stock rebounded from Monday's drop following news that Tesla CEO Elon Musk launched a new political party. Meta Platforms and Apple inched higher, while Microsoft and Broadcom edged slightly lower. Amazon declined more than 1 percent despite kicking off its Prime Day sales event, and Alphabet also slipped about 1 percent. Nvidia was up 1.11 percent after it got a price target bump from Citi on 'Sovereign AI' demand surge. Market attention is turning to Wednesday's release of the Federal Open Market Committee minutes from the Federal Reserve's June meeting. "This last policy meeting probably was a bit more contentious than the prior meeting in May," said Bob Lang, chief options analyst at Explosive Options. "There probably was a lot of discussion about when the next rate cut is going to be, so that's going to be important to help move markets along." Thank you for your report!

Title: 10 Prime Day Deals We Expect To Sell Out Before Day One Ends

Time Published: 2025-07-08T17:46:53Z

As someone who’s been working as a shopping editor for over six years, I’ve come to know the ins and outs of Prime Day—from spotting genuinely good deals (and avoiding the bad ones) to predicting which products will sell out the fastest. For the first time ever, the sale will span four days, which means stock on popular items may be even more limited than years past. To help you find the best Prime Day deals on day one, I’ve curated a list of hot-ticket items expected to be among the first to go, including the Crest 3D Whitestrips Professional Effects and the Stanley Quencher H2.0 FlowState Tumbler, both of which are at all-time low prices. These are the 10 Prime Day deals our deals editor predicts will sell out on day one. If you come across my curated list a little late (these products do tend to sell out quickly), I recommend heading straight to Amazon’s “Today’s Big Deals” or “Lightning Deals” sections. That’s where you’ll find the steepest markdowns on hundreds of buzz-worthy items. In any case, check out all my editor-approved Prime Day deals for day one before stock runs out. Amazon Any product with a viral following tends to sell out fast during Prime Day—and this Stanley tumbler is one of them. For context, every time the cup is released in a new colorway, stock typically runs out in minutes. So the fact that it’s majorly discounted right now leads me to believe it’ll fly off the shelves before the day (or even next hour) is over. Why It’s A Good Deal: This is the lowest price it’s ever dropped to at Amazon. Amazon Year after year, the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask proves to be a top-seller during Prime Day. If you’re already hooked on its buttery-soft, hydrating formula, this is a good time to stock up. Why It’s A Good Deal: This matches the standard discount we’ve seen during Prime Day in the past. Amazon These whitening strips are another hot commodity during Prime Day—we often see thousands of boxes sell during the sale event. They’re also a team favorite, earning a spot in our shopping guide for the best teeth whitening kits. Why It’s A Good Deal: This matches the lowest price we’ve seen in 2025. Amazon Prime Day is a great opportunity to find steep discounts on popular smartwatch models, like the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7. Track your fitness routine, curate better sleep habits and monitor key stats like energy level and heart rate, all from this sleek design. Why It’s A Good Deal: This is the lowest price the smartwatch has dropped to at Amazon. Amazon Similar to Stanley, Yeti is a popular brand shoppers flock to during major sale events. While plenty of Yeti designs are marked down right now, this portable cooler will come in especially handy during summer—whether you’re lounging at the park or heading to the beach. Why It’s A Good Deal: This is the first time this Yeti cooler has gone on sale at Amazon. Amazon If you’ve got your eye on electronics from top brands, it’s best to check out sooner rather than later. These Bluetooth headphones are a frequent best-seller on Amazon—over 2,000 pairs were sold in the last month alone—so they’ll likely go quickly while they’re discounted to an all-time low price. Why It’s A Good Deal: This is the best deal we’ve ever spotted on the earbuds at Amazon. Amazon In all my years covering Prime Day, I’ve noticed Apple AirPods 2 (alongside other models from the brand) are always among the first to sell out. It’s no surprise—they’re a staple for Apple users, whether they’re upgrading from an older model or replacing a lost pair. Why It’s A Good Deal: This price is $10 cheaper than what we saw over Black Friday. Amazon Nearly all sizes of the Samsung Frame TV—32-inch, 43-inch, 50-inch, 65-inch and 75-inch—are currently sitting at all-time low prices. This is a rare opportunity to finally splurge on the chic, smart TV—there’s no telling when it will go on sale again (or sell out). Why It’s A Good Deal: These are the best discounts we’ve ever come across on this smart TV. Amazon LED face masks are an investment, so it’s often wise to bide your time until a major sale event arrives. The HigherDose Red Light Therapy Face Mask is one of the more popular designs out there—and our top pick for the best LED face mask for comfort. It combines red and near-infrared light to target signs of aging, dullness and uneven tone. Why It’s A Good Deal: This matches the typical discount we’ve spotted during major sale events, including Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Amazon While it might not seem like the steepest markdown at first glance, the Meta Quest 3 hardly ever goes on sale, making this a rare chance to snag the popular virtual reality device. This Amazon-exclusive Cardboard Hero bundle includes the Handiwork Helmet, Handiwork Armor and 1,000 shiny rocks to use in the Gorilla Tag game. Why It’s A Good Deal: This is the lowest price this MetaQuest 3 bundle has dropped to at Amazon.

The Verge’s favorite deals from Amazon’s four-day sales event, from earbuds and video games to robot vacuums and more. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Day one of Prime Day is in the books. The good news? Almost all of the great deals survived the night, and we’re monitoring them all right here in our Prime Day day two post. As such, the post below will no longer be updated. Prime Day, Amazon’s four-day thunderdome of exclusive deals, is here. Outside of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we anticipate this to be the best moment of the year to score discounts on headphones, laptops, TVs, gaming gear, and really anything else that might be on your wishlist — or someone else’s. We sorted through thousands of deals, ultimately narrowing them down to include products we’ve tried (many of which we’ve reviewed) and can vouch for. To repeat, there will be four — count ’em — four days of deals aimed at Prime subscribers, which means you have double the amount of time to save this year. We don’t expect each new day to wipe the slate clean of previous deals and introduce brand-new ones; however, there will likely be some time-sensitive lighting discounts added at intervals throughout, sprinkled on like a garnish. Also, some big retailers outside of Amazon, including Walmart and Best Buy, are also slashing prices, so we’ve added more purchasing options whenever possible. The Sonos Ace are the company’s first set of wireless headphones. They feature a premium, comfortable build and active noise cancellation, along with compatibility with Sonos Arc and other Sonos soundbars. Read our review.

It also runs on Android and comes with the Google Play Store built-in, allowing you to download apps for other digital bookstores, newspapers, note-taking apps, and more. Read our review.

Google’s excellent TV Streamer 4K is its best attempt at a streaming device yet, offering built-in ethernet along with smart home compatibility with Matter and Thread. Read our review. Amazon’s latest streaming stick is faster than its predecessor with Wi-Fi 6E and double the storage. It also now displays widgets and artwork when idle while continuing to offer Alexa integration. LG’s B4 might be one of the cheapest OLED TVs available, but it still offers plenty of bang for your buck — including four HDMI 2.1 ports, speedy performance, and five years’ worth of webOS updates. TCL’s Mini LED QLED TV is a great value, particularly for those who want a fast frame rate and a bright picture. It offers a 144Hz refresh rate, features two HDMI 2.1 ports, and supports Google TV’s robust software. Samsung’s art-inspired 4K TV uses an anti-glare matte QLED display, which can showcase artwork and photos with canvas-like quality when idle. Bargain hunters seeking a large, yet reasonably priced, 65-inch OLED TV should consider Samsung’s S85D. It’s Samsung’s entry-level model, though you still get HDMI 2.1 ports, 4K resolution at 120Hz with consoles, and a variable refresh rate. iFFALCON’s slim-bezeled mural TV takes after Samsung’s Frame TV, but costs significantly less. The TCL sub-brand’s TV sports an art mode and several high-end features, including a 144Hz refresh rate for gaming. Alienware is a major player when it comes to OLED monitors. This 27-inch 360Hz model hits the sweet spot in terms of screen resolution, features, and — most importantly — price. This ultrawide (21:9) QHD OLED gaming monitor has a 165Hz refresh rate, a fast response time, and a slick design. It’s tough to get more OLED for your money than with this model when it’s discounted. The newer Echo Spot is an excellent smart alarm clock with decent sound for its size and no camera. It features Amazon’s smart voice assistant for voice control and is worthy of a spot on your nightstand. Read our review. If you’ve ever wished you had a robot that could push a button for you, that’s precisely what the SwitchBot Bot does. It’s simple, smart, and works on anything with a button. Stick it on the device you want to turn on or off, and you’re set. The newest Echo Show 5 is just as small as its predecessor but features updated mics and a speaker system that delivers double the bass and clearer sound quality. Meross makes a handy add-on that can transform a variety of garage door models into smart doors that you can open remotely. It works with Amazon Alexa, Apple Home, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings. Developed in partnership with Resideo, the Amazon Smart Thermostat allows you to control the temperature of your home through Alexa voice controls and remotely via an app. Read our review. The Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Pro delivers high-quality video with adjustable, accurate radar-powered motion detection, 2,000 lumens of light, and a good digital zoom. It offers smart alerts for people or motion and works with Amazon Alexa, Samsung SmartThings, and Ring’s excellent app. This is a great battery-powered buzzer with excellent video quality, a good head-to-toe view, and very speedy response times for a battery doorbell. It integrates well with Amazon Alexa and can record locally to a Ring Alarm Pro, but the battery only lasts about two months unless you turn on battery-saving features. The fifth-gen Echo Dot touts a temperature sensor, better sound, and faster response time than the prior model. It can also act as an extender for your Eero Wi-Fi system. Read our review. Amazon’s apt-titled Smart Plug doesn’t require a hub and lets you add Alexa functionality to any outlet, allowing you to control a range of devices with just your voice. These smart lights have beautiful colors, a nice selection of festive scenes, and an easy-to-use app. They are super reliable when paired with a Hue Bridge and also work over Bluetooth. They come in two lengths, work with all the major smart home platforms, and are Matter-compatible. With top-notch vacuuming performance, an easy-to-use app, and built-in voice control, the S8 MaxV Ultra is a superb vacuum and good mop which is why it’s our top pick overall. It features Roborock’s best obstacle avoidance, innovative features like dirt detection, and a hands-free dock that makes it an expensive but excellent choice. With a neat ability to remove and reattach its mop pads, the Dreame X40 solves the problem of vacuuming carpets (with 12,000Pa suction power) while also mopping hard floors. Its mops can also swing out and under low furniture, getting where most bots can’t reach. The X10 is a great robovac with excellent AI-powered obstacle detection, powerful oscillating mops, a user-friendly app, and good mapping capabilities. Our favorite budget-friendly robot vacuum offers high-end features, including room-specific cleaning, a capable mop, carpet boost, and smart navigation. It also features an auto-empty dock. The Sonos Beam (second-gen) is a compact soundbar that supports Dolby Atmos and can stream music from a plethora of services. Read our review. Vizio’s Elevate SE is a budget-friendly alternative to its high-end Elevate soundbar. It still features many of the same highlights, though, including booming sound quality and rotating speakers that provide the verticality required for Dolby Atmos content. Ultimate Ears’ latest disc-shaped Bluetooth speaker is small and affordable, with a built-in strap for attaching it to your belongings. It also charges via USB-C and features an IP67 rating against dust and water, along with up to 12 hours of battery life. The last-gen JBL Go 3 may not be quite as powerful as larger models in JBL’s current lineup, but it remains a great pool-ready Bluetooth speaker that can fit in your pocket. If you’ve ever wanted a Bluetooth speaker that looks like a guitar amp, Marshall’s Acton III is one of the best. It’s got tactile switches and knobs out the wazoo, letting you fine-tune the bass and treble, along with the option to plug in a 3.5mm source or use Bluetooth for playback. The WiiM Mini makes it easy to wirelessly stream music from your phone, a streaming service, or other local storage to existing speakers you already have. It supports AirPlay 2 and a variety of streaming services. Sonos’ Era 100 smart speaker is a replacement for the older Sonos One, utilizing two tweeters (left and right) and one larger woofer. In addition to Wi-Fi, the Era 100 also supports Bluetooth audio and line-in playback via an optional 3.5mm to USB-C adapter. Read our review. The JBL Authentics 300 is one of only a few smart speakers on the market with simultaneous Google Assistant and Alexa support. The ’70s-style speaker is heavy, but it produces impressive, powerful sound, especially at louder volumes. Read our review.

It does in the Nex Playground, an all-in-one, motion-controlled console filled with kid-friendly games. Exhaust and entertain your little ones. You’re welcome. This affordable kit includes two glossy screen protectors for the Nintendo Switch 2 that are very easy to install on the system. The G Pro X Superlight 2 is Logitech’s lightest and most advanced mouse to date. It features a 32,000 DPI Hero 2 sensor and 4kHz polling rate, as well as support for USB-C charging and Logitech’s Powerplay mouse mat. For something cheaper — and in some ways better — than Nintendo’s official Pro controller, there’s 8BitDo’s Ultimate 2, which works with the original Switch and Switch 2. It features TMR joysticks with trigger switches for adjusting the feel, as well as vibration and motion control support. Sony’s wireless gaming buds offer low latency, active noise cancellation, and support for both Bluetooth and USB-C. The Insta360 Link 2 offers the same auto-swiveling design as its predecessor, but it’s smaller and offers a slate of new features, including group tracking and no-follow zones. The MK.2 version of the standard Stream Deck comes with 15 programmable buttons, a swappable faceplate, and a detachable stand. A teleprompter is a luxury. They help you make it look effortless to look at your camera as you read from a script or a chat log. Elgato’s option includes a small screen and a mirror, the latter of which allows you to see what you need to look at without breaking eye contact with viewers. Samsung’s ultrafast 990 Pro is a PCIe 4.0 M.2 NVMe SSD that can reach sequential read speeds of 7,450MB/s and write speeds of 6,900MB/s. It’s more than capable for high-end PC builds, and its preinstalled heatsink means it’s easily installable into a PlayStation 5. Its heatsink even has a bit of RGB lighting for some extra pop (if you’re able to see it). The Keychron V1 is one of the best entry-level wired mechanical keyboards available. It has hot-swappable switches, full remappability with VIA, great build quality, RGB backlighting, and double-shot PBT keycaps for under $100.

Furbo’s rotating 1080p gadget can fling treats on command and automatically track your pet as they roam around your home, allowing you to keep a closer eye on your pet via a mobile app when you’re away. Slice’s retractable, finger-friendly ceramic blade is great for tearing through packing tape and cutting plastic wrapping. The comfy tool also features a sturdy, reinforced nylon handle and a hooked design that makes it easy to stow when not in use. LifeStraw’s basic filter removes unwanted viruses, bacteria, and microplastics as you drink, giving you a safe way to hydrate no matter where you are. Lego’s brick-ified replica of an Imperial Star Destroyer is an excellent 1,555-piece throwback to Star Wars: A New Hope, one that comes with seven minifigs, plenty of interior detail, and a convenient handle for carrying it around the room. The ChomChom is a reusable roller that works great for removing unwanted pet hair from furniture, allowing you to skip lint rollers, vacuuming, and other cleaning tools in a pinch. Bird Buddy’s charming, camera-equipped feeder identifies and snaps shots of each bird that stops by, supplementing its 5-megapixel stills with insightful facts via an app. The pocketable HoverAir X1 keeps things simple, with a 2.7K at 30fps max resolution and six preset flight modes for easy, hands-free shooting. It lacks GPS and obstacle avoidance, but it launches in seconds and is easy to use. Look, a carpet cleaner is not a very Verge-y gadget. But we’ve all got carpets and / or upholstery to keep clean, right? Luckily, Bissell’s relatively compact cleaner does a great job of restoring fabrics to their original sheen with just a little elbow grease. This battery has the juice, so to speak, and quite a lot of it. Its main role is to be available to jumpstart a car battery (12V/1000A), but it has USB ports, too, making it handy for charging other devices you bring in the car. The Twelve South AirFly Pro Bluetooth transmitter and receiver features an integrated 3.5mm cord and long-lasting battery life. It can also connect up to two sets of headphones, making it a great choice for listening to in-flight entertainment. The Xreal One aren’t the most affordable augmented-reality glasses available, but they are some of the best for displaying movies and games on the go. You can connect them via USB-C to your smartphone, tablet, or handheld gaming PC. The latest Tile Mate helps you keep track of your personal belongings from up to 350 feet away, which is 100 feet wider than its predecessor’s range. It’s also platform-agnostic, and can send SOS alerts if you pay for the $14.99 monthly Life360 Gold subscription. The Grownsy snot sucker comes with three interchangeable soft tips for a good fit and provides three levels of suction. Your kid might still hate it, but at least one of you will have an easier time with it. The Aura Carver is a lovely, 10.1-inch display that allows you to showcase photos uploaded via the web or a mobile app for Android and iOS. It’s easy to set up, crisp, and keeps unwanted pillarboxing to a minimum. Glocuscent’s rechargeable book light hangs around your neck to illuminate whatever you’re reading, while offering adjustable brightness and warmth settings. Whether you primarily drive a car, motorcycle, or a bicycle, the one thing in common with all three modes of transport is the need for well-inflated tired. This rechargeable 150psi inflator might just save you from a flat (or from being dangerously close to one) when you least expect it. Coway’s surprisingly efficient Airmega AP-1512HH Mighty is compact enough to fit in any corner of your home and offers a three-stage filtration system, including a true HEPA filter. The AeroPress has made a name among enthusiasts for its great brewing ability and extreme portability.

Title: $30 billion blast-off: Why Rocket Lab just hit an all-time high and the 32,000 Kiwis along for the ride

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck at his firm's mission control room in Auckland. Photo / Dean Purcell Rocket Lab shares jumped 9.03% today to US$38.88, giving the Nasdaq-listed, Kiwi-American firm an all-time high valuation of US$17.94 billion ($30.48b). Forbes accordingly bumped founder Sir Peter Beck’s estimated wealth (based on his 10.5% Rocket Lab stake) by 9% or US$164m to US$2.0b on its real-time net-worth tracker. While most of Beck’s wealth is tied up in his firm, he sold a parcel of shares worth US$20.2m in 2023 to capitalise his charitable foundation. The former Fisher and Paykel Appliances apprentice has also invested in numerous Kiwi start-ups at key points in their life, including Halter, Partly, Foundry Lab, Astrix Astronautics and HeartLab. It’s not just about Beck’s bank account, however. When Rocket Lab began its bull run midway through last year, Sharesies said around 20,000 Kiwis owned shares in the firm through its fractional ownership platform. This morning, co-founder Leighton Roberts said the number has hit 32,000. The average buy price in the volatile stock is US$12.76, Roberts says. Sharesies also recently added Rocket Lab to the list of US stocks eligible for its self-select KiwiSaver scheme, which sees customers choose a base fund, with the option to add various individual stocks or exchange-traded funds. “Several hundred” self-select customers had already added Rocket Lab to their KiwiSaver mix, Roberts told the Herald. Rocket Lab’s share price is now running ahead of analysts’ valuations. According to a Wall Street Journal summary, there are 10 analysts with a “buy” rating on Rocket Lab, with one “overweight” and four giving the stock a “hold”. None of the 15 analysts covering the stock have an “underweight” or “sell” rating. The average 12-month target price is US$32.18 (with a low of US$20.00 and a high of US$45.00). Two interrelated factors are behind the stock’s recent surge. One is SpaceX founder Elon Musk’s fallout with Donald Trump - which has seen the US President withdraw the nomination of Musk ally Jared Isaacman to be the new head of Nasa (the US space agency being one of the biggest customers of both SpaceX and Rocket Lab). Trump has also threatened to cancel SpaceX’s Government contracts. At the same time, Rocket Lab is building up to the first test launch of its much larger, crew-capable rocket, the Neutron - which will put it toe to toe with SpaceX for the first time. Rocket Lab has started to sign up the first Neutron customers to its US$1b-plus order book, which was opened after the US election in late 2024. Key clients, including various defence agencies, want competition. Things looked darker as Musk emerged as Trump’s right-hand man, at the same time as SpaceX was pushing for billions more in Federal funding. Now, the stars are more aligned to Beck’s firm. While Neutron will only launch from the US, the giant new rocket forms only half of Rocket Lab’s growth story. The firm is also banking on further growth in its space systems business, including satellite components being manufactured at its expanded Auckland facility. In April, the Wall Street Journal reported that SpaceX - buoyed at the time by Musk’s then-close relationship with Elon Musk - had a US$350b private equity valuation. Beck’s company is the only other private player to stage regular launches, but Musk’s firm is still far ahead. SpaceX, which also owns the Starlink satellite network, staged 138 launches in 2024 to Rocket Lab’s 16. Jeff Bezos’ New Origin - currently best-known for its near-space tourist jaunts - is also gearing up for a medium-lift push. Things have also turned out better than originally anticipated for US solar and wind farm operator Longroad Energy, 37% owned by NZX-listed Infratil. Jarden analysts said the final form of Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill” was less bad for the clean energy sector than Infratil had anticipated. Arie Dekker and Grant Swanepoel maintained their buy rating and hiked Infratil’s 12-month target price from $10.77 to $14.31 (shares were recently trading at $10.96 (other recent developments have included a 1% fall in CDC’s independent valuation and chief executive Jason Boyes buying $1.25m worth of stock). The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which provided US$369 billion ($621b) to spur green infrastructure and decarbonisation, was a Biden centrepiece. Trump campaigned on a promise to gut the legislation, which he called “the green scam”, and withhold US$104b in IRA funds yet to be allocated. In its last annual report, written before Trump’s election, Infratil took a punt on political commentary. “More than 80% of the investment in large-scale clean energy and semiconductor manufacturing pledged since the passage of the IRA and the Chips and Science Act will go to Republican congressional districts. Even if Republicans controlled the Federal government, many in the party may view reversing the IRA as too politically risky.” That turned out to be largely prescient. The original “Big Beautiful Bill” gave energy firms 60 days after its passing to begin new projects, thus securing IRA tax credits. Now, after watering down in the Senate, the final “Big Beautiful Bill” gives Longroad and its peers 12 months to start a new project. It’s a complex set-up but Jarden’s read is that Longroad and its peers will be able to “safe harbour” or claim full IRA tax credits until “well beyond 2027″. For Boston-based Longroad - Infratil’s third-largest asset after CDC and One NZ, with a $2.1b fair value - those new projects will include a contract with Meta, signed in December, to supply the Facebook owner with 1.3 gigawatts (GW) of renewable electricity to support its data centre operations. It’s a similar story for Allbirds, with its Trump impact bad, but a lot less bad than it initially seemed. In May, Allbirds - the producer of sustainable footwear and activewear made from New Zealand merino wool, co-founded by ex-All White Tim Brown - reported another big loss and another big fall in revenue. But it forecast a return to revenue growth in the final quarter of this year, subject to no more external shocks - and Vietnam, home to nearly all of its manufacturing, succeeding in keeping tariffs on its exports to the US at a 10% “pause” level, rather than the 46% initially slapped on the country on Trump’s “Liberation Day”. A US-Vietnam preliminary trade deal announced overnight set a 20% tariff for Vietnam imports (compared to a pre-Trump average of 10%). Allbirds had braced for the worst, announcing a new US$75m revolving credit facility on June 30. The firm had no immediate statement but its need to draw on the new credit line seems less pressing now than anticipated. Its shares, which dived to US$4.39 after “Liberation Day” have staged a sharp recovery over recent weeks and were recently trading at US$10.54.

CASE ALLEGATIONS: DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. provides media effectiveness platforms that help advertisers optimize digital ad performance. According to the class action lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose material facts, including that: (i) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting ad spending away from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the company’s technological capabilities were limited and faced direct competition from native tools offered by platforms such as Meta and Amazon; (ii) developing DoubleVerify’s technology for these closed platforms was far more costly and time-consuming than represented to investors; (iii) monetization of Activation Services on closed platforms would take several years, contrary to defendants’ suggestions; (iv) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to implement AI solutions on closed platforms, impairing DoubleVerify’s competitiveness and profitability; (v) the company systematically overbilled customers for ad impressions served to known bots operating from data center server farms; and (vi) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially misleading by presenting already occurring issues as hypothetical risks. The lawsuit further alleges a series of corrective disclosures that negatively impacted the company’s stock price: February 28, 2024: DoubleVerify issued lower-than-expected Q1 2024 revenue growth guidance, citing a “slow start by brand advertisers” and slow onboarding of new customers. On this news, the stock dropped over 21%. May 7, 2024: DoubleVerify cut its full-year 2024 revenue outlook, attributing the change to reduced ad spending by customers.

Title: Can Nvidia Stock Hit $200 By The End Of 2025?

BySasirekha Subramanian BySasirekha Subramanian, Contributor. Any dip in Nvidia stock is most likely a buying opportunity. This article isn’t about Nvidia’s parabolic rise amid the AI boom. It won’t dwell on the well-known fact that Nvidia’s GPUs power roughly 90% of AI data centers worldwide or that tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta remain deeply invested in its silicon innovations. It’s not even about CUDA, Nvidia’s giant competitive moat that is still relevant today. Nor will we focus on how the stock struggled earlier this year, as investors kept raising the bar, until even spectacular results weren’t good enough. And yet, Nvidia has not only reclaimed its top spot, it is trading at record highs. The trillion-dollar question now is: Can Nvidia stock reach $200 by year-end? Or is that a stretch even for a strong compounder like the AI bellwether? On June 25, 2025, Nvidia surged over 4%, closing at a record $154.31, reclaiming its spot as the most valuable publicly traded company (~$3.77 trillion market cap), surpassing Microsoft and Apple. The stock is even higher now, and the last closing price is $159.34, marking a stellar comeback, from Nvidia’s April 4th closing low of $94.30. Nvidia stock erased more than 40% of its value between February and April of this year, not because of any failing on its part. Concerns over moderating AI spending, and unpredictable tariff policies triggered the decline. This is not Nvidia’s first rodeo either. Prior to that, DeepSeek revelations in late January created uncertainty about America’s AI dominance, wiping $600 billion off Nvidia’s market value in a single day. The market was simply recalibrating its perception of perfection. While DeepSeek showed promise, it is nowhere in the leagues of an established AI leader like Nvidia. So, the sell-off was unjustified in my opinion. The Nvidia stock bounced back within a month. Last year too, Nvidia shares fell nearly 23% from mid-July through early August, closing August 7th trade at $98.88. The sell-off was triggered by fears that Nvidia’s big tech customers may trim their AI spending budgets. However, Nvidia stock staged a strong recovery of more than 30% from these low levels, closing August 19 at nearly $130. Every time a quality stock drops, the internet floods with "Should you buy the dip?" takes. My view is simple: Study the cause. If the sell-off happened for reasons that can be fixed – go ahead and buy. But if it stems from deeper, structural weaknesses, then walk away. It’s not like there’s only one good stock out there. Nvidia’s deeply integrated AI ecosystem gives it a wide berth over competition, and its innovation remains unsurpassed. Nvidia does not think out of the box, it thinks like there is no box. That said, investor perception is everything when it comes to stock pricing. The recent rally has given reason to hope that the market may be finally waking up to the true value of this stock following a period of inflated expectations and sharp corrections.The fear of missing out (FOMO) is likely to keep the buying pressure active and drive NVDA to at least $180 by the end of this year. Of course, I could be wrong. China is a key market for Nvidia; it represented $17 billion or 13% of Nvidia’s sales for the fiscal year that ended in January. But Nvidia’s market share in the region has weakened dramatically from 95% before 2022, to 50% currently, after U.S. regulators tightened restrictions on selling high-end AI chips to China, citing national security concerns. To comply with the U.S. export curbs, Nvidia has been selling H20 to China. H20 is a watered-down version of its H100 chips with significantly lower computing power. However, in April, the U.S. government tightened restrictions again, reclassifying even the scaled-down H20 as requiring an export license. The decision effectively halted shipments and dealt Nvidia a serious financial blow. CEO Jensen Huang put it bluntly: “The H20 export ban ended our Hopper data center business in China.” Calling the $50 billion Chinese AI chip market “effectively closed to the U.S. industry,” Huang also warned that if U.S. export restrictions continue, more Chinese customers will turn to Huawei's chips. I highlighted this risk in a previous article that flagged both the threat of an H20 ban and Huawei’s preparation for competitive positioning, citing Jefferies and WSJ reports. Nvidia recognized $4.6 billion in H20 revenue prior to April 9, before the new export restrictions kicked in. The financial fallout from the ban was significant. Nvidia wrote down $4.5 billion in unsold H20 inventory for the first quarter, and was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion of what would have been H20-generated revenue. Gross margin fell to 61%, versus the 71.3% it would have reported without the China-related charges. In an interview with the Stratechery podcast in May, Huang also revealed the company had to walk away from an additional $15 billion of sales. The topline guidance of $45 billion for the July quarter, would have been higher by $8 billion, but for the new export restrictions. So, why is there still hope for a China rebound for Nvidia? Nvidia is pivoting swiftly. A Reuters report citing sources familiar to the matter said Nvidia is planning to build a GPU or graphics processing unit for China based on its latest generation Blackwell-architecture AI processors that will be priced at $6,500-8,000, well below the H20’s price range of $10,000-$12,000. The lower price could reflect the new export limits on GPU memory bandwidth – a metric crucial for AI workloads that require extensive data processing. Also, recent developments suggest a thaw in the U.S.’s formerly hardline stance against China, signaling a broader shift in tone This gives rise to a key question: In this more conciliatory phase, is there any possibility that the U.S. could revisit its chip export restrictions to China as well? The New York Times reported on June 27th that China confirmed details of a trade framework with the Trump administration. “China will review and approve applications for the export of controlled items,” China’s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement, and “the United States will correspondingly cancel a series of restrictive measures it has taken against China.” While specifics remain vague, the framework hints at a meaningful de-escalation. The most compelling driver behind this shift? Not a change of heart, just China’s dominance in rare earth elements – critical for semiconductors, robotics and aerospace applications. This accord between the U.S. and China, includes the latter’s commitment to deliver rare earth, in exchange for the U.S. lifting its export curbs on ethane, chip software and jet engines. As trade talks evolve, Beijing is not above deploying its rare earth “Trump card” to reopen access to restricted U.S. AI chip technologies. If the U.S. should revise or relax chip export policies or greenlight a new line of compliant processors, Nvidia could regain access to the highly lucrative market. Such a development would materially bolster the case for Nvidia hitting $200 by year’s end. However, even without China, Nvidia remains on solid footing, thanks to its ability to innovate relentlessly. Nvidia’s growth story is deeply structural, spanning beyond GPUs to hyperscaler ramp-ups, AI factories, sovereign AI, Networking, gaming, cybersecurity and self-driving cars. Nvidia isn’t just firing on all cylinders – it is building entirely new growth engines. Blackwell’s Blockbuster Ramp: In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Nvidia’s data center revenue surged 73% year-over-year (y-o-y) to $39 billion, with compute revenue accounting for $34.2 billion, up 76% y-o-y. At the heart of this explosive growth lies Blackwell, the fastest-ramping architecture in Nvidia’s history. AI Factories and Sovereign AI: As nations seek to build in-country AI infrastructure using Nvidia’s full-stack, Sovereign AI is a solid growth engine for the AI bellwether. Nvidia has sovereign AI deals in place with Saudi Arabia, Taiwan and the UAE. AI factory build-outs are driving significant revenue for Nvidia with deployments at AT&T, BYD, Capital One, Foxconn, MediaTek and Telenor. The count of Nvidia-powered AI factories doubled y-o-y to roughly 100 in the first quarter, with the average number of GPUs powering each factory also doubling in the same period. Nvidia’s new Spectrum-X and Quantum-X silicon photonics switches will enable next-level AI factory scaling to millions of GPUs. These switches offer 3.5x greater power efficiency, 10x higher network resiliency and accelerate customer time-to-market by 1.3x. Other revenue drivers: This brings us to networking, which is shaping up as a critical contributor for Nvidia with first-quarter networking revenue reaching nearly $5 billion, up 56% y-o-y and 64% sequentially. Networking growth was driven by NVLink, with Q1 shipments exceeding $1 billion. Hyperscale customers can now build semi-custom CCUs and accelerators that connect directly to the Nvidia platform with NVLink. Also helping networking growth is the continued adoption of Ethernet for AI solutions. Spectrum X – which is the world’s first Ethernet networking platform for AI – is now annualizing over $8 billion in revenue with deployments across Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud, CoreWeave, Meta, Google Cloud and xAI. For AI-powered cybersecurity – Checkpoint, CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks are using NVIDIA’s AI security and software stack to build, optimize and secure agentic workflows. CrowdStrike, for instance, has achieved 2x faster detection triage with 50% fewer compute resources. Gaming revenue for the first quarter was a record $3.8 billion, up 42% from a year ago and up 48% sequentially, driven by sales of the Blackwell architecture. Professional Visualization revenue, which includes Nvidia Omniverse, rose 19% from a year ago to $509 million, thanks to broader adoption of Ada RTX workstation GPUs, addressing workflows in AI acceleration, real-time graphics rendering and data simulation. Automotive and Robotics revenue rose 72% to $567 million from a year ago, driven by sales of Nvidia’s self-driving platforms. Most recently, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang identified robotics as the company’s next biggest growth opportunity after AI, noting that self-driving cars are likely to be the first major commercial application of this technology. Even at record highs, Nvidia’s stock may not be as expensive as it is touted to be. Some valuation metrics suggest room for upside: Interestingly, those discount levels align closely with the roughly 25-30% upside Nvidia would need to reach $200. That leaves the question less about if Nvidia can reach $200 and more about when investors will be ready to price that in. So, what are analysts saying about the Nvidia stock? Nvidia currently has a “Strong Buy” rating with a 12-month price target of $174 per share. Loop Capital lifted its price target for Nvidia to $250 from $175, while maintaining its "buy" rating. The rating firm’s client note said, "Our work suggests we are entering the next ‘Golden Wave’ of Gen AI adoption and NVDA is at the front-end of another material leg of stronger-than-anticipated demand.” Cantor Fitzgerald maintained a Buy rating with a $200 target, citing robust fundamentals and strong growth expectations through 2025 and especially in 2026. A few Bumps on Nvidia's road to $200 include: Bottom line In my opinion, Nvidia stock is likely to reach at least $180 by year-end, supported by a re-rating in its forward PEG to around 1.47, if market sentiment continues to remain constructive. Key catalysts will be earnings announcements for the rest of the year, but it all boils down to market perception. Nvidia can continue to generate stellar results, and if that fails to align with already-high investor expectations, Nvidia stock could pause or pull back. That said, for the long-term, Nvidia is a structural compounder with deeply embedded growth levers and robust AI tailwinds. Any dip in the stock is most likely a buying opportunity. If there is any change in China export policy, the Nvidia stock could achieve its $180 target even sooner and be well on its way to $200 by year-end.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is upping the ante in the AI business, triggering a bidding war for talent and he’s willing to poach from competitors. Why? Well, like most of us, Mark is in hot pursuit of Godlike super intelligence. pic.twitter.com/0MqEqiiKpK — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) July 4, 2025 Perfectly rational man in a perfectly rational society that has truly mastered rational resource allocation. pic.twitter.com/H58LvHoh7S — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) July 4, 2025 Ed Zitron summed up Zuckerberg’s recent moves and his overall strategy: Mark Zuckerberg paid $14.3 billion for Scale AI, an AI data company, as a means of hiring its CEO Alexandr Wang to run his “superintelligence” team, has been offering random OpenAI employees $100 million to join Meta, thought about buying both AI search company Perplexity and generative video company Runway and even tried to buy OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever’s pre-product “$32bn valuation” non-company Safe Superintelligence, settling instead on hiring its CEO Daniel Gross and buying his venture fund for some fucking reason. When you put aside the big numbers, these are the actions of a desperate dimwit with a failing product trying to buy his way to making generative AI into a “superintelligence,” something that Meta’s own Chief AI scientist Yan LeCun says isn’t going to work. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, my previous subject in this King Idiots of AI mini-series squealed like a stuck pig: pic.twitter.com/LXfthZ4STJ — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) July 5, 2025 I really should quote a little from the NY Times piece I referenced above: In April, Meta released two new versions of Llama, asserting that the models performed as well as or better than comparable ones from OpenAI and Google. To prove its claim, Meta cited its own testing benchmarks. On Instagram, Mr. Zuckerberg championed the releases in a video selfie. But some independent researchers quickly deduced that Meta’s benchmarks were designed to make one of its models look more advanced than it was. They became incensed. Mr. Zuckerberg later learned that his A.I. team had wanted the models to appear to perform well, even though they were not doing as well as hoped, people with knowledge of the matter said. Mr. Zuckerberg was not briefed on the customized tests and was upset, two people said. His solution was to throw more bodies at the problem. Meta’s A.I. division swelled to more than 1,000 people this year, up from a few hundred two years earlier. The rapid growth led to infighting and management squabbles. And with Mr. Zuckerberg’s round-the-clock, hard-charging management style — his attention on a project is often compared to the “Eye of Sauron” internally, a reference to the “Lord of the Rings” villain — some engineers burned out and left. Executives hunkered down to brainstorm next steps, including potentially ratcheting back investment in Llama. In fairness to Meta, the NYT failed to mention that Ahmad Al-Dahle, VP of generative AI at Meta, said that it’s “simply not true” that Meta trained its Llama 4 Maverick and Llama 4 Scout models on “test sets.” And if you can’t trust the fine folks at Meta, who can you trust? But I don’t want to dismiss Zuckerberg too cavalierly. I’m a serial sucker taking things at face value, investing based on business fundamentals and underlying product value, and betting on professional wrestling. He’s a stone playa who read the true nature of this society at a very early age, from The Harvard Crimson, 2003: The creator of the short-lived but popular Harvard version of the Am I Hot or Not? website said he will not have to leave school after being called before the Administrative Board yesterday afternoon. Mark E. Zuckerberg ’06 said he was accused of breaching security, violating copyrights and violating individual privacy by creating the website, www.facemash.com, about two weeks ago. The charges were based on a complaint from the computer services department over his unauthorized use of on-line facebook photographs, he said. Zuckerberg said he will not be forced to withdraw or leave school for any amount of time, but declined to elaborate on whether the board took some lesser action. …“I understood that some parts were still a little sketchy and I wanted some more time to think about whether or not this was really appropriate to release to the Harvard community,” Zuckerberg wrote in an e-mail to The Crimson earlier this month. After taking it down, Zuckerberg decided that criticism of the site was too strong to re-post it. “Issues about violating people’s privacy don’t seem to be surmountable,” he wrote at that point. “I’m not willing to risk insulting anyone.” The site was created entirely by Zuckerberg over the last week in October, after a friend gave him the idea. The website used photos compiled from the online facebooks of nine Houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the “hotter” person. Students were ranked within the general Harvard community and individual Houses according to attractiveness. Zuckerberg hacked into House websites to gather the photos, and then wrote the codes to compute rankings after every vote. The programming and algorithms that made the site function were Zuckerberg’s primary interest in creating it, he said. After creating the website, Zuckerberg forwarded the link to a few friends for advice. But the link then was sent out on several campus group list-serves, and traffic skyrocketed. In the course of one day, the number of visitors quadrupled—by 10 p.m., the site had been visited by 450 people, who voted at least 22,000 times. The part I love about the story above is the way Zuckerberg is the only source quoted. Those Harvard educated journalists are allowed to be awful from the get. She also didn’t report the blog post he put up the night he launched the site: “I’m a little intoxicated, not gonna lie. So what if it’s not even 10 p.m. and it’s a Tuesday night? What? The Kirkland [dorm] facebook is open on my desktop and some of these people have pretty horrendous facebook pics. I almost want to put some of these faces next to pictures of farm animals and have people vote on which is more attractive. By the time of his 2018 congressional testimony Zuck had gotten some press training: Zuckerberg, 33, paused and smirked. “No, congressman. FaceMash was a prank website that I launched in college, in my dorm room, before I started Facebook,” he said. “You put up two pictures of two women and decided which one was the better, more attractive of the two, is that right?” Long asked. Zuckerberg responded, with an emphasis on his youth at the time: “That is an accurate description of the prank website that I made when I was a sophomore in college.” Ok, so he’s always been ruthless, shrewd and openly anti-social but I’m not sure he’s really that smart. Social media had been pioneered by MySpace, Friendster and several other companies long before Zuckerberg allegedly stole the idea for Facebook from classmates. Facebook primarily rose to the top because of three factors: Since launching Facebook, his biggest wins have come from buying budding competitors like Instagram and WhatsApp more than from any internally created ideas. Never forget, this is the same guy who spent $47 billion in five years on “the Metaverse.” He clearly cannot tell a good idea from a bad one. He’s explained his recent AI spending spree to investors (who have no ability to depose him) in April: “The major theme right now, of course, is how AI is transforming everything we do.” At the same time, Meta upped its capital expenditures range for the year to between $64 billion and $72 billion from between $60 billion and $65 billion to reflect more data center investments in AI and potentially higher hardware costs. What Zuckerberg didn’t say then is that he was about to start shelling out mounds of cash to revamp his AI organization. “Mark Zuckerberg is in founder mode and he’s not going to be stopped,” said Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, in an interview on Friday with CNBC’s “Money Movers.” Luria has a buy rating on the stock, but said that to win in AI, Meta needs to be successful with the next round, with the dream team that they’re building.” I had to include the hypersonic quote from D.A. that CNBC featured. I’m sure it made great TV. It wouldn’t be American corporate media if it didn’t feature interchangeable hustlers competing to spout the most ridiculous nonsense in the most simplistic terms. They’re all like a TV sportscaster talking to drunks at noon on a Sunday except with no contract and an urgent need to be invited back right away. Also making me doubt Zuckerberg’s wisdom was his recent, much publicized decision to hire the Ultimate Fighting Championship’s CEO Dana White to be a board member for a reported seven figure stock and cash compensation package. Although there was some logic behind that decision. From The MMA Draw, a publication aimed at investors in the fight sports industry: This well-planned and well-executed attention-getter kicked off Meta’s 2025 with a bang. That’s right, Meta, a company with a $1.59 TRILLION market cap has brought America’s best-known fight promoter (and wife-beater) on their board of directors. The collective “WTF?!?” spawned headlines and social media posts all over the Internet. Based on this round-up of headlines from Google News, the mainstream media already has a theory and it has to do with a certain newly re-elected President celebrating a big anniversary on January 6th. pic.twitter.com/zQb8SgdvWq — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) July 4, 2025 It’s also, according to The MMA Draw, part of Zuckerberg personally rebranding himself for the Trump era: Reason #2: Zuck Is Getting Based 2024 saw Mark Zuckerberg embark on what Arwa Mahdawi of The Guardian called “a wider strategic overhaul of the tech mogul’s public image.” She also explained why Zuckerberg might be doing this: Meta is embroiled in an anti-monopoly lawsuit and is being sued by dozens of states alleging that Facebook and Instagram are exploiting children to boost profits. Far better, don’t you think, that we all talk about how handsome a bearded Zuck would be rather than dwell on Meta’s less attractive business practices? Honestly, it’s been a pretty incredible rebranding campaign for Zuckerberg, scoring wins by showing off his wakeboarding, flag-waving, and beer-drinking mastery. Anyone who remembers Zuckerberg’s pathetic attempt to launch himself as a potential political candidate in 2017 should be impressed by how dramatically he’s improved his PR game. He’s even gotten favorable notice from the Twitter fashion guy. Zuck’s (seemingly genuine) fondness for training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu has been a big part of this rebranding and a great excuse to pal around with Dana White. Zuckerberg been talking up his love for BJJ since at least this 2022 appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience. Mark Zuckerberg on what he loves about BJJ: (It’s) a thing that is both super engaging physically but also intellectually and where you can’t afford to focus on something else. I think (it’s) the perfect thing because if you stop paying attention for one second you’re gonna end up on the bottom. So I’ve just found that is just really important for me in terms of what I do. Being able to maintain my energy level, maintain my focus… then after an hour or two of working out or rolling or wrestling with friends, now I’m ready to go solve whatever problem at work for the day. Zuckerberg has also medaled in a BJJ tournament and at one point even had Dana White calling up the Roman Colosseum looking for the right venue to host a bout between himself and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Naturally with 2020’s Zuckerberg, even the cage fight was vaporware. Caveat: The Market, aka the most effective price discovery system ever invented disagrees. pic.twitter.com/eGqayBw4If — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) July 5, 2025 Veteran political operative and corporate media professional. The dual share structure grants him dictatorial powers at Meta, meaning the guy has Imprimatur to do pretty much what he wants, including torching $47bn on what amounted to little more than a personal obsession with the metaverse, memory-holing that episode, and then lining up hundreds of billions more in his continuing quest for a defining “second act” that will secure his place amongst the pantheon of great innovators (as opposed to being known as the guy who stole the idea for facebook from a friend and has since built his empire on strangling emerging competitors in the crib). He’s as desperate for this second act as Trump is for a Nobel Peace Price. His strategy clearly rests on aggregating the critical inputs for AI supremacy ie data (expect Meta’s family of apps to be harvested for every last bit of training data, user privacy be damned), algorithms (Deepseek’s algorithmic breakthroughs shocked SV titans, including MZ, to their core, hence his poaching spree to build bench strength and an AI intellectual aristocracy within Meta to push forward the frontier of algorithmic discovery, which by the way, given Meta’s history, will likely mean just copying whatever the real frontier players are doing) and compute (data centre build out is the sport of kings and given his profligate pursuit of metaverse supremacy, the man can outspend an army of drunken sailors everyday and twice on Sunday). We sure do live in interesting times. https://youtu.be/_v3KiaAjpY8?feature=shared I would recommend this video in full as it does flesh out the whole notion of how one reinvents themselves (or as this video calls it – becoming a new guy) as part of the broadrler topic. It does address Zuck in particular around 42:37. Zuckerberg and the other techbros are looking several steps ahead, but they’re not great at watching their feet. Hey we saw the movie version, Aaron Sorkin on top of every PMC trend. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_social_network It’s not exactly warm and friendly toward Zuck but does seem enamored of Larry Summers. As for Zuckerberg’s trial and error business model that’s so very much a Silicon Valley thing is it not? Musk blows up a giant rocket and just shrugs. break things Contrast with Zuck against say, Bill Gates who quite famously took others ideas or seriously underpaid in hindsight, either is applicable. Good connections and voila, now IBM has a supplier in Microsoft for their software OS on this new idea called the PC…Mark just took the same steps but got to the wealthy billionaire level much quicker. So much to add about my personal experience but I enjoy many of the films directed or helmed by Fincher. Even the occasional dud or a film he disavowed, Alien 3 being a key example. Speaking of the Facebook/Zuck movie, it was recently rated as the 10th best movie of the 21st century by both fans and critics. I mean, I liked the movie OK, but 10th best of the (quarter) century? Not even close, and I don’t watch that many movies. https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/best-movies-21st-century-new-york-times-films-111414429.html I was listening to a podcast about AI and investing. Regardless of what you think about it, it is getting lots of attention from investors that don’t want to be left out. Meaning if you are not investing in it you look like a fool and they will take their money elsewhere. Never mind what China keeps doing with low cost AI. Whether he’s interested or not, he kinda has to go along with the narrative > Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg Loves To Throw Good Money After Bad #NitPick: Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg Loves To Throw Unearned, Magic Money Made Up Via Market Malfeasance After Bad It’s all Unicorn Rainbow Poop, designed via finacial chicanery to become high powered money. All of it, inflated value made real via stock “money”. That’s why he can pelt it around like tennis balls at a summer carnival trying to win prizes. Ugh. It’s family-blogging tragic when you think about it from the perspective of the public good being laid waste to by the US uni-party. And another “inception” subtext to all this is our collective sanitization of the term “billionaire”, and the notion of “a billion dollars”. And absolutely obscene amount of money that could fuel a thousand lifetimes, sadly made acceptable for one person to have in a single lifetime. #GuillotineWatch lost the last of 3 baby geese. and i stepped on a wire or something in the flooded road(tetanus vaxxed)…so my feets are both wrinkled and one is sorta sore. no other casualties. i am alone with the animals on this place. we’re all good. 23″. since thursday afternoon. 7-7-2025 so heres how it happened for me. july 3rd, afternoon, check weather, as usual. Looks like heavy rain and some flooding…so I decide, after evening chores…critters put up, etc…to sit out at the wilderness bar, drinking beer(started w a margarita(likker first!)) and rolled 4 little joints(lack of proper zigzags), and determined to watch the storm…as is my wont…..my fone is filled with vids of these often dramatic events…usually brief. This event didnt turn out to be brief,lol. When im out here, I have my laptop for music and for occupying myself with the web. And also for weather. First place I go when I get up(4am) is NWS and Wundermap, to see whats happening…and then I do this regularly, all day. So I had all my weather shit in one window…so i’m watching the storms IRL, and on the near real time radar. And a brief, relatively minor event, turned into a catastrophe….storms just sat there, dumping rain by the tankerfull…all over from here to kerrville. (turns out I got the most rain from this event…24” on my place, since thursday afternoon…more than kerr cnty..but I dont live on a river, nor have canyons). So I watched it rain…hard. Threw a tarp over the laptop and retreated(quite drunk and high, mind you) to the spots that generally stay dry. And it just kept on raining, superhard. Im from houston, and ive spent a lot of time in a vw van all over the gulf coast, and ive never seen a monsoon, before, save in films. Thats what this was like…bangladesh. So im out here, 5 sheets to the wind(by now, im sipping tequila…because why the hell not?) watching this incredible monsoon hammer down and I remember thinking, “ well, this aint what they predicted”. So I watched and watched…and soon, I heard a sound that I know well…rushing water…like over a rapids at a river. But way out here. It was the road and my almost always dry gully…which is not connected(for 40 years) to any current drainage system in this watershed. I had a pond…but filled with rushing water, calf-high…and so did the road,,,,and it stayed that way for…well…well into the next day(saturday), and I couldnt get to the highway until sunday. Im 20+ miles from the Llano river, maybe 12 from the San Saba. We do flood, due to the hills…but rarely anything like this. But we dont have canyons…and we have more silt…often deep, between the hills, instead of the limestone caliche that they have down there(about 50 miles as crow flies from me, to my southwest) Its now monday evening, july 7th…and it only stopped raining about 4 hours ago. Ive had some breaks…such to pick squash and zukes and a whole lotta green beans to can…and ive been to the highway, to look at the dirt road…torn up, but passable once the water ran off. That was saturday midday, I think,lol. Maybe sunday///it all runs together. \ive had intervals where I could go out and do farmer things…but then it rains again. I was out in the worst of it…thursday night, all day friday….half of that time drunk as a skunk,,,with a headlight, crocs and naked(why get yer clothes wet?) and checking on the critters….and just surveying what was going on. I am currently alone on this place…mom’s been at galveston for a week now, with my brother and his brood. This is NOT how I wanted to spend my vacation from her,lol. I’ve got a leaky house…due to being bad at roofing,lol…so my house is wet and moldy. Take a week of fans and dry weather to even begin. But I aint in kerrville, or comfort, or any of a thousand little wide spots in the road(and real cities, too) who have had it much, much worse than I. I feel for those folks…and recognise immediately many of the places in all the vids out there. I have lived out here in the texas hill country for 30 and a half years, now. I know this place, this area, this region. In that time, ive seen catastrophic floods…more often than not, along the guadalupe. But ive never seen anything as catastrophic as this. Pray, or send $, or sacrifice a chicken or whatever. A hurricane came to the middle of texas. So glad to hear from you and that beyond some very annoying property damage, you came through OK! We missed your comments. It reminded me of childhood when a tooth came out and before the adult tooth erupted you keep noticing the gap. The mouth is functional but incomplete….. that’s probably a stupid analogy but just woke up. Here in middle England we are supposedly about to enter phase 2 of our summer record breaking heatwave. This time round my dad has been a total star and I have portable A/C unit now fully set up with appropriate window covering for exhaust fan set up. Hardly very environmentally friendly but after attending a meetup group of locals and seeing where the mood of this country is taking us, I don’t feel very inclined to do my bit anymore for the next generation. UK entering FAFO phase. glad you are for the most part ok Was hoping you and your’n were ok… and glad to hear it’s so… Glad you survived, what a storm! What a tale to tell… Glad everything is jake~ Glad to hear that you made it though the storm OK. Lots of people were asking after you the past coupla days and were worried about you. Guess that you have a boat load of repairs and work to do now that the storm has abated. You wonder if this will be the last such storm that you will see or if there will be more such storms down the track. #Amen Does the silt retain water that soaks through it? Could this event lead to local groundwater recharge? If so, that could be a future benefit from all this rain right where you are at. It could hold you over somewhat through the long drought to come sooner or later. Has any thought been given ( should any thought be given) to deepening the pond so it can store more water between the occasional super-rains? yes. the deep silt(sandy loam, its called) directly recharges the hickory sand aquifer beneath me. this is why i modified the levies and such in both pastures to divert floods into them, where it can soak in(also feed the deep subsoil, that sits just above a layer of black/gray clay, around 6 foot down.(i dug cores by hand long ago…yes i am a glutton for punishment, as well as a nut for such info) the native prairie grasses(and things like wilman love i planted long ago to stabilise the then sand) have deep, deep roots that…along with the tree roots…poke through that clay strata and allow water to percolate down. down around Kerrville, Fredricksburg, Comfort, etc(all along the Balcones Fault), they have caliche…a limestone and clay sort of dirt…that becomes concrete when theres a drought….that was the situation on july 3rd. that sort of formation is called Karst…and recharge occurs through caves and fractures created over long term by the rain being just acidic enough to eat through the limestone bedrock. so totally different than here. my area is older,as far as the long ago Llano Uplift is concerned….the Karst we have remaining is up on the hill tops, and has to a great extent worn away, leaving the old granite plutons…like Katemcy Rocks, or Enchanted Rock. Theres one of those under every limestone hill you find in the entire Llano Uplift. and the limestone on our hills is old and brittle…unsuited for building, etc. here, between the hills, are deep valleys, filled with silt/sandy loam…on my place, the granite bedrock is around 100-120′ deep. thats where our wells tap in. my neighbor, not 400 yards thataway, has granite not 20′ deep, and has to do rainwater. i ended up with just over 23″, as of this time yesterday. and a large part of that water that flowed on my place, stayed here(pastures are still covered in 4″ of water), and went down. this is why swales and contour plowing are such a big deal, allows the rain to hang around and soak in, leaving yer topsoil in place, rather than carrying it off to the Gulf. biggest impact for me is my house…due to my poor roofing skills,lol. ive been running fans and hauling out the remains of the mess the boys left me when they ran off into their lives, fixin to remove furniture(free and old), etc…and just GI the whole house, so i can spread pinesol on the whole floors, and finally paint them, sometime in august. mold is what im racing against. 1200 sq ft house, so a big job…and i already had too much work and not enough body. thank y’all for askin after me. So glad you’re OK Amfortas… and also glad you’re so handy and will be able to recover. Take good care. Glad you’re OK. Stay safe!

It’s likely to be the latter more often. But the opposite is true, as well: We also believe that the best place to hire from is the competition. Just recently, Meta’s new division — with an eye on developing artificial general intelligence (AGI) — announced 11 key hires from arch rivals like OpenAI, Anthropic and Google. If reports are to be believed, Mark Zuckerberg has been personally leading the hiring campaign by hosting some of the potential hires at his home. This prompted OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to claim that Meta offered $100 million signing bonuses to some of his employees. And Meta isn’t alone. The move echoes industry-wide trends. This year alone, Microsoft spent $650 million acquiring much of Inflection AI’s team while Amazon hired the co-founders of Adept, a start-up developing AI-powered agents. Begs the question whether anti-compete contracts aren’t at play? In a recent case of a software engineer vs his former employer, the Delhi High Court ruled that the non-compete clauses blocking job switches are not enforceable. The court said that Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, clearly says that any agreement that restrains anyone from exercising a lawful profession, trade or business shall be void. A research handbook published by the leading global law firm DLA Piper offers insights into anti-compete laws worldwide. Interestingly, among the 34 major countries they studied, only in five, including India, are the non-compete employment contracts non-enforceable. But, just in case you have forgotten the fine print of your employment contract and want to browse it again, you will find an anti-compete clause glaring at you. Did the MNCs bring their global template to India and were we only too happy to copy and paste it from entry-level jobs to senior leaders, making no distinction between the dictates of the roles and the laws of the land? Cognizant’s hiring of Wipro’s former CFO sparked a legal battle, which eventually got settled after nine months. The current legal proceedings between Cognizant and Infosys, involving allegations of anti-competitive practices in the US healthcare IT market, show that the stakes are high for these enterprises. When firms lose leaders who hold key customer relationships or techies who have the IP to build new-age products or platforms at the competition, the threat is real. This may prompt organisations to protect their interests, which explains the suits. In spite of these potential legal exposures, why do boards still hire CEOs from the competition? The mindset of large enterprises with deep pockets is to ‘buy’ talent, rather than ‘build’ it, since this takes time, and the risks of a potential anti-compete suit are outweighed by the benefits of the hiring. The popular ask from hiring managers is “We want to recruit someone who hits the road running”. When Zomato wanted to boost its live events business, it didn’t promote someone internally— it hired the live events head from BookMyShow and designated him as Founder. Ditto Starbucks — within 17 months of hiring a new CEO, Laxman Narasimhan, it replaced him with a leader from Chipotle, and immediately its stock price went up by 20 per cent and has remained steady since. Even the stock market cheers when you hire from the competition. The hypocritical mindset of enterprise culture is hard to miss. We hire our top talent from rivals but internally we berate them on a regular basis to build the competitive spirit in our teams. Whenever we chest-thump about our products, services or employers, we can’t help but reference them against our competitors, and hence it’s emotionally hard to accept anyone amongst us joining a rival. Hence, we resort to practices like ‘garden leave’, immediate relieving, legal threats, and/or holding on to financial dues as a mark of retaliation. All these also send a ‘message’ to colleagues of the consequences of joining the competition. These over-the-top reactions breed a different set of behaviours among team members, who eventually start lying about their health and personal matters when they leave or join friendly employers briefly and eventually join competitors a couple of months later. I agree it’s an uphill task to eliminate the anti-compete clauses we have included in all roles within our enterprises. But can we take a leaf out of Belgium, where non-competition clauses are valid only if the employee earns an annual gross remuneration of at least €78,706? Day in and day out, our leaders talk about the strength of our brands, the legacy of the company, loyal customers, enviable culture, best financial rewards and, not to forget, the Best Employer certificates that we keep flashing. However, our employment contracts don’t reflect the same spirit that we find on our office posters. Are enterprises built with such weak foundations that one leadership movement to the competition can bring them down? What’s the fear? When sports clubs and premier leagues allow players to be bought and compete against the club where they were trained at, why not enterprises?

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, July 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) and reminds investors of the July 21, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. The complaint alleges that the truth was revealed on February 27, 2025, when DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending and the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. Defendants also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify's stock price dropped $7.83 per share, or 36%, from a closing price of $21.73 on February 27, 2025, to a closing price of $13.90 on February 28, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding DoubleVerify’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/DV or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Time Published: 2025-07-06T08:47:17Z

Global developments will shape market sentiment in the coming week along with quarterly earnings. Among important events is the announcement of US-India trade deal. Along with US President Donald Trump’s move to inform trading partners about planned tariff rate. The US Federal Reserve will release the minutes of its June policy meeting, and investors will track interest rate decisions from central banks in Australia and South Korea. The June 2025 quarter earnings season begins this week, with Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. set to announce its results. On the IPO front, Travel Food Services’ public issue opens for subscription, and Crizac is set to debut on the stock exchanges. Back home, Indian equities ended last week in the red amid caution around the India-US trade deal, foreign capital outflows, and the start of the earnings season. The Nifty formed a small bearish candle on the weekly chart, suggesting a phase of consolidation after recent gains. Analysts expect the index to trade with a positive bias within the 25,200–25,700 range, with stock-specific action likely to drive market direction. Benchmark indices broke a two-day losing streak to settle higher on Friday but on a weekly basis the Nifty 50 and Sensex declined over 0.75%. The NSE Nifty 50 ended 55.70 points or 0.22% higher at 25,461, while the BSE Sensex closed 193.42 points or 0.23% up at 83,432.89. This week, the broader market indices outperformed the benchmark indices, with the Nifty and Sensex experiencing declines after two consecutive weeks of gains. The Nifty Realty sector saw a significant drop of over 2%, making it the worst-performing sector of the week, with Macrotech Developers Ltd. and Brigade Developers leading the declines. Investor focus in the coming week will remain firmly on the uncertain India-US trade deal, with US President Donald Trump's July 9 deadline approaching. Despite months of negotiations, no breakthrough has been achieved, and it is expected that the deal will be announced in the coming week. Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal made it clear that India will not rush into any deal based on external deadlines, insisting that any agreement must be fully concluded and in the national interest. Markets are also preparing for the start of the fr=irst quarter earnings season. IT majors Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and Tata Elxsi Ltd. will report their results during the week, offering early insights into sector performance amid ongoing global demand concerns. Retail giant DMart is scheduled to announce its results on Friday. Apart from corporate earnings, India’s weekly foreign exchange reserves, will be released on Friday. While investors wait for US President Donald Trump’s move ahead of the deadline of July 9, they will also track US Federal Reserve's minutes of its June policy meeting, and investors will track interest rate decisions from central banks in Australia and South Korea. US crude oil inventories will also be released on Wednesday. Additionally, the US will release the jobless claims data for the week ending July 5. UK will release its GDP date for the May. The primary market is set for a busy week with six new public issues lined up, including one major mainboard IPO and five SME offerings. The headline act is Travel Food Services, a Mumbai-based operator of airport lounges and quick-service restaurants across India and Malaysia. Its Rs 2,000 crore public issue opens on July 7, with a price band of Rs 1,045–1,100 per share. The offer comprises 1.82 crore existing shares, and investors must apply for a minimum of 13 shares. On the SME front, upcoming IPOs include GLEN Industries, Chemkart India, Smarten Power Systems, CFF Fluid Control, and Asston Pharmaceuticals. These smaller offerings aim to tap into investor appetite for niche, high-growth companies in specialised sectors. The listings provide a range of options for investors seeking opportunities outside of large-cap names. Several IPOs are also set to make their stock market debut this week. Pushpa Jewellers, Silky Overseas, Vandan Foods, Cedaar Textile, and Marc Loire will list on July 7. Crizac in the only main board listing in the week and will debut on July 9, followed by Cryogenic OGS and White Force on July 10, and Meta Infotech on July 11. The upcoming week is set to be active with various corporate actions, including several companies going ex-trade for dividends, bonus issues and rights issues. Investors looking to benefit from these actions should pay close attention to the ex-dates to ensure their eligibility. Key names in focus this week include HDFC Bank, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd., among others, all of which have record dates for final and special dividends coming up. Titan Co., JSW Steel Ltd., Mphasis Ltd., Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd., Apollo Tyres Ltd. and IDFC First Bank Ltd. are among the many stocks that will trade ex-dividend this week. Meghna Infracon Infrastructure Ltd., Alkosign Ltd., Dynamic Cables Ltd. and Roto Pumps Ltd. are scheduled to distribute bonus shares to their stakeholders, ahead of their respective record dates next week.

Title: The Force-Feeding of AI on an Unwilling Public

Time Published: 2025-07-06T06:19:41Z

A few months ago, I needed to send an email. But when I opened Microsoft Outlook, something had changed. Microsoft asked me to use Copilot to write my email. Copilot is my AI companion. (That’s the cute word they use.) Hey I don’t want a companion—especially not a fake AI buddy. I never asked for this. And what about the people receiving my emails? They don’t want this either. They want to hear from me, not a bot. How do I turn my companion off? After some trial-and-error, I found a way to disable Copilot. Phew! But a few days later, Microsoft surprised me again. It wouldn’t let me save an Excel file until I had agreed to new terms for my software account. Guess what? AI is now bundled into all of my Microsoft software. Even worse, Microsoft recently raised the price of its subscriptions by $3 per month to cover the additional AI benefits. I get to use my AI companion 60 times per month as part of the deal. But I don’t want to use it. I want to kill it. As you can see, I’ve never used this service. I still have all 60 credits unused. But I’m paying for it—because it’s now embedded into Microsoft Word, Excel, etc. This is how AI gets introduced to the marketplace—by force-feeding the public. And they’re doing this for a very good reason. Most people won’t pay for AI voluntarily—just 8% according to a recent survey. So they need to bundle it with some other essential product. You never get to decide. Before proceeding let me ask a simple question: Has there ever been a major innovation that helped society, but only 8% of the public would pay for it? That’s never happened before in human history. Everybody wanted electricity in their homes. Everybody wanted a radio. Everybody wanted a phone. Everybody wanted a refrigerator. Everybody wanted a TV set. Everybody wanted the Internet. They wanted it. They paid for it. They enjoyed it. AI isn’t like that. People distrust it or even hate it—and more so with each passing month. So the purveyors must bundle it into current offerings, and force usage that way. There’s another reason why huge tech companies do this—but they don’t like to talk about it. If they bundle AI into other products and services, they can hide the losses on their income statement. That wouldn’t be possible if they charged for AI as a standalone product. That would make its profitability (or, more likely, loss) very easy to measure. Shareholders would complain. Stock prices would drop. Companies would be forced to address customer concerns. But if AI is bundled into existing businesses, Silicon Valley CEOs can pretend that AI is a moneymaker, even if the public is lukewarm or hostile. It’s like a restaurant selling granite rocks for dessert. Nobody will buy them or eat them—so the product fails miserably. But if a popular restaurant adds a dollar to the meal price, and gives every customer a rock with their bill—well, then they can say that: Every customer gets rocks for dessert. Every customer pays for it. Their business is more profitable because of the tasty granite rocks. This is how AI accounting works in Silicon Valley. And that’s why Google does something similar to Microsoft. They add AI to search results—you don’t get to choose. It’s force-feeding all over again. So these huge digital platforms can pretend that users have totally embraced the new tech. Shut up, buddy, and chew on your rock. This is how AI gets implemented everywhere. You don’t get to choose. You’re never asked. It just shows up. Now you have to deal with it. I don’t want AI customer service—but I don’t get a choice. I don’t want AI responses to my Google searches—but I don’t get a choice. I don’t want AI integrated into my software—but I don’t get a choice. I don’t want AI sending me emails—but I don’t get a choice. I don’t want AI music on Spotify—but I don’t get a choice. I don’t want AI books on Amazon—but I don’t get a choice. If they gave people a choice, they would reject this tyranny masquerading as innovation. The AI business model would collapse overnight if they needed consumer opt-in. Just pass that law, and see how quickly the bots disappear. Customer surveys prove that. The survey cited above presented customers with descriptions of different refrigerators. When AI was added as a feature, people showed a preference for all the other models. The Wall Street Journal concludes that companies should “beware of promoting AI in products.” And it’s more than just products and services. People don’t even want AI in texts or documents of any sort. In an earlier day, customer feedback would discourage businesses from adding AI. But the dominant AI companies are huge quasi-monopolies. So they don’t ask, they don’t care—they just do it. Every day it gets more brazen. Meta is now planning to unleash bots on you in even more aggressive ways than Google or Microsoft. They are training AI bots to send you messages, whether you want them or not. And I know (from painful personal experience) that you cannot disable Facebook Messenger without shutting down your entire Facebook account. There’s a word for this. It’s called spam—and people hate it. But that’s the blight of the AI revolution. It looks like spam. It smells like spam. It tastes like spam. What happens if we decide to boycott AI? The sad truth is that we can’t. It’s already too powerful. If I wanted to boycott AI, I would need to give up My email account All Google searches My word processing software Also Excel, PowerPoint, etc. Amazon and many other online retailers Spotify and any other music streamer that allows it Contacting customer service at many companies Etc. etc. etc. That’s bad news—because most of us need some of those things to live and work. But it will soon get much worse. Just wait and see. The day will eventually come when… You want to see a doctor or nurse—but you will be forced to use the AI chatbot. You will desperately need counseling, but only AI will be available. You seek legal advice, and just get a bot. You apply for a job, but they give it to a bot instead. You need an emergency responder—police, firefighter, paramedic—but you can only reach a bot. We already know that they won’t let us choose. That’s already decided. So now the only question is how quickly they will remove the few remaining instances where humans deal with humans. Judging by the current situation, tech companies will move quickly. They don’t ask for permission. It just happens. What’s most shocking is that they have done all this before making AI reliable. Every day I hear accounts of stupid and ridiculous things coming from bots. You would think they would fix this mess before forcing AI on us. But here’s the harsh reality. They won’t fix it, because they don’t know how. Despite that, they will accelerate the force-feeding. There should be laws against this. There should be transparency laws. There should be opt-in laws. There should be liability laws. There should be IP laws. We’re lucky that AI bots don’t write the laws—at least not yet. We should take action before that happens. And if politicians won’t act, let’s turn to voter initiatives (which are binding in many places) or class-action suits or take other steps. I have a hunch that juries will be sympathetic to our plight. After all, they are getting force-fed too. Let me address a final question—which is the frequently mentioned argument that the US needs to develop AI as fast as possible to get there before the Chinese. I’m not sure where there is. But I’m happy to let China or other countries arrive at that unhappy destination while I wait behind and watch. I’m absolutely certain that getting there will be a matter of great regret. There might even be the last place you would want to be. So I’d rather it happened as far away from here as possible. Ted, you called it "spam." My term for it is far less polite. I'm off all social media. I refuse to use AI for my writing. When AI "overviews" come up on Google searches, I immediately skip past them to real sources. I opt out as much as one individual can. There are free alternatives to Microsoft Office and they don't have AI. No posts Ready for more?
