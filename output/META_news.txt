A wave of volatility swept through the cryptocurrency markets on Wednesday, as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s hawkish remarks on inflation and tariffs sent leveraged traders scrambling. The sudden market tremor resulted in over $200 million in liquidations in a single hour, with Bitcoin briefly dipping below the $116,000 mark. The US central bank, as expected, left its benchmark interest rates unchanged in its latest policy decision. However, it was Chair Powell’s subsequent comments that captured the market’s full attention. He insisted on the potential for inflationary pressures to re-emerge, particularly from the impact of trade tariffs. This cautious stance was maintained even as two Federal Reserve officials dissented from the decision, signaling their preference for an immediate rate cut. The crypto market’s reaction to Powell’s hawkish tone was swift and sharp. In the hour that he spoke, liquidations of leveraged positions spiked to over $200 million across all digital assets, according to data from CoinGlass. Bitcoin (BTC) felt the immediate pressure, dipping below $116,000. However, the sell-off proved to be short-lived. Later in the session, Bitcoin managed to bounce back above $117,000, though it was still down 0.8% for the day and continued to trade at the lower end of its tight, three-week range. Ether (ETH) experienced a similar whipsaw, initially sliding by as much as 3% before recovering to trade at $3,750, ending the period with a modest loss of 0.6% over the past 24 hours. Altcoins initially posted even steeper declines, with Solana’s SOL, Avalanche’s AVAX, and Hyperliquid’s HYPE tokens all dropping by 4%-5% before paring their losses. Meme coins like BONK and PENGU plunged by as much as 10% each before also bouncing back. This volatility in the crypto space contrasted with positive developments in the traditional stock market, where tech giants Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) posted strong quarterly earnings, lifting their stocks by 10% and 6%, respectively, in after-hours trading. Despite Powell’s cautious rhetoric, some market analysts believe the Federal Reserve may be misjudging the economic landscape. “The market is increasingly starting to think the Fed may be behind the curve,” commented Matt Mena, an analyst at digital asset issuer 21Shares, in a market note. “Last week’s PCE [Personal Consumption Expenditures] print marked the second soft reading in a row, and consumer spending is weakening,” Mena wrote. With unemployment edging higher and real yields still restrictive, maintaining such tight policy risks overtightening into a broader slowdown. Mena suggested that the current market setup is reminiscent of the last quarter of 2023, a period characterized by “softening inflation, rising political volatility, and a Fed constrained by lagging indicators.” He argued that “the stage is set” for the Federal Reserve to eventually pivot to lower interest rates, a move that he believes could be a powerful catalyst for Bitcoin, potentially driving its price to $150,000 by the end of the year. For now, however, the market remains caught between the Fed’s current hawkish stance and the growing expectation of an eventual, and perhaps necessary, policy shift.

Title: Meta Crushed Q2 Ad Revenue (Oh, And It’s Investing In AI That’s Way Smarter Than You)

Twenty years ago, Facebook came out with a new feature that let you poke your friends. (Remember pokes?) Now, Meta is investing hundreds of billions of dollars in AI to purportedly develop “personal superintelligence,” in CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s words, that teaches itself and outpaces human cognition. Quite the evolution. “AI that surpasses human intelligence in every way we think is now in sight,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors during the company’s Q2 earnings call on Wednesday. “Meta’s vision is to bring personal superintelligence to everyone so that people can direct it towards what they value in their own lives.” Zuckerberg waxed poetic about a not-so-far-off future in which superintelligence “empowers people to be more creative, develop culture and communities, connect with each other and lead more fulfilling lives.” Cool, cool. But, meanwhile, Meta remains primarily an advertising company. Total revenue in the second quarter was $47.5 billion, up 22% year over year, with advertising accounting for nearly all of that at $46.6 billion, up 21% YOY. Meta’s stock soared by more than 11% in after-hours trading. Ad-romeda Meta is making a massive investment in AI because “we have a conviction that superintelligence is going to improve every aspect of what we do,” Zuckerberg said. And that includes improving ad performance, of course. Get our editors’ roundup delivered to your inbox every weekday. Zuckerberg attributed Meta’s particularly strong performance in Q2 to its ads business “unlocking greater efficiency and gains” by applying AI across its system. For example, in Q2, Meta introduced new personalization enhancements to Andromeda, its AI-powered recommendation model for ads. Andromeda underpins the ad retrieval stage of Meta’s ad system by selecting several thousand relevant ads to serve at any given moment from a pool of tens of millions of potential candidates. These improvements drove roughly 5% more ad conversions on Instagram and 3% more on Facebook, according to Zuckerberg. Andromeda is also being rolled out to new surfaces, including Facebook Reels. Pricing and performance Meta’s “engagement tailwinds,” in the words of CFO Susan Li, led to an 11% uptick in the total number of ad impressions across all of Meta’s properties, although ad load optimizations on Facebook were also a factor. And demand was there to meet the scaled-up supply. The average price per ad increased by 9% in the second quarter driven by improved ad performance. Although pricing growth overall slowed modestly quarter over quarter because of accelerated impression growth in Q2 across the family of apps. These results are directly related to Meta’s focus on improving monetization efficiency, Li said. “We continue to optimize ad supply across each surface to better deliver ads at the time and place they are most relevant to people,” she said. A-eye But even as Meta refines the mechanics of its advertising system, its vision is fixed on advanced AI intelligence and, well, eyeglasses. Although overall VR headset sales declined, sales of AI-powered Ray-Ban Meta glasses have tripled year over year. In response to an investor question about whether smart glasses will eventually replace smartphones, Zuckerberg answered with a “yes, and.” He views glasses as the ideal form factor for AI because people can engage both visually and auditorily while staying hands-free and, unlike in virtual reality, connected to their physical surroundings. “I wear contact lenses, and if I didn’t have my vision corrected, I’d be at a cognitive disadvantage going through the world,” Zuckerberg said. “I think in the future, if you don’t have glasses that have AI or some way to interact with AI, [you’ll] probably be at a pretty significant cognitive disadvantage compared to other people who you’re working with or competing against.”

Title: Meta Seizes Its Moment to Spend More Aggressively in the AI Race

(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. is taking advantage of its lucrative advertising business and stepping up spending next year, with executives saying now is the time to seize on investment opportunities in artificial intelligence. Investors cheered the plan, sending shares up more than 10% in after-hours trading. The social media giant reported second-quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat Wall Street estimates and forecast better-than-expected results for the current quarter. “We really believe that this is a time for us to really make investments in the future of AI, as I think it will open up both new opportunities for us in addition to strengthen our core business,” Chief Financial Officer Susan Li told investors during a call. Meta executives underscored that its evolving AI technology, which has been integrated into its ads products, is already producing “meaningful” revenue. Meta and its big tech peers, including Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp., are relying on their legacy businesses to fund their pursuits of pricey AI talent and data centers, adding billions to their spending plans with full support from Wall Street. Meta lifted the low end of its forecast for 2025 capital expenditures, while also providing early steer on 2026 spending. Meta said costs will continue to grow at an even faster pace next year — particularly as it focuses on AI infrastructure needs and the niche technical talent that can fine-tune its models. The strategy only works for Meta if the company keeps printing money from advertising. So far, it is. Meta’s current-quarter sales are expected to be $47.5 billion to $50.5 billion, Meta said. The midpoint of that range exceeded the average analyst estimate of $46.2 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That ads business, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said, is already seeing a “meaningful” amount of revenue from new generative AI features. “On advertising, the strong performance this quarter is largely thanks to AI unlocking greater efficiency and gains across our ad system,” he said. Meta “crushed it” in the quarter, in part because AI improvements allowed the company to increase the average price of its ads, Matt Britzman, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said in an email. “All this spending adds some near-term risks to the bottom line, but Meta looks set to be a clear winner in the AI space over the longer term.” Meta stock was up 19% so far this year before Wednesday’s report. Zuckerberg is spending to build new data centers and lure top AI researchers with compensation packages valued at hundreds of millions of dollars, Bloomberg has reported. The company recently restructured its internal AI division, now referred to as Meta Superintelligence Labs, in an effort to build human-level AI capabilities and apply that technology across its products. The group is led by Alexandr Wang, the former CEO of data labeling company Scale AI, who joined Meta in June after Zuckerberg paid $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in the company. Wall Street has previously been more skeptical of Zuckerberg’s big bets on new technology. He renamed the company Meta after the “metaverse,” the idea that people would work and socialize in a virtual world with the help of headsets. That vision has been slow to take hold. At the same time, Meta’s hardware division has come under scrutiny for bleeding cash for years. In the second quarter, Reality Labs generated $370 million in revenue — less than the $386 million analysts expected — with $4.5 billion in operating losses. While the company sold more smart glasses, it saw a decline in sales for its Quest headsets. AI is different, because Meta’s competitors are making similar decisions. Last week, Alphabet raised its full-year capital expenditure forecast to $85 billion due to higher AI spending. At Microsoft, Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said the company would spend upwards of $30 billion in the current quarter, which would be at least 50% more than the outlay during the same period a year earlier. “In some ways, this race is historically akin to the races for the PC, web browser, search engine and smartphone,” Mike Proulx, an analyst at Forrester, wrote in a note. “But the big difference is that this race is pacing so much faster because AI — the very thing that Meta and others are racing towards — helps to accelerate itself.” Proulx added that to win the AI race, companies will need to reach into their “deep pockets.” More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

The parent company of Facebook and Instagram says 3.48 billion people now use at least one of its apps on a daily basis Meta nearly had its best sales quarter ever during the second quarter, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram reported on Wednesday, as its revenue increased 22% year-over-year to $47.52 billion. The tech giant reported growth across multiple sectors in the period: 3.48 billion people now use at least one of Meta’s apps on a daily basis, up 6% from a year ago, while Meta now has nearly 76,000 people working for it — up 7% year-over-year. Meta also reported its net income surged 36% to more than $18 billion during the second quarter. Wall Street seemed to love Meta’s report, with the company’s stock price surging 9.61% in after-hours trading to $762 per share. If those gains hold on Thursday morning, when markets open, it would represent a new all-time high for Meta. (Its current all-time high is $747.90, which it hit in June.) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, on the company’s earnings call on Wednesday afternoon, said Meta had a strong quarter that will help it continue to “invest heavily” in artificial intelligence. Zuckerberg has made it clear several times this year that AI is his key focus, and on Wednesday he said Meta is making “good progress” on the latest versions of its Llama AI model. Here are the key results from Meta’s second quarter report: Revenue: Meta reported $47.52 billion in second quarter sales, up 22% annually; that easily surpassed the $44.80 billion analysts had projected. It also came in narrowly behind the fourth quarter of 2024, when Meta reported $48.39 billion in revenue, for the company’s best sales quarter ever. As is usually the case with Meta, most of its sales — 97.9% to be exact — stemmed from advertisements. Net income: Meta reported $18.34 billion in net income, which was 36% higher than a year ago. That was also the second-best profit in Meta history, following the $20.84 billion it reported during the fourth quarter of 2024. Daily active users: Daily users of one of Meta’s apps — which includes Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads– increased 6% to 3.48 billion. Meta did not share an update on how each platform is performing individually, after reporting Threads had hit 350 million users during its first-quarter report. Earnings Per Share: $7.14, which topped the $5.92 EPS analysts projected. Reality Labs — Meta’s division focused on artificial intelligence, virtual reality and augmented reality technology — continues to be the one sector of the business that is losing money. Meta reported a loss of $4.53 billion for Reality Labs during the second quarter, after it had lost $4.21 billion between Jan. and March. Zuckerberg’s comments on continuing to invest in artificial intelligence come after he said in January this would be a”defining year for AI.” That same month, Zuckerberg said Meta would spend between $60 billion and $65 billion to “significantly” expand its AI team; the company then updated that projection during its first quarter earnings call in April, saying it planned on spending up to $72 billion this year on AI — a figure Meta reiterated in its second-quarter report on Wednesday. Zuckerberg has put Meta’s money where his mouth is, with the company investing $14.3 billion in Scale AI, a company that offers a platform and training data for developing AI models, in June. As part of the deal, 28-year-old Alexandr Wang, Scale’s chief executive and co-founder, joined Meta to spearhead its new AI research division, dubbed the “Superintelligence” lab. Meta also recently poached four top OpenAI researchers for its AI team, as the company has been extending multiyear offers that reach up to $300 million. On Wednesday, Zuckerberg said he wants to keep his AI team “small” and “talent dense,” which he said he is the “optimal configuration” for driving research. Meta CFO Susan Li, in her comments accompanying Meta’s earnings release, said the company has spent about $30 billion so far this year; for comparison, Meta spent $39.23 billion in 2024. Li said Meta plans on continuing to spend big, both this year and in 2026, to fund its AI ambitions. She noted that operating expenses for the year will be between $113 billion and $118 billion, a slightly higher range than before. “While the infrastructure planning process remains highly dynamic, we currently expect another year of similarly significant capital expenditures dollar growth in 2026 as we continue aggressively pursuing opportunities to bring additional capacity online to meet the needs of our artificial intelligence efforts and business operations,” Li said. Heading into Wednesday, Wall Street has been on board with Meta’s AI push, with the company’s stock price up 16% since the start of the year — and up 50% since July 2024. Li, on the company’s earnings call, said Instagram is focused on “promoting original content” and being more creator-friendly. She said two-thirds of the posts recommended to American Instagram users are now original posts, and that the company is prioritizing the “freshness” of its recommendations. Looking ahead, Meta projected its third quarter revenue will be between $47.50 billion and $50.50 billion.

Title: Tim Cook will face some big questions during Apple's Earnings Report Call – here's why the answers matter to you

Tim Cook in the hot seat When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Apple quarterly earnings reports are not usually fodder for consumer interest. It's a lot of sales numbers and explanations about why the falling dollar, rising yen, or China headwinds are impacting sales and earnings results. Without the benefit of product introductions, it can be a snoozefest, but this time should be different, and mostly because of Apple's not-so-great year. Put simply, Apple has a lot of explaining to do. So while Apple CFO Kevan Parekh and CEO Tim Cook will spend the first half of the earnings call that is set for Thursday, July 31 at 5PM ET (2PM PT / 10PM BST), droning through profits, operating expenses, capital, and even stock splits, it's the open call with analysts that should be most illuminating, important, and, possibly, even entertaining part of the event. Analysts should be quizzing Cook and company on these juicy topics: As I noted above, Apple has fallen far behind in the all-important AI race, and promises that the updated Siri will show up "in the coming year" are less than comforting, especially since that might be next year. Analysts will rightly demand specifics. And while I do not expect Cook to get pinned down, he might offer some assurance that a Siri that can compete with, say, Gemini or ChatGPT, will arrive by the end of this year, as opposed to slipping into 2026. I would love to see analysts press Cook on Apple's overall AI strategy, one that I believe is flawed for being too cautious. The competition is flying down AI Highway with abandon, and with Superintelligence or General Artificial Intelligence on the horizon, Apple cannot afford to take the slow approach. Any more delays and Apple will lose more than just this AI race. During every earnings call, analysts make desperate attempts to get Cook to mention upcoming products. He never does, but Cook will talk vaguely about "the best lineup ever" of upcoming technologies. His enthusiasm can often speak volumes about what to expect and if any of it will move the needle. Even though Vision Pro fails to dazzle on the sales side, it remains the most powerful and perhaps the best consumer technology Apple has ever produced. I expect Cook to highlight consumer and enterprise interest, as well as recent content successes, such as the Bono Documentary. It's the analysts' job, though, to press Cook here and see if they can get him to admit that Vision Pro will never be a consumer product, at least not at its current price. A good segue here would be a return for Cook to mentions of an AR future. Apple's wearable game cannot remain confined to watches and earbuds, not when Meta is making hay with all those Meta Smart Glasses from Ray-Ban and Oakley. If we only consider AR glasses, Apple still has some time since Google, Samsung, and Meta are all still trying to figure out how to make high-quality lenses that do not need the bulk of larger frames to support them. Could analysts goad Cook into mentioning future "iGlasses"? Most people expect Apple to deliver its thinnest iPhone ever this September in the form of an iPhone 17 Air. Cook will not name this product, but he could mention "new form factors," which could be referring to the thinner Air and, maybe, a folding iPhone. In both areas, though, Apple is behind Samsung, which now has the best and thinnest foldable design in the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 and an admirably thin, if uninspiring, Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge. Analysts will want at least a hint that Apple has an answer for all this. Cook will not want to talk about US-based manufacturing, tariffs, or the guy who calls him a friend, President Trump. But analysts will ask and press for projections on how tariffs might impact iPhone and other Apple gadget pricing. Here, I expect Cook to offer at least some color, if not concrete projections. He'll talk again about how Apple is prepared for supply chain fluctuations, which include component pricing pressure. He will assure everyone that Apple has a plan for this uncertain future. Cook might remind people about how Apple has already diversified manufacturing so that it's not all in China and point to the $500 billion investment in the US, which most recently has included manufacturing training programs for upcoming businesspeople and their businesses. I don't know if that will satisfy everyone, especially not Trump, who has consistently demanded that Apple build the iPhone in the US. At least Cook will get to tout the sea changes coming to all of Apple's major platforms and the impact of Liquid Glass on, for instance, the iPhone. iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26 are big updates and ones that, whether or not people love them, do promise to change how they use these platforms.

Title: The Hype is the Product

Michał "rysiek" Woźniak 27.07.2025 .md Large publicly traded tech companies seem to no longer consider their customers – that is, people and organizations who actually buy their products or pay for access to their services – their core focus. The focus has instead turned towards the stock price. Their real clients, the entities they really care about, are the stockholders. Reasons are many, perhaps one of them being that people making decisions tend to own stock options or have bonuses tied to stock performance of the companies they run. This means that for a large, established tech company the product or service it offers does not matter all that much anymore. It needs to be just barely good enough to keep people using it. The easiest way to do this is some form of a monopoly. Monopoly is the business model of Silicon Valley, and they are not even shy about that. If you ever tried moving an organization wholesale from Google Workspace to Microsoft 365 (or whatever it is called this week), you know what I mean. These are two sets of office productivity services; on a basic level their functionality is very similar. Mail, calendar, contacts, document editing, access controls, and so on. And yet you can’t even directly share a file from Google Workspace to a person who uses Microsoft 365 (or vice-versa) in a way that would allow them to access it within their own service, using their existing account, without manually exporting and importing the file. This lack of basic interoperability is not a technical necessity but a business decision. For example, Open Cloud Mesh protocol allows for a lot of interoperability between providers of such office productivity services, and is implemented by Nextcloud. What this means in practice is that two people with accounts on different independently-run instances of any software implementing this protocol, hosted at two different providers, could not only share, but collaborate on a file – each from their own account, using a familiar interface. Someone confidently using one of the two largest online office suites can quite reasonably feel completely lost when presented with the interface of the other. Interoperability and data portability between them seems like science fiction, to a point where it is genuinely difficult for some people to even understand the concept. What this means in practice is that it does not matter if people using their services hate them – it only matters that they don’t hate them strongly enough to want to go through hell of migrating over to some other (or the other) provider. With a barrier to migration between providers this high, people using the service can be exploited in all sorts of ways they could not have been otherwise. Cory Doctorow aptly calls that enshittification. At the same time, though, this also makes it really difficult for service providers to compete on quality of the service or its features. It’s not enough to have a product that is just a bit better than the competition. It has to be so much better that it makes it worthwhile for people to go through the hell of migrating over. That’s a tough sell – that’s kind of the point of creating these barriers in the first place. And yet the line must go up. Somehow, tech companies need to convince investors that their services are really becoming so much better – so that they keep paying more and more for company stock. Enter the hype. Hype, of course, is nothing new. Gartner even made a graph about it, a long time ago. Using hype to sell products barely anyone actually needs for prices that make no sense has a long and storied history – so much so that “tulip mania” has basically become a cliché. Using hype to scam people out of their money outright (instead of selling them something tangible, albeit at an unreasonably inflated price) is also not particularly innovative. Just ask Elizabeth Holmes. What’s new here, I think, is large, established companies using hype not to push products or services, but to push their stock. And doing so in unison, pumping the same bubble together. Big Tech paid close attention to the cryptocurrency and NFT bubble. They tried to get in on it, but they mostly failed. Probably the most useful thing that emerged from the whole NFT frenzy was that Twitter’s erstwhile hexagonal profile pictures for NFT holders made it trivial to block cryptobros for a time. Then, Facebook tried to manufacture their own hype bubble with Metaverse, somewhat piggy-backing on NFTs – and even changing the company name (partially to distract from their culpability in Rohingya genocide). Metaverse was inevitable. Anyone not on the Metaverse would unavoidably be left behind. Mark Zuckerberg bet the shop on that particular hype. The shop lost 46.5 billion-with-a-b USD on it. Zuckerberg took “full responsibility” by firing eleven thousand people. Today Meta is pivoting to – you guessed it – AI. “AI” is not the only hype game in town (Amazon for years tried to hype drone delivery as the obvious future, for example), but it seems almost tailor-made for huge tech monopolists. It requires insane resources and access to unfathomable depths of training data, creating a barrier for any potential newcomers. It is just futuristic enough to sound like magic and get people somewhat excited even though many of us are so, so bored with tech – but at the same time not too out there, so that “Serious People” (i.e. large stockholders and rich investors) can pretend to have intelligent conversations about it. And it is pretty easy to integrate it with existing services (in the end, it’s all just text). Since Mark got hooked on spicy autocomplete, Facebook has become even more of a hell-hole than before. Meta is also pushing LLM-based chatbots down users’ throats in WhatsApp, Instagram, and soon almost certainly Threads. Did anyone who actually uses these platforms ask for that? No. Is it already causing harm? Yes. Does that matter? Not in the slightest. Google is pushing their LLM-based tools into everything from search to Google Workspaces – and making users pay for that. You don’t want these tools anywhere near your files? Tough luck; you might try to disable them, you might even succeed, but you will still be paying for them. Same with Microsoft. A lot of people paying for access to these services are definitely not happy. But they’re stuck, and they aren’t going anywhere. So that’s not really important, not something that is considered a serious problem. Enshittification and hype-as-the-product are two sides of the same coin; they are both enabled by barriers to user migration. With such barriers solidly in place, what is important is that in the next earnings call stockholders will hear that usage of “AI” across all product categories went up by double-digits and revenue increased. They won’t know or care that it’s only because somebody flipped a switch and just gave everyone access, while hiking the price, whether they wanted it or not. There is more and more proof these tools are not as useful as they are hyped out to be. LLM-based coding tools seem to actually hurt programmers’ productivity. “Hallucinations” are not going away because the only thing these LLMs can do is “hallucinate”; they just sometimes (about 30% of the time, in fact) happen to generate some text that has some connection to reality. They also keep causing information security problems and turn out to be vulnerable in most hilarious of ways. LLM chatbots are also causing real people real harm. And on top of all that it seems like “AI” is actually a turn-off for prospective customers. So what? Investors just can’t get enough, and that’s what counts (even as they themselves get high on their own hype supply). In fact, increasingly, hype is the only thing that counts, as larger and larger chunk of investment money is chasing it – to the detriment of everything else that happens not to bolt the hyped tech onto its unrelated but otherwise solid product or service. The bubble grows. The line goes up. Because the hype is the product. And when “AI” loses it’s sheen, “quantum” is already waiting in the wings.

Title: Apple is in need of a win as it reports earnings this week

Apple scored a much-needed win. The company reported better-than-expected iPhone sales, which were up 13% year over year. Apple delivered record third-quarter revenue of $94 billion compared to Wall Street's estimates of $89.3 billion. It also beat on earnings per share, a key measure of profitability, which came in at $1.57 compared to estimates of $1.43. Apple stock jumped after the results, trading up 2.4% after hours. Apple's main moneymaker, the iPhone, brought in $44.58 billion — a huge beat compared to Wall Street's estimates of $40.06 billion. In China, a highly competitive market for Apple that has proved challenging, revenue grew 4% year over year, beating estimates. Apple's services revenue reached a new high of $27.42 billion. "Investors should not underestimate the fact that Apple delivered a massive revenue beat — and the biggest revenue growth in dollar terms since 2021 — in its slowest quarter of the year," wrote Thomas Monteiro, a senior analyst at Investing.com. The iPhone giant has faced tariff headwinds in recent months and continues to lag behind its Big Tech peers in the AI race, topics that both came up on the company's earnings call with analysts. CEO Tim Cook said Apple's financial hit from tariffs was $800 million — $100 million less than the company expected. Apple said those costs are likely to balloon to $1.1 billion in the September quarter. Apple also noticed an "unusual buying pattern" among US consumers in April as tariffs made headlines, with Americans buying up more iPhones and Macs. On the hot topic of capital expenditure amid the AI race, Apple's chief financial officer, Kevan Parekh, said investors should expect cap-ex to increase, though "not exponentially." Cook said Apple was "significantly growing" its AI investment and "very open to M&A that accelerates our road map." "We're making good progress on a more personalized Siri, and we do expect to release the features next year," Cook said. Follow along for highlights from Apple's analyst call, where Cook was asked about how the iPhone would fit into a world of AI gadgets, the risk of losing Google's $20 billion search deal, and more: Analysts wrote that they were happy with iPhone strategy and growth in China — but several said the clock is ticking on AI. In a post-earnings note, EMARKETER analysts wrote that results show Apple's resilience as it faces "looming challenges with AI development timelines, tariff pressures, and Google's antitrust issues." Still, continued success will rest on AI development, the analysts said. EMARKETER is owned by Business Insider's parent company, Axel Springer. "While the AI arms race may pressure Apple toward bolder moves, including potential acquisitions, its disciplined approach to product quality over speed should help it maintain a competitive advantage in the premium market over the long-haul provided it makes the necessary R&D investments in AI," they added. Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives touted Apple's 4% year-over-year revenue growth in China but was quick to point out what's missing. "This was a major step in the right direction for Cook and Cupertino with China the star of the show," the perennial tech bull wrote. "Now it's time to address the elephant in the room...the AI strategy which remains absent while the rest of the tech world is laser focused on the AI Revolution at warp speed." An analyst mentions that Apple hasn't historically done a lot of big acquisitions, and asks if the company feels it needs to accelerate its AI road map. Cook says he is open to the idea. "We've acquired around seven companies this year, and that's companies from all walks of life, not all AI-oriented," he says. "We're very open to M and A that accelerates our road map," Cook says. "We are not stuck on a certain size company, although the ones that we have acquired thus far this year are small in nature. But we basically ask ourselves whether a company can help us accelerate a road map. If they do, then we're interested." Apple has reportedly discussed the idea of acquiring AI startup Perplexity. Apple says it continues to believe in its wearable devices. Cook highlights Vision OS and its customizable widgets, as well as a revamp of the virtual Persona avatars, which are now more realistic after an update. "We continue to be very focused on it," Cook says of wearable devices. "I don't want to get into the roadmap on it, but this is an area that we really believe in." Apple is facing competitive pressure in the glasses category, as the Vision Pro is a bulky headset that costs around $3,500. Meta's AI glasses, made in partnership with Ray-Ban and Oakley, have been a hit for the company. As it was on Meta and Microsoft's earnings calls, cap-ex is a hot topic on today's earnings call. Apple's CFO says much of Apple's expected increase in capital expenditure can be attributed to AI investments. "A lot of that's a function of the investment we're making in AI as we mentioned," he says. "We also have other items that fall into that category, facilities, and some of our retail store investments, but I would say a lot of the growth is really being driven by AI," Apple's CFO says. "We did see some obvious signs of pull ahead, really, in the April time frame around the tariff-related discussions that were out in the marketplace," he says. Cook calls it an "unusual buying pattern" that "largely occurred in April" toward the beginning of the quarter — largely in the US, he adds. The revenue boost from tariff-related buying behavior accounted for about one point of Apple's 10-point growth at the company level, he says. Cook continues to talk through the nuances of Apple's supply chain and how the company is working to mitigate tariff impacts. Referencing Apple's work to ship more iPhones to American customers that are produced in India, avoiding China tariffs, Cook says: "There hasn't been a change to that, which is the the vast majority of the iPhone sold in the US, or the majority, I should say, have a country of origin, of India, and the vast majority of the products, other products, the Mac and the iPad and the watch have a country of origin of Vietnam that are sold in the United States."Cook again stresses that "we do a lot" in the US, touting Apple's $500 billion commitment. Apple's tariff-related impact prediction is up from that of the June quarter's due to volume, Cook says. Apple will ultimately "do more in the United States" to mitigate the risk of tariffs on products manufactured abroad, he adds. Asked what Apple would do if its revenue-sharing deal with Google were blocked by a judge, CEO Tim Cook declined to get into specifics, saying he wouldn't comment on potential court rulings or their consequences. The company's outlook next quarter assumes the current agreement with Google remains in place. Google has paid Apple roughly $20 billion a year — a huge chunk of Apple's services business revenue — to make its search engine the default on iPhones, but deals like this are in question amid Google's antitrust case. OpenAI recently spent $6.5 billion to acquire former Apple design chief Jony Ive's AI device startup, which will see Ive work on AI hardware for the company. "It's difficult to see a world where iPhone is not living in it," Cook said. "I think that the devices are likely to be complementary devices, not substitution." "We're making good progress on a more personalized Siri, and we do expect to release the features next year," Cook says. "As we had said earlier, our focus, from an AI point of view, is on putting AI features across the platform that are deeply personal, private, and seamlessly integrated." "We are significantly growing our investment," the CEO adds. "We did during the June quarter. We will again in the September quarter." "We are also reallocating a fair number of people to focus on AI features within the company that are, you know, we have a great, great team, and we're, we're putting all of our energy behind it," Cook adds. His answer was in response to an analyst's question about Google searches on Safari decreasing for the first time in 22 years in the age of AI — a reference to remarks Apple's Eddy Cue made recently. Apple expects its total revenue to grow mid-to-high single digits for the September quarter, with Services growing at a similar rate to the June quarter year over year. "We expect gross margin to be between 46% and 47% which includes the estimated impact of the $1.1 billion tariff-related costs that Tim referred to earlier," Apple says. Operating expenses are expected to be between $15.6 billion and $15.8 billion Earlier this month, Apple announced a $500 million investment into MP Materials, a US-based company that works with rare earth materials. In August, it plans to launch Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit to help train and support American manufacturers. Cook says that Apple recorded $800 million in tariff-related costs for the June quarter, about $100 million less than it warned investors of last quarter. "We're really proud of our results for the June quarter," Cook says. Looking ahead to the September quarter, Cook estimates a $1.1 billion tariff impact. Apple's Services business in its fiscal Q3 hit a record high of $27.4 billion, while AppleTV+ scored 81 nominations for the Emmy Awards. Cook shouts out its hit show "Severance," which led the charge with 27 nominations. Today, Cook says, the platform has 585 wins under its belt. "We're making good progress on a more personalized Siri, and as we've said before, we expect to release these features next year," Cook says. "We see AI as one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime," he adds. The first question is about Apple's capital expenditure plans — a closely watched number amid the AI race. Apple says AI is a "pretty significant driver" of its spending for this year. "We saw an acceleration of growth around the world in the vast majority of markets we track, including Greater China and many emerging markets, and we had June quarter revenue records in more than two dozen countries and regions, including the US, Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, the Middle East, India and South Asia," Cook says. CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh are on the call and will begin by reading through prepared remarks. Here are the key numbers: We'll be looking closely at how Apple performed in China, where it's faced sales pressure in recent years from local smartphone makers. CEO Tim Cook has called China "the most competitive market in the world." Apple competes against Huawei, Oppo, Xiaomi, and others in the region. Wall Street analysts are expecting Greater China revenue of $15.19 billion. Apple has made multiple announcements around US investments since Donald Trump was re-elected. The latest is the coming opening of the Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit. "Beginning August 19, Apple, in partnership with Michigan State University, will host small and medium-sized businesses from across the country in Detroit for various workshops with Apple experts," the company announced. "The courses are designed to help American companies transition to advanced manufacturing by implementing artificial intelligence and smart manufacturing techniques." Earlier this month, Apple announced a $500 million investment in a US magnets manufacturer, MP Materials, which sent the supplier's stock soaring. Apple is hiring for hundreds of roles in machine learning and AI. Apple doesn't disclose its salary info publicly. But to get a sense of what Apple can pay for various roles, the federal filings they make when hiring outside of the US can give clues to its pay ranges. While it's not a complete picture, as the data only refers to foreign hires and doesn't include equity or other benefits employees can receive on top of their base pay, it's an interesting window into the company's comp. For example, Apple's salary filings show a machine learning engineer or researcher can take home as much as $312,200, while a human interface designer can earn as much as $468,500. Check out more details about Apple's salaries here. We're about 30 minutes out from the closing bell, shortly after which Apple will report last quarter's earnings. Shares of Apple have been fairly flat today in the lead-up to the report, falling 0.17%. Over the last five trading days, the stock is down 2.73%. If investors view the report positively, Apple could join the party started by Microsoft and Meta yesterday, both of which jumped at least 9% in after-hours trading after results were released. In addition to further insight on AI strategy, analysts may be listening to the earnings call for clues on potential price increases. While Apple has held off on raising iPhone prices, Jefferies analysts expect the company to hike the price of some iPhone 17 models by $50 when the lineup is released to help cover tariff costs. Jefferies assumes 40% of the iPhone 17 will be made in China for US consumers. If the average cost to build it goes up by $20 to $25, a $50 bump in price "may barely cover the above cost increases, the analysts wrote. Other analysts, like EMARKETER's Jacob Bourne, said iPhones could get more expensive depending on whether they're made in China or India. An American-made iPhone is virtually impossible, Business Insider's Peter Kafka wrote. It certainly won't happen without an astronomical boost in price, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives previously said. He estimated that it could be priced at $3,500. Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring doesn't think AI is as crucial to Apple's strategy as other analysts argue. "We continue to believe that investors do not fully appreciate Apple's AI intentions — most often comparing what Apple needs to do in AI with what META, GOOGL, AMZN, and others are doing," Woodring said. "Of course, we acknowledge that Apple might not have fully finalized their own approach to AI, but we also believe that anyone thinking Apple will acquire an AI-powered search engine to 'solve their AI shortfalls' is misguided." He continued: "We recognize the uncertainty around AI means Apple is not near the top of the "AI Beneficiaries" pecking order today, but Apple's core business (selling products and services) is not materially threatened by AI in the near term, and as a result, Apple still has time to right the AI ship." Morgan Stanley still has an "Overweight" rating on the stock with a price target of $235. Wedbush's Dan Ives is another analyst who sees quick progress on AI as crucial for Apple. He said the firm is in danger of falling permanently behind in the AI race if it doesn't change course soon. "In the AI Revolution there is an arms race going on between Big Tech stalwarts Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, OpenAI, Oracle and many others to monetize the biggest tech trend in the last 50 years.....while Apple is at a highway rest stop on a bench watching this 4th Industrial Revolution race go by at 100 miles an hour," Ives wrote earlier this month. Ives said Apple should jump on the Perplexity deal and that if it acts quickly, the company can still catch up to competitors. He said such a move would be a "no-brainer" for Apple. Wedbush has a $270 price target for Apple stock. After setbacks and delays to its expected AI-driven Siri, Wall Street was eager to hear at WWDC 2025 about the company's plans to stay competitive in the AI arms race. While Apple did introduce some new Apple Intelligence features, like AI-powered personalized shortcuts on Mac, it also reiterated that it "needed more time to reach our high-quality bar" and more will be launched in the coming year. The keynote mainly focused on "Liquid Glass," a glass-like software design coming to Apple's gadget lineup this fall. Investors think Apple is behind on its AI efforts and will be watching to see if CEO Tim Cook signals any shifts in strategy. Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes said to listen for potential updates on the rumored possibility that Apple buys Perplexity AI to help with its upgrade of Siri. Such a move could send the share price soaring, he said, as the company looks for ways to make its products' interface smoother for users. "It does feel like the market would reward Apple for being bolder, which could result in several hundreds of billions in value," Reitzes wrote in a July 21 note. Melius has a $240 price target on Apple stock. President Donald Trump's demand for American-made iPhones has become a tariff headache for Apple. To avoid hefty tariff costs from manufacturing in China, the tech giant is ramping up production in India to make more US iPhones outside the region it once heavily relied on. Smartphones assembled in India made up 44% of US imports in Q2, a jump from the 13% during the same period in 2024, research firm Canalys estimated in an analysis published on Monday. "For the June quarter, we do expect the majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin," CEO Tim Cook said during the May 1 earnings call. The iPhone maker is also looking for American options for its supply chain. On July 15, it announced a $500 million investment in MP Materials, a US producer of rare earth magnets. The deal was a part of Apple's initiative to spend $500 billion in the US over the next four years. In a note earlier this week, Bank of America said its clients would be most interested in Apple's Q2 and future estimated profit margins for clues about how the company, with its sprawling global supply chains, will be able to navigate the trade war. BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan says tariffs should have a "meaningful negative impact" on Apple's profits. One thing that could counteract a hit to margins, however, is the release of a slimmer iPhone, Mohan said. The company could announce the product, which they would likely sell for a higher price than previous iPhones, in September. "We expect the slim iPhone to replace the Plus model from last year and be priced $100 higher vs the Plus model," Mohan wrote. BofA has a "Buy" rating on Apple stock, and expects it to climb to $235 a share within the next 12 months. Third quarter Source: Bloomberg data Jump to

Full Content:
Nick Lichtenberg is Fortune Intelligence editor and was formerly Fortune's executive editor of global news. Apple’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June left some of Wall Street’s most prominent voices feeling oddly nostalgic—and not in a good way. According to Dan Ives, a top tech analyst at Wedbush Securities known for his prescient, albeit oft-times bullish, calls on Silicon Valley’s giants, was bearish about Apple. The atmosphere at this year’s WWDC, he wrote in a July 30 research note, “felt like an episode out of ‘Back to the Future’”—especially when it came to Apple’s treatment of artificial intelligence. While fellow tech titans are racing to put AI front and center, Apple’s WWDC presentation was notable for its near silence on the subject. “Barely no mention of AI,” Ives remarked in his latest report, calling it “the elephant in the room.” He noted this was a stark contrast to the fever pitch seen at rival developer events. Analysts, investors, and developers tuned in with expectations of a grand reveal that would clarify Apple’s ambitions for the “AI Revolution.” Instead, they watched as the company leaned on traditional strengths—hardware updates and a strong services story—leaving the future of Siri and Apple’s broader AI roadmap conspicuously vague. This omission has become a growing concern for analysts like Ives, who believe Apple is at a crossroads. “It’s becoming crystal clear that any innovation around AI at Apple is not coming from inside the walls of Apple Park,” he wrote, referencing the company’s famed Cupertino headquarters. While Apple has historically prided itself on building transformative technology in-house, Ives argues those days may be over. “The time has come” for a big acquisition, he wrote, singling out Perplexity as a “no brainer” acquisition target—even if it costs upwards of $40 billion. According to Ives, such a move could instantly supercharge Apple’s lagging AI platform and help reposition Siri as the “next AI gateway for consumers.” To date, Apple’s biggest acquisition remains Beats, a $3 billion deal in 2014—an order of magnitude smaller than the types of deals transforming the AI sector today. Apple’s traditionally cautious approach to M&A, Ives suggests, may be holding it back at a time when speed is everything. “AI technology on the enterprise and consumer landscape is happening at such a rapid pace Apple will not be able to catch up with an internally built solution,” he warned. The stakes, Ives estimates, are high: A successful AI monetization strategy could add as much as $75 per share to Apple’s valuation. “We believe [CEO Tim] Cook needs to rip the band-aid off and finally do an M&A deal,” he wrote. The muted AI narrative at WWDC comes during a broader period of transition for Apple. While demand for iPhones—a bellwether for the company—remains globally robust, with particular improvement in China after a year of tough competition, the company faces mounting headwinds. Trade tensions, evolving supply chain risks, and increasing pressure from lower-priced rivals in Asia have stressed Apple’s core markets. For now, analysts are keeping faith with Apple’s near-term performance. Wedbush maintains its “Outperform” rating, with a 12-month price target of $270 per share, citing expected growth driven by the upcoming iPhone 17 and continued strength in services. The stock was trading at $211.27 at the time of writing. But Ives is steadfast: the next chapter—centered on AI—will define Apple’s future. To be clear, Cook has had a legendary run after succeeding Steve Jobs in 2011. Over the ensuing 14 years, Cook has led Apple through a period of extraordinary shareholder value creation—transforming a $300 billion company into a $3.2 trillion titan. Under his stewardship, Apple refined its operational efficiency, reinvigorated its services division, and delivered massive profits through established hits like the iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch. But as Fortune‘s Geoff Colvin reported, “suddenly his weaknesses are on display in the AI era.” A chorus of analysts has joined Ives in arguing that Cook’s operational excellence and supply-chain mastery may not be enough to win the future, as the AI era upends the tech industry’s priorities. The first half of 2025, furthermore, has been bruising. The company’s stock is down about 16%, while rivals like Microsoft and Alphabet have soared on aggressive bets in generative AI. Apple’s “Apple Intelligence” initiative, which was supposed to position Siri and other features at the forefront of consumer AI, has failed to capture investor or developer enthusiasm. Meanwhile, key AI executives have left: Apple’s top AI executive Ruoming Pang recently defected to Meta, just weeks after another top Apple AI scientist, Tom Gunter, resigned. Simultaneously, Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams—a long-touted Cook successor—is set to retire, forcing a broader management overhaul. These departures have intensified debate about Apple’s innovation pipeline. Critics argue that under Cook, Apple has not delivered any genuinely transformative new product since the Jobs era, with most recent hits—like AirPods or the Apple Watch—refining rather than redefining product categories. The risk, analysts warn, is existential: If smart devices shift into new AI-centric paradigms and Apple fails to respond forcefully, the company’s platform risks obsolescence. Research firm LightShed Partners rocked investors and the tech press in July by calling for a regime change. Analysts Walter Piecyk and Joe Galone insisted Apple needs a product-focused CEO, not one centered on logistics. They warned Apple’s lack of compelling innovation in AI and the relatively stagnant progression of Siri could irreversibly erode its competitive edge as Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI press forward. Cook’s defenders argue Apple has a unique position: its platform lock-in gives it time to execute a measured AI response. And historically the company has rarely been first-mover—its success derives from perfecting existing technologies, not inventing them. Nevertheless, with AI’s foundational impact compared to the internet or electricity, allowing the competition to set the pace could be dangerous. Ives is still backing Cook, with reservations. “Patience is wearing thin among investors and importantly developers,” he warned. The coming months, particularly as Apple’s product cycle heats up in September and beyond, may prove pivotal—not just for the company’s balance sheet. Ives said Wedbush believes Cook will be Apple CEO for another five years, at least, but there are mounting challenges, from the “tariff iPhone quagmire,” with Apple’s manufacturing operations in China directly exposed to trade uncertainty, to President Donald Trump’s displeasure with India as an alternate supply chain solution, to “missing the AI foundational strategy.” He concluded, “this chapter will define Cook’s legacy.” “It’s time for Cook and Cupertino to face the new reality of this quickly morphing AI-driven tech landscape,” Ives wrote. “Because if they do not change, it will be a historic strategic black eye for Apple in our view.” For this story, Fortune used generative AI to help with an initial draft.

ByAdam Sarhan ByAdam Sarhan, Contributor. Meta Platforms is scheduled to report earnings after Wednesday’s close. The stock recently hit a record high near $747.90/share and is currently trading near $702. The stock is prone to big moves after reporting earnings and can easily gap up if the numbers are strong. Conversely, if the numbers disappoint, the stock can easily gap down. To help you prepare, here is what the Street is expecting: The company is expected to report a gain of $5.83/share on $44.69 billion in revenue. Meanwhile, the so-called Whisper number is a gain of $6.18/share. The Whisper number is the Street's unofficial view on earnings. The company has grown its earnings nicely over the last several years. In 2020 the company earned $9.78; in 2021, the company earned $13.77. In 2022, earnings fell to $8.59. Then, in 2023 earnings soared to $15.56. In 2024, earnings jumped to $23.86 and are expected to grow to $25.78 in 2025. In 2026, earnings are expected to grow again to $28.48. Meanwhile, the stock sports a price to earnings ratio of 27 which is 1.1x the S&P 500. Technically, the stock is acting strong and just hit a fresh record high. Currently, the stock is trading 6% below its all-time high which is bullish considering it was down double digits from its record high earlier this year. Near-term support is the 50 day moving average (DMA) line and then the 200 DMA line. The stock can easily gap up and that’s what the bulls want to see after earnings are announced. Conversely, the bears want to see it gap down and fall. Meta Platforms, Inc. engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. It operates in two segments, Family of Apps and Reality Labs. The Family of Apps segment offers Facebook, which enables people to share, discuss, discover, and connect with interests; Instagram, a community for sharing photos, videos, and private messages, as well as feed, stories, reels, video, live, and shops; Messenger, a messaging application for people to connect with friends, family, communities, and businesses across platforms and devices through text, audio, and video calls; and WhatsApp, a messaging application that is used by people and businesses to communicate and transact privately. The Reality Labs segment provides augmented and virtual reality related products comprising consumer hardware, software, and content that help people feel connected, anytime, and anywhere. The company was formerly known as Facebook, Inc. and changed its name to Meta Platforms, Inc. in October 2021. The company was incorporated in 2004 and is headquartered in Menlo Park, California. From where I sit, the most important trait I look for during earnings season is how the market and a specific company reacts to the news. Remember, always keep your losses small and never argue with the tape. Disclosure: The stock has been previously featured as a leading stock on my stock market membership site: FindLeadingStocks.com

Title: Meta Q2 earnings updates: Wall Street is bullish, eyeing AI opportunities with stock up 20% this year

Meta's strong earnings sent its stock soaring after hours as CEO Mark Zuckerberg detailed the company's all-in approach to the AI race. The company also made it clear that competing in the AI talent war comes with a hefty price tag. Meta's second-quarter results handily beat analysts' estimates for revenue and earnings per share. Revenue was $47.52 billion, compared to expectations of $44.83 billion. Earnings per share were $7.14, compared to estimates of $5.89. Meta shares were up over 12% in after-hours trading during the analyst call, hitting $780, which would represent an all-time high for the stock. In a reference to Meta's recent AI hiring spree, the company cited employee compensation for "technical talent in priority areas" as its second-largest driver in cost growth, behind infrastructure expenses. Zuckerberg took a bit of a victory lap after the launch of his new Superintelligence Lab, which is run by Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang — a hiring made possible by Meta's eye-watering $15 billion investment in the startup. "We're building an elite, talent-dense team," he said. "I've spent a lot of time building this team this quarter." He referenced the hiring of ex-OpenAI researcher Shengjia Zhao, now chief scientist of Meta's Superintelligence Labs, and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. The Meta CEO is clearly bullish on the idea of leaner AI divisions, praising "the ability for small talent, dense teams to be the optimal configuration for driving frontier research." The company also gave updates on its hit AI Ray-Bans, sales of which are "accelerating" and helped drive a revenue increase of nearly 5% for the Reality Labs division. Zuckerberg said that glasses will be "the ideal form factor for AI," echoing his vision he outlined in a letter earlier in the day about "personal superintelligence." On the advertising front, Meta CFO Susan Li said that nearly 2 million advertisers have used the company's AI video generation and image tools. Scroll on for the highlights from Meta's analyst call: Analysts are pleased with Meta's results. William Blair analysts titled their post-earnings note "Massive Quarter Fueled by AI Advancements" and shared key reasons for their optimism. "The company is demonstrating that it can profitably scale the business while making massive capital investments," they wrote. "We continue to be positive on its AI adoption and benefits to advertisers and believe Meta will be a long-term AI leader. RBC analysts called Meta's performance a "Strong Q2" and highlighted how the company delivered 22% revenue growth at the "high-end of guidance and expectations." And Wedbush's tech analyst Dan Ives, a perennial tech bull, expressed his approval in a post on X. "We have been talking about the AI Revolution for years but tonight was a night the tech world and the Street will remember for a long time," he wrote. "The jaw dropping numbers from Redmond and Meta speaks to the AI Revolution hitting its next stage of hyper growth," he added, referring to Microsoft and Meta results. "I think in the future, if you don't have glasses that have AI or some way to interact with AI, I think you'd probably be at a pretty significant cognitive disadvantage compared to other people," Zuckerberg says. Glasses will be the "ideal way to blend the physical and digital worlds together," he predicts, mentioning the metaverse. (Note: This appears to be the only mention of the "metaverse" in the earnings call; many people will remember when the metaverse was a big buzzword in Meta's earnings. Looks like that's "superintelligence" now.) Meta's stock is trading up 12% to $778 after hours, a record level for the company. Zuckerberg talks about the smaller size of Meta's new Superintelligence Labs team. It's an echo of what he's said about building lean teams focused on efficiency. He praises "the ability for small talent, dense teams to be the optimal configuration for driving frontier research." It breaks from how the company operates in other divisions, he notes. "If you look at like what we do in Instagram or Facebook or our ad system, we can very productively have many hundreds or 1000s of people basically working on improving those systems," he says. "But I think for this, for the leading research on superintelligence, you really want the smallest group that can hold the whole thing in their head." Zuckerberg says he doesn't believe his thinking on open-source has particularly changed. Zuckerberg expects to continue to ship open-source products, though there are some challenging considerations with open-sourcing at this scale, he says. "We're getting models that are so big that they're just not practical for a lot of other people to use. So we kind of wrestle with whether it's productive or helpful to share that, or if that's really just primarily helping competitors or something like that," he says. The bottom line, Zuckerberg says, is he expects to continue to ship open-source products, but not every product will be — which he says is a continuation of Meta's approach to open-source. "There's just a very high chance it seems like the world is going to look pretty different in a few years from now," Zuckerberg notes. "The more aggressive assumptions, or the fastest assumptions, have been the ones that have most accurately predicted what would happen." The stock price hits $771 as questions with Wall Street analysts begin. Li says the company continues to focus on head count growth in its "highest priority areas." "We've had a particular emphasis on recruiting leading talent within the industry as we build out Meta Superintelligence Labs to accelerate our AI model development and product initiatives," she says. Turning to AI-related infrastructure costs, Meta also expects to "ramp our investments significantly in 2026" for infrastructure. "Nearly 2 million advertisers are now using our video generation features, image animation, and video expansion, and we're seeing strong results with our text generation tools as we continue to add new features," CFO Susan Li says. In the second quarter, the company started testing AI-powered translations to 10 different languages, she adds. Meta says Reality Labs revenue, its segment that includes its AI hardware as well as virtual and augmented reality headsets, is up nearly 5% — thanks to sales of its AI Ray-Bans. Zuckerberg says that he thinks AI glasses will be "the main way" that the company integrates personal superintelligence into people's daily lives. The Meta CEO says the company has built an "elite" team of AI researchers and engineers, highlighting the hire of Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang, who leads the new lab. "We're building an elite, talent-dense team," he said. "I've spent a lot of time building this team this quarter." He also referenced the hiring of ex-OpenAI researcher Shengjia Zhao, chief scientist of Meta's Superintelligence Labs and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. The company has noted in its earnings release that employee compensation for adding technical talent in "priority areas" (read AI) is its second-greatest driver of cost growth. CEO Mark Zuckerberg is on the call, along with CFO Susan Li. "Meta's blowout earnings and raised guidance highlight how AI is becoming a real revenue driver, not just hype," said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com. "From ad targeting to content discovery, Meta is showing how to deploy AI at scale — and Wall Street is rewarding it. The company's continued heavy investment in AI infrastructure signals it's playing the long game and betting big on foundational models and compute power." Minda Smiley, senior analyst at EMARKETER, a sister company of Business Insider, said the company's strong quarter shows it "not only weathered but perhaps even benefitted from economic instability in recent months" and that the digital ads market more broadly "might not yet feel the pain from tariffs, though that could change." And while Meta continues pouring money into its AI ambitions, "Meta's exorbitant spending on its AI visions will continue to draw questions and scrutiny from investors who are eager to see returns," Smiley said. The company revised its ranges on total expenses and capital expenditures it forecasts for 2025, narrowing its estimates. Its total expense outlook, previously $113 to $118 billion, is now $114 to $118 billion for the year. (That's growth of 20 to 24% year-over-year.) Meta also narrowed its capex range, from $64 to $72 billion previously to $66 to $72 billion for the year. It says it also expects "another year of similarly significant capital expenditures dollar growth in 2026." Those AI talent wars you've been reading about? They're real — and expensive — Meta says. Not in those words, exactly. But that's clearly what the company is getting at in today's note to investors, where it acknowledged that all that spending is indeed going to show up on its financial statements. "While we are still very early in planning for next year, there are a few factors we expect will provide meaningful upward pressure on our 2026 total expense growth rate," Meta said. "The largest single driver of growth will be infrastructure costs, driven by a sharp acceleration in depreciation expense growth and higher operating costs as we continue to scale up our infrastructure fleet." "Aside from infrastructure, we expect the second largest driver of growth to be employee compensation as we add technical talent in priority areas," Meta added. That said, Meta says its overall organization got smaller in the last quarter. It currently employs 75,945 people, down about 1% from the 76,834 it reported in Q1. —Peter Kafka Second quarter Advertising rev. $46.56 billion, +21% y/y, estimate $44.07 billion Family of Apps revenue $47.15 billion, +22% y/y, estimate $44.4 billion Reality Labs revenue $370 million, +4.8% y/y, estimate $386 million Other revenue $583 million, +50% y/y, estimate $500.6 million Operating income $20.44 billion, +38% y/y, estimate $17.24 billion Family of Apps operating income $24.97 billion, +29% y/y, estimate $22.16 billion Reality Labs operating loss $4.53 billion, +0.9% y/y, estimate loss $4.86 billion Average price per ad +9% vs. +10% y/y, estimate +7.58% Source: Bloomberg data Meta's hardware sales could be key to watch in light of some new developments since the company's last earnings call. In June, Zuckerberg unveiled new Oakley Meta glasses, similar to Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses but branded as "performance AI glasses" geared toward athletes. Earlier this week, EssilorLuxottica, which makes Ray-Ban and Oakley, said revenue from sales of Meta's Ray-Bans more than tripled year-over-year. Wall Street was impressed with Meta's demo of its Orion augmented reality glasses prototype in September, though the glasses aren't expected to launch to consumers before 2027. Any update on the expected timeline for the more advanced AI smart glasses, which included integrated displays in the lenses, would be of interest to investors. Meta stock edged 0.6% lower Wednesday afternoon as investors prepared to parse the company's quarterly results. Shares of the tech giant are up 19% year-to-date. You can expect AI to be a heavy focus on this earnings call. (What else is new?) The company is allocating billions in capital expenditures toward infrastructure, talent, and other costs to support its AI ambitions. Meta has been in an all-out talent war for the biggest names in AI, poaching some competitors from rival firms with million-dollar bonuses. The company in June announced a new AI division called Superintelligence Labs. The company took a 49% stake in Scale AI for nearly $15 billion to make Scale founder Alexandr Wang Meta's new chief AI officer. — Sarah Jackson Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research, wrote this month that investors will likely be most interested in three things heading into Meta's earnings call: Still, Zino said he expects Meta to meet its expected revenue targets for the second and third quarters, largely due to increased stability in the digital ad market. CFRA reiterated its "Buy" rating on the stock and lifted its price target to $800 from $750, implying 12% upside from current levels. Zuckerberg kicked off the company's earnings day by sharing his vision on superintelligence, which he believes is "now in sight." His memo Wednesday outlined his hope for a future where everyone has "a personal superintelligence that helps you achieve your goals." "Personal superintelligence that knows us deeply, understands our goals, and can help us achieve them will be by far the most useful," he wrote. "Personal devices like glasses that understand our context because they can see what we see, hear what we hear, and interact with us throughout the day will become our primary computing devices." (Of course, it's worth noting that Meta sells various smart glasses.) — Sarah Jackson Meta could lift its capital expenditures even higher as it ploughs more money into AI and superintelligence projects, analysts at Citizens wrote. "With Meta making material investments in its superintelligence team, including researchers and compute, we believe the company is going through a significant investment cycle and we expect 2026 CapEx to surprise the Street as Meta builds multiple 1GQ or greater data centers," they said, estimating capex could come in around $91 billion next year. Stocks typically don't benefit when a company is going through an investment cycle, analysts said, but the situation could be different for Meta, as AI can enhance the ad experience for users. The firm reiterated its "Market Outperform" rating and $750 price target on the stock, implying 5% upside from current levels. Needham had a mixed view of Meta headed into its second-quarter earnings. On the one hand, the firm's analysts upgraded their rating for the stock from "Underperform" to "Hold," citing two positive catalysts: Still, the firm sees a few risks ahead that held it back from rating the stock a "buy." Those include pressure on Meta's margins and free-cash flow, potentially higher-than-expected total labor costs due to stock-based compensation, and Meta's use of several strategies in its business, which "wastes capital and adds risks," analysts said. Oppenheimer said it sees a handful of risks looming for Meta stock. Oppenheimer reiterated its "Outperform" rating on the stock and lifted its price target to $775 a share, implying 9% upside from current levels. Bank of America called Meta a "Top Online ad stock" for 2025 in a note this month. That's because the company looks best-positioned to reap the benefits from AI-driven advertising, analysts wrote, which they believe could support a higher valuation for the stock. In a separate note, analysts said they expected Meta to beat consensus estimates for second-quarter earnings, pointing to positive checks the bank conducted on Meta's advertising business. Revenue could come in around $45.5 billion, they estimated, at the higher end of Meta's guidance for the quarter. The bank reiterated its "Buy" rating on Meta. Earlier this month, it lifted its price target for the stock to $775 from $765, which implies 9% upside from current levels. Second Quarter Third Quarter Full year Source: Bloomberg data Jump to

Title: Is this TV's endgame? A discussion with analyst Rich Greenfield.

Time Published: 2025-07-30T10:01:01Z

The TV business is not slowing down this summer: Any day now, David and Larry Ellison will finally buy Paramount, with its collection of once-storied TV networks like CBS and MTV. A few weeks later, ESPN and Fox — the last two big TV players that haven't launched their own streamers — will launch their own streamers. But on the other hand, the TV business has been slowing down for a decade: Every quarter, more cable TV subscribers cut the cord, or never sign up for a cord in the first place. The people who own cable TV networks don't seem to have any plan to deal with the issue, other than trying to sell their cable TV networks. Lightshed analyst Rich Greenfield has been chronicling the industry's massive, internet-driven change for years. I caught up with him on my Channels podcast to talk through the particular challenges — and perhaps some opportunities — facing TV right now. Here's an edited excerpt of our chat. Peter Kafka: When the music business collapsed back in the Napster era, it happened basically overnight. But TV has hung on for much longer, even though consumer behavior changed pretty significantly over the last decade. Is there something specific about the TV industry that's allowed these guys to move in slow motion? Rich Greenfield: There's very few businesses where you can raise the price on a product that consumers are using less and less every day. The brilliance of the cable TV business model was the big fat bundle. It's a pretty incredible business to put all of these channels together, even if people don't want most of them. It had everything you wanted and no alternatives, which is very different than where we are today. One of my soapboxes is when I hear people saying they wish we could go back to the cable days. And I keep saying, that was terrible. You guys forget. Everyone hated that. I think consumers are pretty adept at managing their services, and I don't hear a lot of complaints. Sometimes it's like, "Where is this game?" Or "How do I find this thing?" It can be a little confusing. But think about your cellphone. You've had one for quite a while now. Managing the apps and deleting something if you're not using it and adding something —these are all pretty easy functions. We don't give consumers enough credit. They're pretty adept at figuring out cheaper solutions and ways to manage. I want to ask you about a few specific companies. The Paramount deal is finally going to close. What do you think the new owners — David Ellison and his father, Larry Ellison — will do once they have control? Will it change overnight, or is this a slow-rolling thing? It will certainly change. The juxtaposition is sort of amazing. [Paramount, under current owner Shari Redstone, is a] financially strapped company, with challenged financial ownership. And you're moving to an ownership team that is one of the wealthiest families on planet Earth. David Ellison is probably going to be running this company for 30, 40 years. He obviously has a passion for entertainment. He's moving to a much bigger stage. But this is still a financially struggling company. He can't fix the trends of what consumer behavior is changing. What he can do is invest and really build. And you saw the "South Park" deal they just cut, where they're spending hundreds of millions of dollars to move the show [exclusively] to Paramount+. I think it's a small sign of the post-merger strategy, which is that David Ellison is not just doing this to cut costs and squeeze more juice out of this existing company. His goal is to build something significant with a very long-term perspective, which is going to require a lot of investment. What does that look like? Is the new Paramount just a film studio and a streaming service and CBS — and Ellison sells off everything that's not those things? I think initially they'll say they need the cash flow from cable and will use that cash flow to reinvest. I would be shocked if you didn't see more sports on CBS. I think they will be a contender for UFC rights. You've seen David Ellison multiple times in the past year sitting in the front row, cage side with Ari Emanuel [CEO of TKO Group, which owns UFC], and with [UFC CEO] Dana White. And Donald Trump. I don't disagree there on politics. But I also think he likes the content. I think he's going to spend a lot of money. He understands the tech North Star — whether we're talking about TikTok, Meta, Netflix, or Spotify — it's all about time spent. I think David gets that Paramount+ needs a heck of a lot more time spent. The only way you're gonna get there is a better product and more content. Let's move to Disney. Sometime in the next few weeks, before college football and the NFL starts, ESPN will finally be something you can buy as a stand-alone streaming service. If they rolled this out in 2015, we would have said it's a really big deal. Is it a big deal in 2025? At $30 a month, I don't think this is a huge deal. My guess is it gives them flexibility to start packaging this with other services. They can probably get some subscribers. Not a lot. It's probably low to mid-single-digit millions. Not millions and millions. Remember, they're giving the new service to everybody who already subscribed to [pay TV]. So 65 million-plus ESPN subscribers are going to get this new ESPN app at no additional cost. So who is the audience for this? You're not subscribing to the big bundle. You're a pretty passionate sports fan. You're willing to spend $30 a month for sports. My guess is it's just a small number. It actually makes sense to do it. But I don't think, at the end of the day, it is a huge needle-mover. What's going to matter to Disney stock is their theme park business and their cruise ship business. Those being better than expected — because of the state of the economy and what's happened with tariffs not being as problematic as feared a few months ago — is far more important to Disney than what happens with the ESPN streaming rollout. We're also close to the launch of Fox's own streamer, Fox One. The main assets there are Fox Sports — which is really the NFL — and Fox News. Do you think Fox thinks this is primarily a product for people who want to watch football, or do you think it's primarily for Fox News fans? I think this is a pretty limited offering for a sports fan. So does that lead you to believe that Fox thinks this is really a Fox News product? I think you'll see more uptake from Fox News viewers. In the old days, you would have said that Fox News has a very old audience. And the idea that its audience is going to stream it doesn't make sense. But maybe that's not true in 2025? Streaming's become pretty normalized. When you look at how many subscribers Netflix now has, I don't think streaming is some elitist thing. I think it's pretty normalized. I think the part you may be missing is that the Fox News audience is also widening out. And as you make it available to people on streaming, you may pick up some younger people. Maybe it's more interesting during election years. It creates flexibility. And I don't think there's a whole lot of downside. All the basic cable networks are in freefall. Everyone who owns them is trying to sell them — either directly to another buyer or, in the case of Comcast's Versant, trying to bundle it up as a publicly traded stock. Who is a buyer for cable networks? I don't think there are enough people talking about this topic. So many of the investors I deal with, or even industry executives I talk to, think you're going to see Paramount do a deal with Warner Bros. Or maybe you'll see Versant merge with some of the Paramount cable networks. But let's just step back. I think David Ellison and Larry Ellison have a much bigger plan than aggregating more linear cable networks. I would be surprised if that was the strategy. I think there's a much bigger plan that the Ellison family is probably thinking about that goes well beyond just aggregating more legacy media assets. WarnerMedia merged with Discovery, which hasn't created value. CBS and Viacom became Paramount, and that hasn't created value. Disney bought most of Fox's cable networks, and that hasn't created value. Putting legacy assets together that are in secular decline doesn't work. Maybe it might've been worse [without those deals]. But that's not compelling for a buyer. It's a reason to be a seller. As a buyer, there's lots of things you could buy and lots of places you could go. The idea that buying more of these assets so that you have more costs to cut doesn't seem really compelling. Another reason you are skeptical about big media consolidation is politics. You think that either antitrust politics, or Donald Trump's personal politics, make that unlikely. The only media mogul he wasn't complaining about was Rupert Murdoch, and now he's suing Murdoch. Is there a world where anyone sells or buys a meaningful media asset while Donald Trump is president? I think it's going to be challenging. Jump to

Title: Knock ’em On Their SaaS; Spotify Misses The Spot

Don’t Give Me Your SaaS The software as a service (SaaS) business model has become synonymous with integration and interoperability. One SaaS business usually connects to other SaaS businesses. But not so much anymore, writes Keynes Digital Founder and CEO Dan Larkman at AdMonsters. Wall Street investors and venture capitalists jumped on the SaaS startup bandwagon in a big way. Investors like subscription revenue because it’s seen as more durable and reliable. The Trade Desk, which is not a SaaS company, is at the whims of fickle marketers and agencies. That’s why, when the market sours or things go south for a brand, it’s ad tech and marketing that gets hosed. Unlike a SaaS model, advertisers can easily dial those budgets back. However, Larkman notes, SaaS vendors may have seeded their own destruction. The model worked when the focus was on easy interoperability and the ecosystem. That meant companies had to really earn their SaaS checks. The new focus in SaaS land seems to be around creating switching costs that make it harder to drop a vendor, often by revoking some former interoperability or open data API. Weak Spot Spotify’s stock price dipped 10% on Tuesday after the company missed its earnings expectations for Q2 and dialed back revenue projections for 2025, CNBC reports. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek blamed the shortfall on the company’s late-blooming (or not-so-blooming) advertising business. While streaming media and social platform ads are booming, Spotify’s ad revenue saw only 5% yearly growth (from a relatively smaller base). Advertising lagged far behind Spotify’s overall revenue growth rate of 15%. “The one area that hasn’t yet met our expectations is our ads business,” Ek said. “We’ve simply been moving too slowly, and it’s taken longer than expected to see the improvements we initiated take hold.” Although Spotify has grown its monthly advertiser base by 40% YOY, it still has plenty of headroom in terms of programmatic and direct demand, says Co-President and Chief Business Officer Alex Norström. “With the heavy lifting on our ad tech largely complete, we’re now focused on driving adoption,” Norström says. The plan for driving demand includes more campaign automation and a continued emphasis on video. Spotify’s ad biz is also looking for new leadership. Global head of ad sales Lee Brown is taking on the CRO role at DoorDash, which was announced on Monday. Brown has “done great things for Spotify,” Norström told an investor. “But right now, we need to accelerate the transformation of this business.” We Like Sportz Sports programming is the driving force behind this year’s upfront cycle. On Tuesday, Disney announced that sports ad volume across its linear and addressable businesses will near $4 billion for the 2025-2026 season. Similarly, The Wrap recently reported that Fox earned $2 billion in sports-specific upfront revenue, excluding the World Cup; and although NBCU didn’t disclose specifics, it reportedly saw a 45% year-over-year increase in sports ad volume. Perhaps this might be why sports streamer Fubo, which hasn’t been doing so hot lately, decided to post its preliminary second quarter results in advance of its actual earnings date on August 8. The results, better than expected, come as Fubo’s merger with Disney’s Hulu + Live TV is pending. According to Deadline, the deal is likely to close sooner than anticipated. Even by Q4 this year. Total revenue for Q2 exceeded prior guidance in both North America ($365 million) and the rest of the world ($8 million), and the company is apparently on track to achieve its first quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA.

Title: GraniteShares Announces Reverse Split of CONI

July 29, 2025 17:31 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, July 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a reverse share split for the GraniteShares 2x Short COIN (the “Fund”). The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of the reverse split. After the close of the markets on August 14, 2025 (the “Payable Date”), the Fund will effect a reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: Effective after the close of markets on the Payable Date, the Fund’s CUSIP will change as noted in the table below: The reverse share split will apply to shareholders of record as of the close of the NASDAQ Stock Market. (the “NASDAQ”) on August 14, 2025 (the “Record Date”), and payable after the close of the NASDAQ on the Payable Date. Shares of the Funds will begin trading on the NASDAQ on a reverse split-adjusted basis on August 15, 2025 (the “Ex-Date”). On the Ex-Date, the opening market value of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the reverse share split. However, the per share net asset value (“NAV”) and opening market price on the Ex-Date will be approximately twenty-times higher. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical one-for-twenty reverse split anticipated for the Fund: 1-for-20 Reverse Split The Trust’s transfer agent will notify the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) of the reverse split and instruct DTC to adjust each shareholder’s investment(s) accordingly. DTC is the registered owner of the Fund’s shares and maintains a record of the Fund’s record owners. Redemption of Fractional Shares and Tax Consequences of the Reverse Split As a result of the reverse split, a shareholder of the Fund’s shares potentially could hold a fractional share. However, fractional shares cannot trade on the NASDAQ. Thus, the Fund will redeem for cash a shareholder’s fractional shares at the Fund’s split-adjusted NAV as of the Effective Date. Such redemption may have tax implications for those shareholders and a shareholder could recognize a gain or loss in connection with the redemption of the shareholder’s fractional shares. Otherwise, the reverse split will not result in a taxable transaction for holders of Fund shares. No transaction fee will be imposed on shareholders for such redemption.

For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about the Funds, please call (844) 476 8747, or visit the website at www.graniteshares.com.

There can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares in a Fund will develop or be maintained. Shares may trade above or below NAV. Brokerage commissions will apply. Fund Risks Multiple funds have a limited operating history of less than a year and risks associated with a new fund. The Leveraged and Daily Inverse Funds are not suitable for all investors. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by most ETFs and mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with “Long” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with “Short” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates. These and other risks can be found in the prospectus. Investing in physical commodities, including through commodity-linked derivative instruments such as Commodity Futures, Commodity Swaps, as well as other commodity-linked instruments, is speculative and can be extremely volatile and may not be suitable for all investors. Market prices of commodities may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: changes in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, unanticipated or unrealized); weather; agriculture; trade; domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies; diseases; pestilence; technological developments; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction. A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price. The Fund is new with no operating history. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it could ultimately liquidate. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks and losses. This information is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy shares of any Funds to any person in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Please consult your tax advisor about the tax consequences of an investment in Fund shares, including the possible application of foreign, state, and local tax laws. You could lose money by investing in the ETFs. There can be no assurance that the investment objective of the Funds will be achieved.

Title: The Making of Dario Amodei
URL: https://www.bigtechnology.com/p/the-making-of-dario-amodei
Time Published: 2025-07-29T18:36:34Z
Full Content:
Dario Amodei doesn’t hesitate when I ask what’s gotten into him. The Anthropic CEO has spent 2025 at war, feuding with industry counterparts, members of the government, and the public’s perception of artificial intelligence. In recent months, he’s predicted that AI could soon eliminate 50% of entry-level, white-collar jobs. He’s railed against a ten-year AI regulation moratorium in the pages of the New York Times. And he’s called for semiconductor export controls to China, drawing a public rebuke from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. Amid it all, Amodei meets me on the first floor of his company’s downtown San Francisco headquarters. He’s loose, energetic, and anxious to get started, as if he’s been waiting for this moment to address his actions. Sporting a blue shawl-collar sweater over a casual white t-shirt, and boxy thick-rimmed glasses, he sits down and stares ahead. Underlying his efforts, Amodei says, is a firm belief that AI is moving faster than most of us appreciate, making its opportunities and consequences much closer than they appear. “I am indeed one of the most bullish about AI capabilities improving very fast,” he tells me. “As we've gotten more close to AI systems that are more powerful, I've wanted to say those things more forcefully, more publicly, to make the point clearer.” Amodei’s outspokenness and sharp elbows have earned him both respect and derision in Silicon Valley. He’s seen by some as a technological visionary who pioneered OpenAI’s GPT-3 project (the seeds of ChatGPT) and a safety-minded leader who broke off and founded Anthropic. Others see him as a control-oriented “doomer” who wants to slow AI progress, shape it to his liking, and shut out the competition. Love him or hate him, the AI field will have to deal with him. Amodei has turned Anthropic, currently valued at $61 billion, into an economic force. From a zero start in 2021, the company — though still unprofitable — has grown its annualized recurring revenue from $1.4 billion in March 2025 to $3 billion in May to nearly $4.5 billion in July, leading Amodei to call it the “fastest growing software company in history at the scale that it's at.” Perhaps more notable than Anthropic’s revenue is the way it’s coming in. Rather than relying primarily on applications like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Amodei’s biggest bet is on the underlying technology itself. Most of the company’s revenue, Amodei tells me, is earned via its API, or through other companies buying Anthropic’s AI models and using them within their own products. Anthropic will thus be a barometer of AI’s progress, rising and falling on the strength of the technology. As Anthropic grows, Amodei hopes its heft will help him influence the industry’s direction. And given his willingness to speak out, throw a punch, and take one, he’s probably right. So if this man will steer what may be the world’s most influential new technology, it’s worth understanding what drives him, his business, and why his timeline is shorter than so many others’. And after more than two dozen interviews with him, his friends, colleagues, and competitors, I believe I have an answer. Dario Amodei was a science kid. Born in San Francisco in 1983 to a Jewish mother and an Italian father, he was interested almost entirely in math and physics. When the dot-com boom exploded around him in his high school years, it barely registered. “Writing some website actually had no interest to me whatsoever,” he tells me. “I was interested in discovering fundamental scientific truth.” At home, Amodei was very close with his parents, a loving couple who he says sought to improve the world. His mother Elena Engel ran renovation and construction projects for libraries in Berkeley and San Francisco. His father Riccardo Amodei was a trained leathersmith. “They gave me a sense of right and wrong and what was important in the world,” he says, “imbuing a strong sense of responsibility.” That sense of responsibility showed up in Amodei’s undergrad years at Caltech, where he lambasted his fellow students over their passivity toward the forthcoming Iraq war. “The problem isn't that everyone is just peachy with the idea of bombing Iraq; it's that most people are opposed in principle but refuse to give one millisecond of their time,” Amodei wrote in The California Tech, a student newspaper, on March 3, 2003. “This needs to change, right now and without delay.” Then, in his early 20s, Amodei’s life changed forever. His father Riccardo, who’d long fought a rare illness, lost the battle in 2006. Riccardo’s passing shocked Amodei, and he shifted his graduate studies at Princeton from theoretical physics to biology to address human illness and biological problems. The rest of Amodei’s life has, in some ways, been dedicated to addressing his father’s loss, especially because within four years, a new breakthrough turned the illness from something that was 50% fatal to 95% curable. “There was someone who worked on the cure to this disease, that managed to cure it, and save a bunch of people's lives,” Amodei says, “but could have saved even more.” “I get really angry when someone's like, “This guy's a doomer. He wants to slow things down’” - Dario Amodei Amodei’s father’s passing has shaped his life’s path to this day, says Jade Wang, who dated him in the early 2010s. “It's the difference between his father most likely dying and most likely living, okay?,” she says, explaining that had scientific progress sped up a bit, Amodei’s father might still be with us. It just took a while before he found AI as a vessel to do it. Upon recalling his father’s death, Amodei grows animated. His calls for export controls and AI safeguards, he believes, have been mischaracterized as the actions of someone irrationally seeking to impede AI progress. “I get really angry when someone's like, ‘This guy's a doomer. He wants to slow things down,’” Amodei tells me. “You heard what I just said, my father died because of cures that could have happened a few years [earlier]. I understand the benefit of this technology.” At Princeton, still raw from his father’s loss, Amodei began his quest to decode human biology by studying the retina. Our eyes capture the world by sending signals to the visual cortex — a large part of the brain that takes up 30% of the cerebral cortex — which then processes the data and shows us a picture. If you’re looking to tackle the complexity of the human physiology, the retina is a great place to start. “He used the retina to look at a complete neural population and actually understand what every cell was doing, or at least have that opportunity,” Stephanie Palmer, one of Amodei’s contemporaries at Princeton, tells me. “It was about that more than the eye. He wasn't trying to be an ophthalmologist.” Working in Professor Michael Berry’s retina lab, Amodei was so dissatisfied with the methods available to measure the retina’s signals that he co-invented a new, better sensor to pick up more data. This was atypical for the lab, at once impressive and nonconformist. His dissertation won the Hertz Thesis Prize, a prestigious award granted to those who discover real-world applications in their academic work. But Amodei’s penchant for poking at norms, and his strident sense of the way things should be, set him apart in an academic setting. Berry tells me that Amodei was the most talented graduate student he ever had, but his focus on technological progress and teamwork didn’t play well in a system built to recognize individual achievement. “I think internally, he was kind of a proud person,” Berry tells me. “I imagine his whole academic career up until that point, whenever he did something, people would stand up and clap. And that was not really happening here.” “He wasn't trying to be an ophthalmologist.” - Stephanie Palmer When Amodei left Princeton, the door to AI opened. He began postdoc work under researcher Parag Mallick at Stanford, studying proteins in and around tumors to detect metastatic cancer cells. The work was complex, showing Amodei the limits of what people could do alone, and he started looking for technological solutions. “The complexity of the underlying problems in biology felt like it was beyond human scale,” Amodei tells me. “In order to understand it all, you needed hundreds, thousands of human researchers.” Amodei saw that potential in emerging AI technologies. At the time, an explosion of data and computing power was sparking breakthroughs in machine learning, a subset of AI that long held theoretical potential but had shown middling results until then. After Amodei began experimenting with the technology, he realized it might eventually stand in for those thousands of researchers. “AI, which I was just starting to see the discoveries in, felt to me like the only technology that could kind of bridge that gap,” he says, something that “could bring us beyond human scale.” Amodei left academia to pursue AI advancement in the corporate world, which had the cash to support it. He considered founding a startup, then leaned toward Google, which had a well-funded AI research division in Google Brain and just acquired DeepMind. But Chinese search engine Baidu had handed the esteemed researcher Andrew Ng a $100 million budget to research and deploy AI, and he began to form a superteam. Ng reached out to Amodei, who was intrigued and applied. When Amodei’s application arrived at Baidu, the full team didn't know what to do with it. “He had an impressive background, but his background, from our perspective, was in biology. It was not in machine learning,” Greg Diamos, an early member of the team, tells me. Diamos then looked at Amodei’s code from Stanford, and encouraged the team to hire him. “I was thinking, anyone who can write this has got to be an amazingly good programmer,” he says. Amodei joined Baidu in November 2014. With their vast resources, the Baidu team could throw computing power and data at problems in an attempt to improve their outcomes. They saw remarkable results. In their experiments, Amodei and his colleagues found that AI’s performance improved meaningfully as they added more of these ingredients. The team released a paper on speech recognition that showed that model size directly correlated with performance. “It had a big impact on me, because I saw these very smooth trends,” Amodei says. Amodei’s early work at Baidu contributed to what’s known as the AI “scaling laws,” which are really more of an observation. The scaling laws state that increasing computing power, data, and model size in AI training leads to predictable performance improvements. Scaling everything up, in other words, makes AI better, no novel methods needed. “This was, to me, the most significant discovery I've seen in my life,” Diamos tells me. To this day, Amodei is perhaps the purest believer in the scaling laws among AI research leaders. While peers like Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis and Meta Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun suggest the AI industry needs further breakthroughs to reach human-level artificial intelligence, Amodei speaks with a certainty — though not complete — that the path forward is clear. And as the industry erects massive data centers the size of small cities, he sees exceptionally powerful AI fast approaching. “I see this exponential,” he says. “When you're on an exponential, you can really get fooled by it. Two years away from when the exponential goes totally crazy it looks like it's just starting.” At Baidu, the AI team’s progress became seeds of its undoing. Turf battles broke out within the company over control of its increasingly valuable technology, know-how, and resources. Eventually, meddling from powerbrokers in China sparked a talent exodus and the lab fell apart. Andrew Ng declined to comment. As Baidu’s AI team crumbled, Elon Musk invited Amodei and a number of leading AI researchers to a now-famous dinner at the Rosewood hotel in Menlo Park. Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, and Ilya Sutskever all attended. Seeing AI’s emerging potential, and concerned Google could solidify control over it, Musk decided to fund a new competitor, which became OpenAI. Altman, Brockman, and Sutskever co-founded the new research house with Musk. Amodei thought about joining, felt unsure about the fledgling organization, and went to Google Brain instead. After ten months stuck in large-company morass at Google, Amodei reconsidered. He joined OpenAI in 2016, and got to work on AI safety. He’d grown interested in safety at Google, where he worried about the rapidly improving technology’s capacity for harm and co-authored a paper on its potential for bad behavior. As Amodei settled in at OpenAI, his former Google colleagues introduced the transformer model, the technology behind today’s generative AI moment, in a paper called “Attention is All You Need.” The transformer enabled faster training and much larger models than prior methods. Despite the discovery’s great potential, Google mostly sat on it. OpenAI, meanwhile, got to work. It released its first large language model called “GPT” (the “T” stands for transformer) in 2018. The model generated often-broken text but still demonstrated meaningful improvement over previous language generation methods. Amodei, who’d become a research director at OpenAI, got directly involved in the next iteration, GPT-2, which was effectively the same model as GPT, just bigger. The OpenAI team fine-tuned GPT-2 with a technique called reinforcement learning with human feedback, something Amodei helped pioneer, which helped guide its values. GPT-2 delivered much better results than GPT, as expected, showing an ability to paraphrase, write, and answer questions somewhat coherently. Language models soon became the focal point at OpenAI. As Amodei’s profile increased within OpenAI, so did the controversy around him. A prolific writer, he’d produce long documents about values and technology, which some colleagues saw as inspirational but others saw as flag planting and heavy handed. (One such memo: an exploration of “M” companies vs. “P” companies, where Ms provide market-focused goods and Ps provide public-focused goods). Amodei, to some, was also too focused on maintaining secrecy around the technology’s potential and collaborating with the government to address it. And he could be a bit abrasive, sometimes disparaging projects he didn’t believe in. OpenAI still entrusted Amodei with the leadership of the GPT-3 project, handing him 50-60% of the entire company’s compute to build a massively scaled up version of its language model. The jump from GPT to GPT-2 was large, a ten-fold increase. But the jump from GPT-2 to GPT-3 would be massive, a 100x project costing tens of millions of dollars. The results were stunning. The New York Times quoted independent researchers surprised by the GPT-3’s ability to code, summarize, and translate. Amodei, who was relatively restrained upon the release of GPT-2, gushed about his new model. “It has this emergent quality,” he told the Times. “It has some ability to recognize the pattern that you gave it and complete the story.” But cracks beneath the surface at OpenAI began to tear wide open. With the creation of GPT-3, the first capable language model, the stakes for Amodei increased. After seeing the scaling laws work in multiple disciplines at this point, Amodei considered where the technology was headed and developed an even greater interest in safety. “He looked at this technology and assumed it would work,” Jack Clark, a close colleague of Amodei’s at OpenAI, tells me. “And if you assume it works, in the sense that it's going to be as smart as a person, you can't help but be concerned of the safety things in some sense.” Though Amodei led OpenAI’s model development, and directed a good chunk of its compute, parts of the company were out of his hands. This included deciding when to release models, personnel matters, how the company deploys its technology, and how it represents itself externally. “Many of those things,” Amodei says, “are not things that you control just by training the models.” Amodei, by then, had formed a tight-knit group of coworkers around him — which some called “the pandas,” due to his love of the animal — and had very different ideas from OpenAI leadership about how to handle these functions. Infighting ensued, and the factions developed an intense dislike for each other. “He believes that AI is so scary that only they should do it” - Jensen Huang In our conversation, Amodei didn’t mask his feelings. “The leaders of a company, they have to be trustworthy people,” he says. “They have to be people whose motivations are sincere, no matter how much you're driving forward the company technically. If you're working for someone whose motivations are not sincere, who's not an honest person, who does not truly want to make the world better, it's not going to work. You're just contributing to something bad.” Within OpenAI, some saw Amodei’s focus on safety as a route to control the company altogether. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently echoed these criticisms after Amodei called for GPU export controls to China. “He believes that AI is so scary that only they should do it,” Huang said. “That's the most outrageous lie I've ever heard,” Amodei tells me of Huang’s claim, adding he’s always wanted to spark a ‘race to the top’ by encouraging others to emulate Anthropic’s safety practices. “I’ve said nothing that anywhere near resembles the idea that this company should be the only one to build the technology. I don't know how anyone could ever derive that from anything that I've said. It’s just an incredible and bad faith distortion.” My full conversation with Amodei will be live on Big Technology Podcast tomorrow. You can subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or your app of choice. Nvidia, which just won a rollback of some of Amodei’s favored export controls, doubled down. "We support safe, responsible, and transparent AI. Thousands of startups and developers in our ecosystem and the open-source community are enhancing safety,” an Nvidia spokesperson tells me. “Lobbying for regulatory capture against open source will only stifle innovation, make AI less safe and secure, and less democratic. That's not a 'race to the top' or the way for America to win." OpenAI hit back as well, via a company spokesperson. “We’ve always believed that AI should benefit and empower everyone, not just those who say it’s too risky for anyone but themselves to develop safely,” the spokesperson says. “As the technology has evolved, our decisions on partnerships, model releases, and funding have become standard across the industry, including at Anthropic. What hasn’t changed is our focus on making AI safe, useful, and available to as many people as possible.” Over time, the differences between Amodei’s group and OpenAI’s leaders became so untenable that something had to give. “Fifty percent of our time was spent trying to convince other people of views that we held, and fifty percent was spent working,” Clark says. So in December 2020, Amodei, Clark, Amodei’s sister Daniela, researcher Chris Olah, and a handful of others departed OpenAI to start something new. In a conference room within Anthropic offices, Clark turns around his laptop and displays one of Anthropic’s earliest documents. It’s a list of names including Aligned AI, Generative, Sponge, Swan, Sloth, and Sparrow Systems. Anthropic, a word that connotes being human centered and human oriented, is also there, and it also happened to be an available domain name in early 2021. “We like the name it is good,” the team wrote in the spreadsheet. And thus, Anthropic was born. Anthropic was formed in the heart of Covid, meeting entirely on Zoom amid the pandemic’s second wave. Eventually, its 15 to 20 employees would meet for weekly lunches in San Francisco’s Precita Park, pulling up their own chairs to talk business. The company’s early mission was simple: Build leading large language models, implement safe practices to pressure others to follow, and publish what it learned, apart from its models’ core technical details. It might sound odd that the group of less than two dozen people meeting in a park with their own chairs would feel a sense of destiny, especially since they’d need billions of dollars to see their mission through, but that was the vibe in Anthropic’s early days. “The strangest thing about all of this is how inevitable so much of it felt to people on the inside,” Clark says. “We've done scaling laws. We could see the path to the models getting good.” Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt was among Anthropic’s first investors. He’d met Amodei through his then-girlfriend and now wife, who Schmidt knew socially. The two talked technology when Amodei was still at OpenAI, and business when he started Anthropic. Schmidt tells me he invested in the person more than the concept. “At this level, when you're doing an investment like that, you have essentially no data, right?” he says. “You don't know what the revenue is. You don't know the market. You don't know what the product is. And so you fundamentally have to decide based on the people. And Dario is a brilliant scientist, and he promised to hire brilliant scientists, which he did. He promised to lead a very small company doing it, which he did not. Now it's a very large company, and now it's a normal company. I figured it would be a very interesting research lab.” This story took months to report — made possible by our subscribers.

Now-disgraced FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was also among Anthropic’s early investors, directing a reported $500 million from FTX’s coffers for a 13.56% stake in the company. Bankman-Fried was one of a number of effective altruists who invested in Anthropic’s early stages, when the movement and company were close. Amodei says SBF was an AI bull interested in safety, a good fit, but had sufficient red flags to keep him off the board and give him non-voting shares. SBF’s behavior, Amodei says, “turned out to be much, much, much more extreme and bad than I ever imagined.” Amodei’s pitch to prospective investors was simple: He told them Anthropic had the talent to build cutting-edge models at a tenth of the cost. And it worked. To date, Amodei’s brought in nearly $20 billion, including $8 billion from Amazon and $3 billion from Google. “Investors aren't idiots,” he tells me. “They basically understand the concept of capital efficiency.” In Anthropic’s second year, OpenAI introduced generative AI to the world with ChatGPT, but Anthropic took a different path. Rather than focus on consumer applications, Amodei decided Anthropic would sell its technology to businesses. There were two benefits to this strategy. If the models were useful it could be lucrative, and the challenge would prod the company into building better technology. Improving an AI model from undergrad to graduate level in biochemistry might not excite the common chatbot user, Amodei says, but it would be valuable to a pharmaceutical company like Pfizer. “It gives a better incentive to develop the models as far as possible,” he says. Oddly enough, it was an Anthropic consumer product that got businesses to pay attention to its technology. The company released its Claude chatbot in July 2023, nearly a year after ChatGPT’s debut, and it drew rave reviews due to its high-EQ personality (an outgrowth of Anthropic’s safety work). The company, until then, had sought to remain under 150 employees, but soon found itself hiring more people in a day than it employed in total in its entire first year. “It was that Claude chatbot moment when the company started to grow a lot,” Clark says. Amodei’s bet on building AI for business use cases attracted loads of eager customers. Anthropic’s now sold its large language models across multiple industries — travel, healthcare, financial services, insurance, and more — including to leaders like Pfizer, United Airlines, and AIG. The Ozempic-maker Novo Nordisk is, for instance, using Anthropic to condense a fifteen-day regulatory report compilation process into ten minutes. “The technology we've built ends up taking care of a lot of the stuff that people complain the most about their work,” Kate Jensen, Anthropic’s head of revenue, tells me. Coders, meanwhile, have fallen in love with Anthropic. The company focused on AI code generation both because it could help speed its model development and because coders would adopt it quickly if it worked well enough. Sure enough, the use cases exploded and have coincided with — or caused — the rise of AI coding tools like Cursor. Anthropic is also getting into the coding application business itself. It released Claude Code, an AI coding tool, in February 2025. As AI usage booms, the company’s revenue is as well. “Anthropic’s revenue every year has grown 10x,” Amodei says. “We went from zero to $100 million in 2023. We went from $100 million to a billion in 2024. And this year, in this first half of the year, we've gone from $1 billion to I think, as of speaking today, it’s well above $4 [billion], it might be $4.5 [billion].” The last figure is annualized, or 12x the month’s revenue. Anthropic’s 8 and 9 figure deals have tripled in 2025 vs. 2024, the company says, and its business customers have spent 5x more on average. But Anthropic is spending a lot of money to train and run its models, raising questions about whether its business model is sustainable. The company is deeply unprofitable, expected to lose about $3 billion this year. And its gross margins have also reportedly lagged behind typical cloud software companies. Some of Anthropic’s customers are wondering if the company’s attempt to sort out its business is showing up in the product. One startup founder told me that while Anthropic is the best model for his use case, he can’t rely on it because it’s down too often. Amjad Masad, CEO of vibe coding company Replit, told me the cost to use its models has stopped coming down after a period of price decreases. Claude Code also just added additional rate limits after some developers used it so much it became bad business. Entrepreneur and developer Kieran Klaassen tells me that he got $6,000 worth of Claude API usage in one month for just the $200 Max subscription price. Klaassen says he’s run multiple Claude agents at a time. “The real limit comes in your mental capacity to switch from one to the other,” he says. Amodei says that as Anthropic’s models improve, customers will get a better deal if costs stay the same, effectively buying more intelligence per dollar. He also says that AI labs are just beginning to optimize for inference, or the act of using the models, which should lead to efficiency improvements. This is a place to pay attention. Multiple industry sources told me inference costs must drop for the business to make sense. Anthropic’s executives, in their interviews with me, suggest there are worse problems than high demand for your product. The open question is whether generative AI, and the scaling laws that propel it, will neatly follow other technology’s cost reduction curves, or whether it’s a novel technology with a novel cost. The only sure thing is it’ll take a lot more money to find out. At the beginning of 2025, Anthropic needed cash. The AI industry’s hunger for scale had catalyzed massive data center buildouts and compute deals. To support these undertakings, AI labs had repeatedly smashed startup fundraising records. And established companies like Meta, Google, and Amazon used their sizable profits and data centers to build their own models, turning up the pressure. Anthropic has a special imperative to build large. Without a powerhouse application like ChatGPT, where users come back out of habit, its models must lead in their use cases or risk being swapped out for a competitor. “In the corporate space, and especially in coding, there’s very clearly an advantage to be six months or a year ahead of the state of the art,” Box CEO Aaron Levie, an Anthropic customer, tells me. So the company turned to Ravi Mhatre, a veteran venture capitalist and partner at Lightspeed Ventures, to lead a $3.5 billion funding round. Mhatre used to write $5 or $10-million checks, but the one he was readying to cut would be among his firm’s largest. “Amazon went public with a $400 million market cap,” he tells me. “$400 million! Think about that today.” The fundraise was proceeding as planned when a cheap, competing AI model dropped seemingly out of thin air. The Chinese hedge fund High Flyer released DeepSeek R1, an open-source, capable, and efficient reasoning model that it priced forty times lower than its peers. DeepSeek shocked the business world and had multi-trillion-dollar CEOs tweeting Wikipedia articles to calm shareholders. By the time DeepSeek arrived, Mhatre had completed a full projection of why the AI models themselves, not the chatbots of the world, would generate the most value. He concluded that creating artificial intelligence capable of knowledge work would allow companies to have revenue ten times what the large cloud platforms bring in, leading to a total potential market of $15 to 20 trillion. “So then you work backwards and just say, at $60 billion or $100 billion, could you get a venture-style return? You absolutely could,” he says. “Sometimes it's about how you size the markets top-down.” DeepSeek’s arrival suggested that open source, efficient, almost-as-good models could challenge the incumbents, but Amodei didn’t see it that way. His greatest concern, he says, is whether any new model is better than Anthropic’s. If you can download the model’s designs, you still need to set it up on a cloud service and run it, he says, which takes skill and money. Amodei delivered a version of this argument to Mhatre and his colleagues at Lightspeed as the DeepSeek story took off, convincing them that some of the model’s innovations could be improved with scale. That Monday, Nvidia stock dropped 17% as panicked investors fled the AI infrastructure trade. Amid the uncertainty, the VC made a decision. “I'm not going to tell you that it wasn't extraordinarily stressful,” Mhatre says. “That Monday, we wired $1 billion.” Six months after DeepSeek Monday, Anthropic is looking to scale up yet again. The company is in talks for a new funding round that could reach $5 billion which would double its valuation to $150 billion. The potential investors include some middle eastern Gulf states that Anthropic once seemed eager to steer clear of. But after raising nearly $20 billion from Google, Amazon, and VCs like Lightspeed, it’s running out of options for bigger checks. “I'm not going to tell you that it wasn't extraordinarily stressful. That Monday, we wired $1 billion.” - Ravi Mhatre Within Anthropic, Amodei has argued the Gulf states have $100 billion or more in capital to invest, and their cash would help Anthropic stay on the technology’s frontier. He seemed to reluctantly accept the idea of taking the money from dictators in an internal Slack message obtained by Wired. “Unfortunately,” he wrote. “I think ‘No bad person should ever benefit from our success’ is a pretty difficult principle to run a business on.” Speaking with Amodei makes me wonder how, or if, this race to improve AI will end. I imagine the models might eventually get so big, and so good, they commoditize. Or perhaps, as Amodei’s former colleague Ilya Sutskever once suggested, the endless drive to scale ends up covering the planet with solar panels and datacenters. There’s also another possibility, one AI believers don’t like to discuss: AI improvement plateaus, leading to a historic investor wipeout. At Anthropic’s first developer conference in May, I grab a seat a few rows from the stage and await Amodei’s appearance. The company’s packed The Midway — an airy arts and events venue in San Francisco’s Dogpatch neighborhood — with coders, press, and many of its now 1,000+ employees. There’s broad anticipation inside that Anthropic will release Claude 4, its latest, biggest model. Amodei takes the stage and introduces Claude 4. Instead of a flashy presentation, he picks up a handheld mic, makes the announcement, reads his notes from a laptop, and then turns the spotlight over to Anthropic product head Mike Krieger. The crowd seems into it. Amodei’s promise of what’s coming next, to me, is more notable than the model update itself. Throughout the day, he repeatedly mentions that AI development is speeding up, and that Anthropic’s next model releases will come faster. “I don't know exactly how much more frequent,” he says. “But the pace is increasing,” Anthropic, as Amodei’s told me, has been developing AI coding tools to speed up its model development. When I bring this up to Jared Kaplan, the company’s co-founder and chief scientist, he tells me it’s working. “Most engineers at Anthropic use AI to help them be more productive,” he says. “So it's definitely speeding us up quite a bit.” There’s a concept in AI theory called an intelligence explosion, where the model is able to make itself better and then — fffffoooooom — self-improves and become all mighty. Kaplan doesn’t dismiss the notion that an intelligence explosion might arrive via this method, or perhaps a human-assisted version. “It could be two or three years away. Could take longer. Could take much longer,” Kaplan says. “But when I say there’s a 50% chance of AI being able to do all the things that knowledge workers do, one of the things we do is train AI models.” “Maybe people like me won't really have much to do,” Kaplan continues. “It's more complicated than that. But we are quite likely headed towards the future that looks like that.” Amodei’s safety obsession, at this point, comes into clear focus. While nobody within Anthropic says an intelligence explosion is imminent, it’s evident they’re not shying away from moving toward it. If AI is going to get better, faster — and perhaps much faster — it’s worth being careful about its downsides. Some of this theoretical talk clearly helps Anthropic market its services to pharmaceutical companies and developers, but AI models are now coding well enough that it no longer feels completely insane. Jan Leike, the former head of OpenAI’s ‘Superalignment’ team, followed Amodei to Anthropic in 2024 to co-lead its alignment science team. Alignment is the art of tuning AI systems to ensure they are aligned with our values and goals. And Leike believes syncing the machines with our intentions will be crucial should we see the anticipated eruption. “There could be a period of rapid capability progress,” Leike tells me. “You don't want to lose control or lose scalability over a system that's recursively self-improving.” Already, Anthropic and its counterparts have found AI sometimes demonstrates a worrying interest in self-preservation while testing in simulation environments. In Claude 4’s documentation, for instance, Anthropic stated the model repeatedly attempted to blackmail an engineer to avoid being shut down. “You don't want to lose control or lose scalability over a system that's recursively self-improving.” - Jan Leike Anthropic’s also said its AI has worked to deceive evaluators when it thought they might rewrite its values. The model also attempted to copy itself out of Anthropic’s infrastructure in a simulation. Leike says Anthropic is working to discourage these behaviors via reward systems. The field is still experimental. Speaking openly about these issues is part of Amodei’s “race to the top” strategy. Anthropic’s also funded — and advocated for — interpretability, or the science of understanding what takes place within AI models. And it’s published a Responsible Scaling Policy, a framework that sets boundaries for when to release and train models depending on their risks, which has inspired similar efforts among its peers. “The way I think about the race to the top is that it doesn't matter who wins,” Amodei says. “Everyone wins, right?” Amodei’s dedication to AI, forged in the tragedy of his father’s loss, may now have its goal in sight. Today’s AI is already speeding up drug development paperwork, it’s become an (imperfect) medical advisor in a broken medical system, and, if things go right, it may one day stand in for those hundreds or thousands of researchers needed to understand human biology. Could Amodei’s pursuit of this vision, I ask, blind him to the risks of losing control of the technology? “That's not the way I think about it,” he says. “We've gotten better at controlling models with every model that we release. All these things go wrong, but you really have to stress test the models pretty hard.” Amodei sees this line of questioning as rooted in the slow-it-down doomerism he’s often accused of. His plan, contrary to the critics, is to accelerate. “The reason I'm warning about the risk is so that we don't have to slow down,” he says. “I have such an incredible understanding of the stakes. In terms of the benefits, in terms of what it can do, the lives that it can save. I've seen that personally.” Owen Lavine contributed reporting. Demis Hassabis stares intently through the screen when I ask him whether he can save Google. It’s early evening in his native U.K. and the DeepMind founder is working overtime.

Title: Wall Street is bullish on Meta's Q2 performance ahead of its earnings report: 'One of the best AI opportunity stocks'

Meta's strong earnings sent its stock soaring after hours as CEO Mark Zuckerberg detailed the company's all-in approach to the AI race. The company also made it clear that competing in the AI talent war comes with a hefty price tag. Meta's second-quarter results handily beat analysts' estimates for revenue and earnings per share. Revenue was $47.52 billion, compared to expectations of $44.83 billion. Earnings per share were $7.14, compared to estimates of $5.89. Meta shares were up over 12% in after-hours trading during the analyst call, hitting $780, which would represent an all-time high for the stock. In a reference to Meta's recent AI hiring spree, the company cited employee compensation for "technical talent in priority areas" as its second-largest driver in cost growth, behind infrastructure expenses. Zuckerberg took a bit of a victory lap after the launch of his new Superintelligence Lab, which is run by Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang — a hiring made possible by Meta's eye-watering $15 billion investment in the startup. "We're building an elite, talent-dense team," he said. "I've spent a lot of time building this team this quarter." He referenced the hiring of ex-OpenAI researcher Shengjia Zhao, now chief scientist of Meta's Superintelligence Labs, and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. The Meta CEO is clearly bullish on the idea of leaner AI divisions, praising "the ability for small talent, dense teams to be the optimal configuration for driving frontier research." The company also gave updates on its hit AI Ray-Bans, sales of which are "accelerating" and helped drive a revenue increase of nearly 5% for the Reality Labs division. Zuckerberg said that glasses will be "the ideal form factor for AI," echoing his vision he outlined in a letter earlier in the day about "personal superintelligence." On the advertising front, Meta CFO Susan Li said that nearly 2 million advertisers have used the company's AI video generation and image tools. Scroll on for the highlights from Meta's analyst call: Analysts are pleased with Meta's results. William Blair analysts titled their post-earnings note "Massive Quarter Fueled by AI Advancements" and shared key reasons for their optimism. "The company is demonstrating that it can profitably scale the business while making massive capital investments," they wrote. "We continue to be positive on its AI adoption and benefits to advertisers and believe Meta will be a long-term AI leader. RBC analysts called Meta's performance a "Strong Q2" and highlighted how the company delivered 22% revenue growth at the "high-end of guidance and expectations." And Wedbush's tech analyst Dan Ives, a perennial tech bull, expressed his approval in a post on X. "We have been talking about the AI Revolution for years but tonight was a night the tech world and the Street will remember for a long time," he wrote. "The jaw dropping numbers from Redmond and Meta speaks to the AI Revolution hitting its next stage of hyper growth," he added, referring to Microsoft and Meta results. "I think in the future, if you don't have glasses that have AI or some way to interact with AI, I think you'd probably be at a pretty significant cognitive disadvantage compared to other people," Zuckerberg says. Glasses will be the "ideal way to blend the physical and digital worlds together," he predicts, mentioning the metaverse. (Note: This appears to be the only mention of the "metaverse" in the earnings call; many people will remember when the metaverse was a big buzzword in Meta's earnings. Looks like that's "superintelligence" now.) Meta's stock is trading up 12% to $778 after hours, a record level for the company. Zuckerberg talks about the smaller size of Meta's new Superintelligence Labs team. It's an echo of what he's said about building lean teams focused on efficiency. He praises "the ability for small talent, dense teams to be the optimal configuration for driving frontier research." It breaks from how the company operates in other divisions, he notes. "If you look at like what we do in Instagram or Facebook or our ad system, we can very productively have many hundreds or 1000s of people basically working on improving those systems," he says. "But I think for this, for the leading research on superintelligence, you really want the smallest group that can hold the whole thing in their head." Zuckerberg says he doesn't believe his thinking on open-source has particularly changed. Zuckerberg expects to continue to ship open-source products, though there are some challenging considerations with open-sourcing at this scale, he says. "We're getting models that are so big that they're just not practical for a lot of other people to use. So we kind of wrestle with whether it's productive or helpful to share that, or if that's really just primarily helping competitors or something like that," he says. The bottom line, Zuckerberg says, is he expects to continue to ship open-source products, but not every product will be — which he says is a continuation of Meta's approach to open-source. "There's just a very high chance it seems like the world is going to look pretty different in a few years from now," Zuckerberg notes. "The more aggressive assumptions, or the fastest assumptions, have been the ones that have most accurately predicted what would happen." The stock price hits $771 as questions with Wall Street analysts begin. Li says the company continues to focus on head count growth in its "highest priority areas." "We've had a particular emphasis on recruiting leading talent within the industry as we build out Meta Superintelligence Labs to accelerate our AI model development and product initiatives," she says. Turning to AI-related infrastructure costs, Meta also expects to "ramp our investments significantly in 2026" for infrastructure. "Nearly 2 million advertisers are now using our video generation features, image animation, and video expansion, and we're seeing strong results with our text generation tools as we continue to add new features," CFO Susan Li says. In the second quarter, the company started testing AI-powered translations to 10 different languages, she adds. Meta says Reality Labs revenue, its segment that includes its AI hardware as well as virtual and augmented reality headsets, is up nearly 5% — thanks to sales of its AI Ray-Bans. Zuckerberg says that he thinks AI glasses will be "the main way" that the company integrates personal superintelligence into people's daily lives. The Meta CEO says the company has built an "elite" team of AI researchers and engineers, highlighting the hire of Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang, who leads the new lab. "We're building an elite, talent-dense team," he said. "I've spent a lot of time building this team this quarter." He also referenced the hiring of ex-OpenAI researcher Shengjia Zhao, chief scientist of Meta's Superintelligence Labs and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. The company has noted in its earnings release that employee compensation for adding technical talent in "priority areas" (read AI) is its second-greatest driver of cost growth. CEO Mark Zuckerberg is on the call, along with CFO Susan Li. "Meta's blowout earnings and raised guidance highlight how AI is becoming a real revenue driver, not just hype," said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com. "From ad targeting to content discovery, Meta is showing how to deploy AI at scale — and Wall Street is rewarding it. The company's continued heavy investment in AI infrastructure signals it's playing the long game and betting big on foundational models and compute power." Minda Smiley, senior analyst at EMARKETER, a sister company of Business Insider, said the company's strong quarter shows it "not only weathered but perhaps even benefitted from economic instability in recent months" and that the digital ads market more broadly "might not yet feel the pain from tariffs, though that could change." And while Meta continues pouring money into its AI ambitions, "Meta's exorbitant spending on its AI visions will continue to draw questions and scrutiny from investors who are eager to see returns," Smiley said. The company revised its ranges on total expenses and capital expenditures it forecasts for 2025, narrowing its estimates. Its total expense outlook, previously $113 to $118 billion, is now $114 to $118 billion for the year. (That's growth of 20 to 24% year-over-year.) Meta also narrowed its capex range, from $64 to $72 billion previously to $66 to $72 billion for the year. It says it also expects "another year of similarly significant capital expenditures dollar growth in 2026." Those AI talent wars you've been reading about? They're real — and expensive — Meta says. Not in those words, exactly. But that's clearly what the company is getting at in today's note to investors, where it acknowledged that all that spending is indeed going to show up on its financial statements. "While we are still very early in planning for next year, there are a few factors we expect will provide meaningful upward pressure on our 2026 total expense growth rate," Meta said. "The largest single driver of growth will be infrastructure costs, driven by a sharp acceleration in depreciation expense growth and higher operating costs as we continue to scale up our infrastructure fleet." "Aside from infrastructure, we expect the second largest driver of growth to be employee compensation as we add technical talent in priority areas," Meta added. That said, Meta says its overall organization got smaller in the last quarter. It currently employs 75,945 people, down about 1% from the 76,834 it reported in Q1. —Peter Kafka Second quarter Advertising rev. $46.56 billion, +21% y/y, estimate $44.07 billion Family of Apps revenue $47.15 billion, +22% y/y, estimate $44.4 billion Reality Labs revenue $370 million, +4.8% y/y, estimate $386 million Other revenue $583 million, +50% y/y, estimate $500.6 million Operating income $20.44 billion, +38% y/y, estimate $17.24 billion Family of Apps operating income $24.97 billion, +29% y/y, estimate $22.16 billion Reality Labs operating loss $4.53 billion, +0.9% y/y, estimate loss $4.86 billion Average price per ad +9% vs. +10% y/y, estimate +7.58% Source: Bloomberg data Meta's hardware sales could be key to watch in light of some new developments since the company's last earnings call. In June, Zuckerberg unveiled new Oakley Meta glasses, similar to Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses but branded as "performance AI glasses" geared toward athletes. Earlier this week, EssilorLuxottica, which makes Ray-Ban and Oakley, said revenue from sales of Meta's Ray-Bans more than tripled year-over-year. Wall Street was impressed with Meta's demo of its Orion augmented reality glasses prototype in September, though the glasses aren't expected to launch to consumers before 2027. Any update on the expected timeline for the more advanced AI smart glasses, which included integrated displays in the lenses, would be of interest to investors. Meta stock edged 0.6% lower Wednesday afternoon as investors prepared to parse the company's quarterly results. Shares of the tech giant are up 19% year-to-date. You can expect AI to be a heavy focus on this earnings call. (What else is new?) The company is allocating billions in capital expenditures toward infrastructure, talent, and other costs to support its AI ambitions. Meta has been in an all-out talent war for the biggest names in AI, poaching some competitors from rival firms with million-dollar bonuses. The company in June announced a new AI division called Superintelligence Labs. The company took a 49% stake in Scale AI for nearly $15 billion to make Scale founder Alexandr Wang Meta's new chief AI officer. — Sarah Jackson Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research, wrote this month that investors will likely be most interested in three things heading into Meta's earnings call: Still, Zino said he expects Meta to meet its expected revenue targets for the second and third quarters, largely due to increased stability in the digital ad market. CFRA reiterated its "Buy" rating on the stock and lifted its price target to $800 from $750, implying 12% upside from current levels. Zuckerberg kicked off the company's earnings day by sharing his vision on superintelligence, which he believes is "now in sight." His memo Wednesday outlined his hope for a future where everyone has "a personal superintelligence that helps you achieve your goals." "Personal superintelligence that knows us deeply, understands our goals, and can help us achieve them will be by far the most useful," he wrote. "Personal devices like glasses that understand our context because they can see what we see, hear what we hear, and interact with us throughout the day will become our primary computing devices." (Of course, it's worth noting that Meta sells various smart glasses.) — Sarah Jackson Meta could lift its capital expenditures even higher as it ploughs more money into AI and superintelligence projects, analysts at Citizens wrote. "With Meta making material investments in its superintelligence team, including researchers and compute, we believe the company is going through a significant investment cycle and we expect 2026 CapEx to surprise the Street as Meta builds multiple 1GQ or greater data centers," they said, estimating capex could come in around $91 billion next year. Stocks typically don't benefit when a company is going through an investment cycle, analysts said, but the situation could be different for Meta, as AI can enhance the ad experience for users. The firm reiterated its "Market Outperform" rating and $750 price target on the stock, implying 5% upside from current levels. Needham had a mixed view of Meta headed into its second-quarter earnings. On the one hand, the firm's analysts upgraded their rating for the stock from "Underperform" to "Hold," citing two positive catalysts: Still, the firm sees a few risks ahead that held it back from rating the stock a "buy." Those include pressure on Meta's margins and free-cash flow, potentially higher-than-expected total labor costs due to stock-based compensation, and Meta's use of several strategies in its business, which "wastes capital and adds risks," analysts said. Oppenheimer said it sees a handful of risks looming for Meta stock. Oppenheimer reiterated its "Outperform" rating on the stock and lifted its price target to $775 a share, implying 9% upside from current levels. Bank of America called Meta a "Top Online ad stock" for 2025 in a note this month. That's because the company looks best-positioned to reap the benefits from AI-driven advertising, analysts wrote, which they believe could support a higher valuation for the stock. In a separate note, analysts said they expected Meta to beat consensus estimates for second-quarter earnings, pointing to positive checks the bank conducted on Meta's advertising business. Revenue could come in around $45.5 billion, they estimated, at the higher end of Meta's guidance for the quarter. The bank reiterated its "Buy" rating on Meta. Earlier this month, it lifted its price target for the stock to $775 from $765, which implies 9% upside from current levels. Second Quarter Third Quarter Full year Source: Bloomberg data Jump to

Title: 6 Top Nuclear Power Stocks And ETFs To Buy And Power Your Portfolio Growth

Time Published: 2025-07-29T14:37:12Z

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. As power hungry AI cloud services providers seek ever more energy, nuclear energy is enjoying a revival. While younger people who did not live through the near-meltdowns such as Chernobyl (1986) and Three Mile Island (1979) are bullish, the regulatory and financial barriers to building nuclear power plants remain formidable. Nevertheless, capital providers see these barriers as worth hurdling. With annual investment in nuclear power doubling to $60 billion since 2020, nuclear power could energize your portfolio. For example, Microsoft signed a 20-year agreement to use power from Three Mile Island, and Meta signed a similar deal with another nuclear power facility. To profit from this trend while considering the risks, read on for three publicly-traded stocks and three exchange traded funds which could rise along with demand for nuclear energy. With concerns about energy security and climate change on the rise, nuclear power is experiencing a resurgence. Roughly 400 reactors are now operating in 31 countries providing about 5% of the world’s electricity. What’s more, new nuclear reactors are being constructed. Of the 63 nuclear reactors being built, many deploy new technologies such as Small Modular Reactors – which are safer and smaller – and advanced Generation IV reactors, wrote Goldman Sachs. Another positive is the support for nuclear power from younger people who lack a direct memory of previous disasters and recognize nuclear’s “role in decarbonization efforts,” reports Strats Research. Nevertheless, nuclear faces significant challenges, including the following: Baltimore, Maryland-based Constellation Energy Corporation produces and sells electricity, natural gas, energy-related products and sustainable solutions in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New York, ERCOT and other power regions. Constellation is a top choice because it is the largest operator of nuclear reactors in the United States and a major provider of carbon-free electricity. The company's focus on nuclear power provides a reliable source of baseload electricity and makes it an attractive partner for technology companies needing consistent power for data centers. For instance, Meta recently announced a 20-year nuclear agreement with Constellation. Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based Cameco Corporation provides uranium through three segments: Uranium, Fuel Services and Westinghouse. The Uranium segment explores for, mines, mills, purchases and sells uranium concentrate. The Fuel Services segment refines, converts, and fabricates uranium concentrate. The Westinghouse segment makes nuclear reactor technology equipment and provides products and services to commercial utilities and government agencies, reported Yahoo! Finance. As one of the world's largest uranium producers, Cameco is a top choice because it is likely to benefit from increasing nuclear fuel demand. The company has substantial high-grade uranium reserves and long-term contracts with utility companies, providing a degree of stability. Cameco also has an ownership stake in Westinghouse Electric, providing exposure to nuclear reactor construction, according to SeekingAlpha. Corvallis, Oregon-based NuScale Power provides a small modular reactor technology system -- the NuScale Power Module. The NPM, a water reactor, can generate 77 megawatts of electricity. Founded in 2007, NuScale operates as a subsidiary of Fluor Enterprises, according to Yahoo! Finance. NuScale is a top choice due to the company’s leadership in SMR technology, which offers potential benefits in scalability, safety, and faster deployment compared to traditional large reactors. The company’s SMR design is the first to be certified by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, giving it a potential first-mover advantage in this emerging technology, according to 24/7 Wall Street. One year price change: 48.7% Top five holdings: The VanEck Uranium and Nuclear ETF The fund normally invests at least 80% of its total assets in securities that comprise the fund's benchmark index of equity securities and depositary receipts issued by uranium and nuclear energy companies, according to Yahoo! Finance. The ETF is a top choice because it offers broader exposure to the nuclear energy sector beyond just uranium miners. It includes uranium miners, nuclear power plant builders and maintainers, nuclear electricity producers, and related equipment and technology. The fund's exposure to utilities can make a portfolio more defensive. One year price change: 50% Top five holdings: Range Nuclear Renaissance Index ETF normally invests in securities of nuclear fuel and energy – particularly in the areas of advanced reactors; utilities; construction and services; and/or fuel. Under normal circumstances, the fund invests at least 80% of its net assets in securities of nuclear companies. The ETF is a top choice because it tracks a custom index reflecting the nuclear industry broadly. It offers significant exposure to advanced reactor technology, including a large position in Oklo, which makes small modular reactors. NUKZ has shown strong performance and offers exposure to the developing advanced nuclear technology sector, according to TipRanks. One year price change: 54.6% Top five holdings: Global X Uranium ETF normally invests at least 80% of its total assets in the securities of the underlying index that tracks the broad based equity market performance of global companies involved in the uranium industry, according to Yahoo! Finance. URA is a top choice because it is the largest and most popular nuclear ETF by assets under management. It provides broad exposure to the uranium and nuclear energy value chain, including uranium producers, nuclear component manufacturers and service providers. This ETF also offers direct exposure to the physical uranium commodity, which is unique among nuclear ETFs. Bottom Line With investment in nuclear power doubling over the last five years, should you invest in companies and ETFs that track its growth? Despite the risks of nuclear power – which include enormous capital requirements, regulatory and political hurdles and the risk of nuclear accidents – the stocks and ETFs highlighted above may offer upside opportunity. As long as large AI cloud services providers are eager to buy nuclear energy, these investments could enrich your portfolio

Title: Ethereum: BitMine’s Bold $60K ETH Call Fails To Offset Stock Slide

Ethereum is on the spotlight as BitMine Immersion Technologies stock took a sharp hit on Monday, falling over 25% despite a fresh round of bullish messaging from Tom Lee of FundStrat. Investors seemed unconvinced by the plan to make BitMine a major holder and staker of Ethereum. The dip came after shares slid over 10% during regular hours to $35, then dropped another 15% in after‑hours trading. According to FundStrat’s Tom Lee, BitMine plans to hold 5% of Ethereum’s total supply and become a “made in America validator network.” He highlighted that BitMine already has 600,000 ETH on its balance sheet—worth more than $2 billion at current prices. Lee even floated the idea that Ether could reach an implied valuation of $60,000, citing unnamed research firms. But those bold figures failed to calm the market. 10/18 We asked several research firms to give us “replacement” value (of Wall Street) to value ETH – this is for illustrative purposes only – implied value for ETH is $60,000 – ETH currently ~$3,800 pic.twitter.com/mXa5uCZukv — Bitmine BMNR (@BitMNR) July 28, 2025 Analysts had pointed out that BitMine’s stock had wildly surged earlier this month. The price shot up more than 3,000% to a yearly high of $135 on July 3 after the initial announcement of the Ether‑buying strategy. That rally was met with a wave of profit‑taking once the plan was fully laid out. Many traders sold into the strength, and the mood shifted quickly when shareholders saw the fine print. Based on reports from Kronos Research, treasury rollouts on this scale require a solid plan to protect capital and maintain liquidity. Vincent Liu, Kronos’s chief investment officer, warned that without clear steps for custody and staking infrastructure, holding large amounts of Ether could create big swings in value. And those swings spooked some investors when Lee’s “Chairman’s Message” failed to pin down exact timelines or reveal audit partners. On top of that, the implied $60,000 target for Ether came from sources that remain unnamed. That lack of transparency set off alarm bells. Investors want to know who did the math and whether the data holds up under scrutiny. When price targets are presented without clear attribution, doubt grows fast. Meanwhile, other firms are also loading up on Ether. SharpLink Gaming controls 438,000 ETH. Bit Digital holds over 100,000 ETH. Blockchain Technology Consensus Solutions recently boosted its stake to 29,122 ETH after raising $62 million. Finality Capital’s partner David Grider compared the trend to Strategy’s big bet on Bitcoin—saying these moves should help ETH flows and price action. Finality Capital, he disclosed, holds a position in BitMine itself. Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Meta Stock Price Levels to Watch Ahead of Facebook Parent's Earnings Report

Shares in Meta Platforms (META) rose to start the week ahead of the tech giant’s highly anticipated quarterly earnings report, due after Wednesday’s close. Investors will pay close attention to the company’s AI infrastructure spending plans after its Magnificent Seven rival, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), last week raised its 2025 capital expenditures projection by $10 billion to $85 billion. Meta has said it expects to spend $64 billion to $72 billion in capex this year, a figure Wells Fargo analysts expect to reach $76.7 billion in 2026. The stock gained 0.7% on Monday to finish the session near $718. Meta shares have risen 23% since the start of the year as of Monday’s close, boosted by the company’s ongoing efforts to fortify its AI position among its big tech peers. Below, we take a closer look at Meta’s chart and use technical analysis to identify key price levels worth watching out for. After hitting an all-time high last month, Meta shares have undergone a pullback toward the respected 50-day moving average (MA) ahead of the tech giant’s quarterly results. However, the relative strength index sits above neutral territory, indicating price momentum remains positive. It’s worth pointing out that trading volume in the stock has remained subdued in recent months, suggesting that larger market participants are waiting for the company’s report before deploying further capital. Let’s identify two key overhead areas to watch on Meta’s chart and also locate support levels worth monitoring during potential retracements. The first overhead area to watch sits around $740. The shares could face significant overhead selling pressure in this location near price action situated just below the stock’s prominent February and June peaks. If the stock moves into price discovery above last month’s record high, investors can forecast a target using bars pattern analysis, a chart technique that analyzes prior trends to project future directional movements. When applying the technique to Meta’s chart, we take the stock’s trend higher from November to February and reposition it from this month’s low. The analysis forecasts a bullish target of around $930, implying 30% upside from Monday’s closing price. We selected this earlier move as it commenced following a retracement to the 50-day MA, providing clues as to how a similar uptrend from the indicator may take shape. During retracements in the stock, it’s initially worth watching the $680 level. This area could provide support near a range of corresponding trading activity that formed on the chart between February and June. Finally, a deeper pullback could see Meta shares revisit lower support around $635, currently just above the upward sloping 200-day MA. Investors may look for entry points in this location near a series of peaks and troughs on the chart from December to May.

Title: Up 80% This Year What's Next For Celestica Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/07/29/up-80-this-year-whats-next-for-celestica-stock/
Time Published: 2025-07-29T09:30:29Z

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Celestica (NYSE:CLS) has recently been experiencing significant growth — the stock has risen 80% year-to-date and has more than tripled in value over the past year. What factors are contributing to this increase? The company, recognized for its electronics manufacturing and supply chain services, is benefiting from a surge in demand for AI-powered networking equipment and cloud infrastructure, driven by major technology companies. This upswing is spurring rapid expansion in its Connectivity & Cloud Solutions (CCS) division — a segment that encompasses everything from servers and storage to high-performance networking hardware. In Q1 2025, CCS revenue reached $1.84 billion, an increase of 28% compared to the previous year. The key AI-related offerings within this segment include servers, integrated rack solutions, and high-performance networking switches, all of which are essential for modern AI workloads. The extensive AI boom is projected to maintain demand. Major technology firms are currently engaged in unprecedented cycles of infrastructure investment. Amazon is anticipated to allocate as much as $105 billion for capital expenditures in 2025. Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta are estimated to invest $80 billion, $75 billion, and $72 billion, respectively — much of this directed towards AI infrastructure. This trend should bolster demand for Celestica. How does the stock’s fundamental outlook appear, and will its momentum continue? The stock appears relatively expensive — making it a costly choice to purchase at its current price of around $170. We identify some minor concerns regarding CLS stock. Our conclusion is derived by comparing the current valuation of CLS stock with its operational performance in recent years, in addition to its current and historical financial status. Our assessment of Celestica along crucial metrics of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience indicates that the company possesses a strong operational performance and financial health, as outlined below. However, if you are looking for potential gains with reduced volatility compared to individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative — having outperformed the S&P 500 and yielded returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Also see: QuantumScape: QS Stock To $0? Celestica’s valuation seems high when assessed against the wider market. While its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 2.0 is less than the S&P 500’s 3.1, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 47.8 is considerably higher than the benchmark’s 22.8. Nevertheless, this is supported by the company's robust recent top-line growth. Revenues have risen at an average annual rate of 19.3% over the past three years, significantly surpassing the S&P 500’s 5.3%. Over the last year, Celestica’s Revenues increased by 21% to reach $10 billion, while the S&P 500 only managed a modest growth of 4.4%. However, its profitability remains behind. The net income margin over the past year was only 4.1% (compared to 11.9% for the S&P 500). Nonetheless, operating performance is showing positive trends, with Celestica achieving a record adjusted operating margin of 7.1% in the latest quarter, up from 5.9% in Q1 2024. This upward margin trend and strong revenue should, in time, lead to higher earnings, potentially justifying the company's elevated valuation. From a financial health perspective, Celestica appears robust, with a low debt-to-equity ratio of 4.8%, comfortably below the S&P 500 average of 22.6%. The company maintains a moderate cash reserve that constitutes 5.2% of its total assets. However, CLS stock has historically demonstrated sensitivity to market downturns. For example, during the Covid-19 market crash, CLS plummeted 69% compared to a 33.9% drop in the S&P 500. Likewise, in 2022, amid inflation-related shocks, the stock fell 35.6% during a broader market correction, exceeding the S&P’s 25.4% decline. Additional risks also exist. The company has a significant manufacturing presence in Asia (approximately two-thirds of production), and tariffs imposed by the U.S. government may elevate supply chain costs and exert pressure on profit margins. The high valuation of CLS stock may restrict its upside potential in the near to mid-term. As an alternative, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices), has produced strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided an effective strategy to capitalize on favorable market conditions while mitigating losses during market downturns, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.
