Last October, on a Martin Luther–inspired website called www.18theses.com, a software executive named Shyam Sankar published a four-thousand-word polemic with the title “The Defense Reformation.” “As a nation, we are in an undeclared state of emergency,” it begins. There follows a litany of provocations: Chinese escalation in the South China Sea, Iranian attacks on US military bases, the October 7 attacks in Israel, “an estimated 1 million casualties in brutal combat in Ukraine.” All this, Sankar writes, amounts to “a hot Cold War II.” It is a war, he argues, for which the US is catastrophically underprepared: “In the current environment, American industries can’t produce a minimum line of ships, subs, munitions, aircraft, and more.” The problem lies with American capitalism in its present form, which—as Sankar lamented last year on a military podcast called The Merge—has left legacy defense firms like Lockheed Martin dominated by “fifth-generation MBA cadre[s]” who care more “about cash flow and buybacks and dividends than…about the honest hard work of engineering innovation.” Under these conditions the defense department’s subsidies for private business, he writes in “The Defense Reformation,” have neither “the supposed advantages of a planned economy nor the (far superior) advantages of a free market.” Sankar is the CTO and executive vice-president of Palantir, the start-up cofounded in 2003 by Peter Thiel that specializes in a peculiar hybrid of big-data manipulation and McKinsey-style consulting work. Many of Sankar’s Palantir colleagues and peers at other Thielworld start-ups—notably Anduril, which bills itself as a pioneering disruptor in software-heavy military hardware—have advanced a similar criticism of the neoliberal state, bemoaning its declining interventions in manufacturing and research and lambasting the legacy defense firms, often nicknamed “primes,” for their sclerosis, inefficiency, and alleged monopolistic behavior. The innovative, capitalist spirit and manly vitalism that defined the defense department through the cold war is, for this group, long gone. The task of the hour, as Sankar writes in “The Defense Reformation,” is therefore nothing less than “to resurrect the American Industrial Base.” You might think this would mean something like what, under the previous administration, went by the name Bidenomics: initiatives such as the CHIPS Act or the Inflation Reduction Act, which paled in comparison to total federal defense spending—the combined estimated cost of those two bills, which would be spread over a number of years, was about half the annual defense bill—but nonetheless aimed to bring high-tech manufacturing back to US shores. You would be wrong. “The most important and malleable weapons system,” Sankar writes, is not missiles or other military hardware but software, by which he presumably means technologies like large-scale data manipulation, narrow forms of computerized optimization applied to “smart” weapons systems and robotics, sensors, autonomous weapons systems, and artificial intelligence. Investing lavishly in such technology and teaching “our warriors…to wield the software industrial base to maximize lethality” will catalyze what Sankar has elsewhere called a “software-driven reindustrialization” akin to previous industrial revolutions based around water, steam, coal, or oil. For a range of figures in the emergent defense-tech sector to which Palantir and Anduril belong, this will require wrenching guaranteed contracts from the bloated primes and promoting competition by having branches of the armed services bid against one another, not to mention allowing even more sales elsewhere. It will also require binding the state closer to a range of tech giants—especially firms like Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft­—that have thus far, on this view, neglected their patriotic duty to engage in defense work and profited from feminized “ad-tech” instead. These arguments have found a broad and receptive audience. In recent years a range of politicians have aligned themselves with the priorities of defense-tech firms, especially as successive White Houses worry about a belligerent Russia, a rising China, and the vulnerabilities exposed by Covid-induced supply shocks—all of which have reenergized a longstanding criticism of Reagan-era political-economic shifts that hobbled productive industries. The Obama and Biden administrations both empowered tech companies at the expense of the primes; Biden, skeptical of free trade and hawkish on China, courted Silicon Valley firms that promised to bring back domestic manufacturing and reindustrialize the rust belt and former defense hubs. But in recent years talk about “software-driven reindustrialization” has become especially widespread on a faction of the new right. That the Trump adviser and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer could rail on X against Lockheed Martin, with its “woke agenda,” for “delivering F-35 fighter jets that are simply not ready for combat”—and that Elon Musk could respond to her that, in any case, “crewed aircraft will be destroyed instantly by cheap drone swarms”—owes much to the rhetoric of Sankar and his peers. This new Silicon Valley defense-tech and finance group—their grievances, ideology, and policy visions—has become central to Trump’s second term. Several defense-tech boosters have assumed powerful positions in the administration, most notably one of Anduril’s former senior directors, Michael Obadal, who was just confirmed as Army under secretary, the second-highest ranking civilian official in the Army. Since January Palantir and Anduril have received many billions in contracts, with more on the way. ICE has contracted Palantir since 2011 for software it uses to enforce sanctions and make arrests, and in April signed a new $30 million contract with the company to, in The New York Times’s words, “build a platform to track migrant movements in real time.” Presumably the deal will help ICE’s director, Todd Lyons, realize a vision he laid out that same month at the Border Security Expo in Phoenix, where he said that he wants his agency to run like Amazon Prime, “but with human beings.” Advertisement These trends show no signs of stopping. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed the Department of Defense—now calling itself the Department of War—to increase its spending on software, which, he stresses, is “at the core of every weapon and supporting system we field to remain the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world.” Trump has signed executive orders designed to ease restrictions on defense exports and speed up and reduce oversight of the DoD’s acquisition process. In September the army announced a new venture-capital-style model for procurement called “Fuze.” Firms like Palantir and their new constellation of Silicon Valley funders stand to benefit handsomely from these developments. “We’re moving to a software-driven, autonomous…battlefield,” the managing director for a prominent private equity firm said at a defense summit earlier this year. “Well, if you want daily software upgrades, you gotta pay software margins.” * Few would contest that the political economy of American defense is troubled. Defense monopolies have stifled competition; companies have slowed their investment in production and concentrated instead on payouts to themselves and shareholders; costs and schedules have spun out of control. By now, as the scholar William Hartung has written, the federal government’s ballooning defense budget goes increasingly to “costly, dysfunctional weapons systems that are ill-suited to addressing current challenges.” Yet venture-funded defense-tech firms like Palantir and Anduril have positioned themselves as the solution to these ills without any clear evidence that they can deliver on that promise. The problem, put simply, is that they don’t have expertise in building things. Because they are above all instruments of financialization, designed to bring future values into the present, they tend to be better at generating short-term profits and juicing shareholder value than at creating durable, high-performing software or hardware systems. Anduril and other companies that offer “autonomous,” AI-enhanced hardware, for instance, have by now attracted criticism from a range of commentators: the evidence indicates that, despite their claims to the contrary, Silicon Valley drones and counterdrones have underperformed in Ukraine, where fighters have tended to prefer cheaper, hardier Chinese and homegrown drones instead. Adopting Palantir’s signature data-organizing software, too, could have significant problems for companies and government agencies in the long term. The software’s code is closed-source and privately hosted by Palantir, which retains the power—subject to the terms of its contracts and to the extent they prove enforceable—to change, update, or terminate it. Using it as the “data backbone” for a vast and complicated system makes it distinctly costly and burdensome to switch software in the future, not to mention to train and retrain its users. Meanwhile, as several critics have argued, the user loses a significant measure of control over the system itself. “The single fundamental problem with the Palantir contract is that the government is outsourcing all of the work to one company in one go,” a data expert told the New Statesman earlier this year, “and what you get is vendor lock-in. The state doesn’t understand the work, they can’t see the work…. You develop no knowledge, no understanding of it.” On the podcast Second Breakfast, the lawyer and former Army officer Eric Robinson related that, when he used Palantir’s software in the 2010s, “they would recode your data ingest so you couldn’t export it again,” with the result that “you had to pay for their tech to effectively be part of your order of battle…. It often seems like a form of long-term rent seeking.” In the telling of companies like Palantir and Anduril, their innovation, efficiency, and software expertise qualify them to jump-start a new era of American industrial policy. But not only do they seem ill-suited for such a task, they have publicly backed the Trump administration as it destroys the foundations of what industrial policy the country has. Alex Karp, the CEO of Palantir, has, for instance, denounced “wokeness” for “corrupting and corroding our institutions,” echoing the rhetoric that Trump and other Republicans have used to attack measures like the CHIPS Act for including some redistributive initiatives and giving workers benefits like child care. We are now in a situation, in other words, where an array of right-wing firms and think tanks perversely extol the virtues of industrial policy and American renewal even as they support politicians and financial institutions that are currently dismantling the infrastructure to actually do industrial policy. Advertisement How did we get here? The answer lies, in part, in the fact that defense-related industries like the semiconductor sector have themselves long obscured their real relationship to industrial policy. It is a central tragedy of the long US century that military Keynesianism—the use of military spending to spur economic growth and enable spending on welfare and other public goods—has been the organizing principle for the country’s economy and social life since World War II. The defense budget—last year’s allocation was close to $900 billion—goes not just to weapons construction but also to a welfare state within a state: housing, health care, and social services. It funds a great deal of civilian industry, from wooden pallets to satellites and smartphones, not to mention research fundamental to the US economy and some degree of economic redistribution. Because of its sheer scale and reach, defense spending is unique in its ability to facilitate regional coalitions across party lines by directing funding to specific geographical targets: state-specific projects, bases, consortia, and so on. National Archives and Records Administration/Wikimedia Commons An armorer’s assistant installing a machine gun in a Lockheed P-38 plane at an aircraft plant in the Western US, circa November 1942 By forcing policymakers to appeal to “national security” (which since the 1980s has expanded to encompass “economic security”)1 to justify any efforts at industrial policy or social welfare, this system has long hobbled our ability to build a better world. But during the 1970s and 1980s, when a newly organized right wing took aim at state spending and capacity across the board, even the essential national-security fields of electronics and defense found their access to long-term government support under threat. To retain it, they arrived at a kind of truce. In public, these firms would happily chalk their success up to their own entrepreneurial genius. Under the radar, however, a range of policymakers and industry leaders worked to patch together a precarious, largely hidden system of government support that allowed the businesses—albeit in compromised form—to keep relying on federal planning, funding, and stewardship. Now the new Silicon Valley defense firms are taking advantage of this state of affairs to press their own interests. Rather than downplaying their reliance on the government in public while reaping the benefits of industrial policy in practice, though, they have done just the opposite, indulging in rhetoric about the return of the strong state and “reindustrialization” even as they help dismantle the state in the service of financial capital. Understanding the implications of this shift requires grasping the complexities of the relationship that tech and defense firms have long enjoyed with US state power. 2. In moments of “revolutionary crisis,” Karl Marx wrote, men “anxiously conjure up the spirits of the past to their service, borrowing from them names, battle slogans, and costumes in order to present this new scene in world history in time-honored disguise and borrowed language.” The defense-tech elite are no exception: they talk obsessively about the past, transmuting political-economic reality into a story of great-men-as-founders. Karp praises the Manhattan Project and welcomes comparisons to Oppenheimer. A Los Angeles Times piece from last year discovered that Palmer Luckey, the much-profiled founder of Anduril, has a preoccupation with purchasing cold war military relics: the red nuclear phone, “a couple of submarines,” at least one ICBM site. He hopes one day, the profile notes, to acquire “the entire US ground-based nuclear deterrent system…to turn it into a vast museum.” Their account of twentieth-century military-economic history is distinctly revisionist. In his appearance last year on The Merge, Sankar explained how to fix the defense-industrial base. “The reality is you focus on winning,” he said: I’m not a founder of Palantir, but I think about going back to that World War II–era period and the immediate cold war, it was founders. We think of it as Northrop Grumman and Martin Marietta, but it was Jack Northrop and Glenn Martin and Howard Hughes and Henry Kaiser, and even inside of government, the Kelly Johnsons, the John Boyds. These are uniquely hardheaded, creative, difficult people that are required to win. And I think every start-up understands that. That’s what a start-up looks like. The truth is dramatically different. The two world wars turned industrial power into US military dominance not because they empowered the genius of individuals but because they built a new and formidable state.2 Industrial and state capacity—not to mention the relationship between industry and government—were forever transformed. World War I inaugurated the use of cost-plus contracts, which stipulate that the government pay for all the costs of development and production plus a set profit. World War II offered the US a taste of a centralized planned economy: the war effort consumed 57 percent of the national income, and the government itself converted all the plants it needed to manufacture war material.3 In 1942, for instance, the War Production Board—which centralized control of investment and production—forced the whiskey industry to divert 60 percent of its production to industrial alcohol and modernized productive processes. It would not be an exaggeration to attribute the many new industries that emerged, modernized, or accelerated in the postwar years—aeronautics, vastly improved automobiles and motors, chemical and especially petrochemical firms, modern shipbuilding, electronics, atomic energy, logistics—to centralized government planning and funding. With government help, as Hartung notes in his study Prophets of War, the aviation industry’s production increased by 13,500 percent.4 New plants cropped up across the country, especially in the South and West, inaugurating the long-term industrialization of those regions. Cooperative large-scale applied research proliferated through the National Defense Research Committee, which commandeered both industry and academic resources and personnel. In his 1992 study of US industrial policy, the historian Otis Graham noted that the Defense Plant Corporation built “some 30 percent of the plant capacity on which American mobilization depended,” which was crucial to the postwar aircraft industry.5 Business leaders resisted their subjection to government administrators, and as soon as the war was over they sought to erase these years from public memory. But the fact remained that US defense contractors and technology firms owed their existence to extensive, heavy-handed government planning. * Government support, oversight, and coordination of important industries largely persisted throughout the cold war. In the immediate postwar period military contracts slowed, but the Korean War ensured another boom that lasted until the wind down of the Vietnam War two decades later. The Department of Defense “directed a large portion of the nation’s scientific and engineering resources throughout the postwar era,” Graham wrote, “frequently picking winning technologies and products by supplying the military’s clients—chiefly the weapons, aerospace, telecommunications, and data processing industries—with R&D support and purchasing of output.” The government covered nearly all basic research (which mostly occurs at government labs and universities), and much of the research and development conducted by private industry. Companies had plenty of money to invest and reinvest in production—and the DoD pressured them to do just that. Science History Institute An employee inspecting the control board for a solvent recovery system at the Hercules Powder Company plant in Hopewell, Virginia, 1940s As the scholar Christophe Lécuyer shows in his study Making Silicon Valley, all this investment made the US semiconductor industry possible.6 DoD contracts remade Fairchild, the industry’s pioneering firm, into a major company, and Fairchild in turn brought suppliers and equipment-makers to the Bay Area. The DoD not only funded the development of microelectronics but prioritized incorporating them into military systems; starting in 1963, Lécuyer notes, proposals had to include them for the projects to receive funding. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara’s initiatives before and especially during the Vietnam War transformed defense spending and the industrial policy associated with it. Much was made by General Westmoreland, starting in the late 1960s, of the promise that war would become an “electronic battlefield,” with armies taking advantage of all “the advanced technology of communications, sensors, fire direction, and the required automatic data processing” to control the fighting from afar.7 That this vision failed to materialize and cost the US dearly—in lives, reputation, and resources—doesn’t seem to have led anyone to rethink its premises. In the late 1960s disenchanted defense workers organized to shift industries such as chemicals and electronics away from war and toward the public good, or at least toward private consumption—an effort known as “civilianization.” At the same time, a civilian market for computer chips was exploding. Those initiatives, the planned Vietnam wind down, and détente with the USSR all helped shrink the federal government’s spending on defense in general and military R&D in particular. But it was a brief experiment that came with significant backlash, helping propel Reagan to the presidency and shaping his industrial policy. The federal share of research dollars remained high for much of the cold war, funding the development of lasers, nuclear energy, rockets, aerospace, computers, scientific instruments, data processing, and telecommunications while neglecting automobiles, steel, pharmaceuticals, and textiles—all of which moved offshore to a greater degree than they already had. 3. The first major political-economic changes after World War II came with the neoliberal turn of the 1980s and 1990s. During these years several crises descended upon a range of productive sectors that had historically relied on federal industrial policy. Internationally, Japan perfected production techniques in high-tech manufacturing—of cars, machine tools, memory chips, and other electronics—and quickly approached dominance in many areas considered central to “national security,” like semiconductors and supercomputing. American pundits at the time identified this trend as a direct threat to American-style capitalism and US power.8 The period’s neoliberal economic reforms—which reduced and limited the nature of government spending while demonizing the most basic forms of long-term planning—weakened productive industries still further, leaving manufacturers beholden to shareholder demands for ever more profits and vulnerable to new threats from financial institutions. These conditions posed a distinct threat to productive sectors like the semiconductor industry. And yet Intel, which by 1992 was leading the industry in cutting-edge chips, managed to thrive nonetheless. When reporters asked how they did it, the company’s executives pointed to what they called “Moore’s Law,” the idea, named after Intel cofounder Gordon Moore, that chips regularly became smaller and more powerful according to something like a natural principle. Moore’s Law became a fixture of the industry’s marketing presentations, press releases, and internal conferences.9 Over the years it helped convince defense leaders like Clinton’s secretary of defense, William Perry, and his protégée Ash Carter that technological solutions could eventually be found for their most pressing and difficult political problems. Moore’s Law remains an unquestioned assumption of scientific, military and national security state discourse and policy, undergirding the entire political-economic imagination of the post–cold war United States. Just as intellectuals started worrying that there might be fundamental limits to capitalist growth, it posited a horizon of infinite progress. The truth was more complicated. Intel, founded in 1968 by Moore and Robert Noyce, came to prominence by developing some of the first commercial metal-oxide semiconductor chips. Those semiconductors had immediate, tangible benefits, including low power consumption, high noise immunity, and cost efficiency. Working from that basis, the company did regularly improve its output with a kind of lawlike consistency in this era. But it wasn’t Moore’s Law that won the battle with the Japanese. Instead, Intel and others in the semiconductor industry built coalitions to carve out exceptions to many of the period’s neoliberal reforms, reaping the benefits of extraordinary state support. Among other things, the Reagan administration offered tax incentives to subsidize factory construction and investment in manufacturing, encouraged coordination and cartelization by offering antimonopoly relief and state planning, and used economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure to force concessions from Japan, such as giving foreign—which in effect meant US—chip manufacturers 20 percent of their market share and sharing significant manufacturing knowledge. Intel Free Press/Wikimedia Commons Andy Grove (left), the longtime head of Intel, sitting with the company’s founders, Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, 1978 Under Reagan it was an open secret that the government’s treatment of the semiconductor industry, among others, amounted to a form of industrial policy. These measures had the backing of a powerful—if peculiar—bipartisan coalition that was preoccupied with sustaining American hegemony: national security and foreign policy hawks, factions in the business world, and a group of tech-friendly liberals, like Massachusetts senator Paul Tsongas and Tennessee senator Al Gore, who became known as the “Atari Democrats.” They were reacting to a new right that objected to industrial policy as such, on the grounds that any government planning and economic intervention smacked of communism: in late 1980 the first installment of the Heritage Foundation’s Mandate for Leadership—like its successor, Project 2025—called for destroying large swaths of government by loosening regulations and oversight, centralizing power in the executive, demolishing state capacity, and eliminating or significantly cutting funding for many programs and agencies. The new right lacked the political leverage to end industrial policy entirely. But between 1980 and 1993 they succeeded at making it politically toxic, forcing the industry and its allies to adjust their tactics. Bill Clinton, an Atari Democrat, took office hoping to build the US’s own version of Japan’s powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry; however hostile he was to labor, he implemented significant industrial policy for semiconductors immediately after his election. After Newt Gingrich’s Contract for America coalition swept Congress in 1994, however, the administration’s room for maneuver narrowed. It was still able to ensure some level of subsidies and planning for semiconductor firms like Intel. But it came to rely heavily on foreign policy measures—like sanctions, trade deals, diplomatic pressure, and throwing around US power to shape new international economic organizations like the World Trade Organization—to open new markets and ensure other benefits for tech companies. By the end of Clinton’s second term, a kind of tacit settlement had locked into place. Even as they continued to depend on these various forms of state support, semiconductor companies, tech entrepreneurs who relied on ever-improving semiconductors, and politicians on both sides of the aisle would insist they owed their success to the information-tech revolution, with its promise of infinite growth and cheap consumer goods, all predicated on the work of individual entrepreneurial geniuses. This rift between rhetoric and reality has only grown since. Today’s executives hardly seem to understand the conditions of their own industries; it is as if, on some level, they believe the flattering public narrative their predecessors spun. During his interview on The Merge, Sankar remarked that he and his peers are “children…of a Noycean culture.” In a sense this is not untrue. Intel’s Noyce and Sankar both downplay their industry’s debt to industrial policy; Palantir, not unlike Intel before it, is in part in the business of selling what Wired recently called “a seamless, almost magical solution to complex problems.” But Sankar clearly meant the analogy in a different sense: to lay claim to Noyce’s record of success, to brandish his legacy of American entrepreneurial technological genius, and to insist that Silicon Valley firms’ track record of such triumphs should entitle them to remake government in their own image. * The defense industry faced the same pressures that nearly destroyed US semiconductor firms at the dawn of the post–cold war era. In his last year in office Jimmy Carter reversed the cuts that had depressed the industry for much of the 1970s, and in his first term Reagan initiated an enormous military buildup. All this, Graham writes, strengthened the military’s claim on “the nation’s scientific and engineering resources, and thus its influence on industrial structure.” But other developments spelled trouble. By the early 1980s financial regulations were being loosened, and corporations were under increasing pressure—legal, managerial, and structural—to secure shareholder profits in the short term at the expense of long-term health. A low-margin productive industry like defense was badly suited to the era. By the mid-1980s firms were focusing on increasing their financial performance by using stock buybacks and cost-reduction strategies like just-in-time inventory management—ordering only enough resources to cover immediate needs. All this compromised their ability to respond flexibly to crises and to make high-quality products. In 1985 the Reagan administration started reducing defense spending again and limited other avenues for profit. Facing increased political scrutiny, Reagan officials had recently made a big show of auditing firms for the appearance of wasteful spending, introducing policies that tightened defense profits and increased accounting paperwork. Many companies, like GE, curtailed their defense wings or left the sector entirely to boost their stock values for an increasingly defense-skeptical Wall Street. The 1980s also saw the rise of corporate raiders, later known as private equity firms, which would acquire a majority share of a company’s stock, take control of its operations, and then “restructure” it, which usually meant stripping it for parts and paying themselves astronomical sums of money. Between 1982 and 1990 such outfits nearly destroyed several defense firms, including Martin Marietta and Lockheed, and left them weakened with large debt-to-equity ratios. With loosened financial rules and low margins came consolidation: between 1985 and 1988 ten of the top sixty defense firms acquired or were acquired by others. Perhaps no person’s career tracks how the defense industry navigated these changes more clearly than that of Norm Augustine. Born in 1935, Augustine got his start in defense at the Douglas Aircraft Company in 1958. His first foray into government came in 1965 as one of McNamara’s young hires, brought in from the private sector to cut waste using “economic efficiency” measures like cost-benefit analysis. He then ping-ponged between the public and private defense sectors: after serving as the under secretary of the Army he joined Martin Marietta, then one of the country’s largest defense firms. Between 1980 and 1982, meanwhile, he chaired the Defense Science Board, authoring reports on threats to the defense industrial base and its dependence on the troubled semiconductor sector. Rising in the ranks of Martin Marietta over the 1980s, Augustine saw that defense was in turmoil; he later referred to the decade as the industry’s “dark ages.” Denver Post/Getty Images Martin Marietta CEO Thomas G. Pownall (center) and Norman Augustine (right) talking with a shareholder, 1983 The fall of the USSR and Clinton’s electoral victory brought a new existential threat. Federal defense funding plummeted: between 1989 and 1997 procurement declined by 60 percent. The result was something like the industry’s Great Depression; in 1995 Augustine told a House committee that an estimated three quarters of the sector, about 90,000 firms, had evaporated in the span of a decade. As defense programs became fewer and more expensive, the remaining firms started making riskier bids, overpromising on cost, time, and quality. In 1993 Clinton’s defense secretary, Les Aspin, invited the CEOs of major defense firms to the Pentagon for a dinner that would become known as the “last supper.” The then-deputy defense secretary, William Perry, showed them a slideshow of necessary defense capacity: “We expect defense companies to go out of business,” he told them. When we talked in a recent interview, Augustine told me he feared the administration would nationalize at least significant parts of the industry. They were faced with either entering new markets, consolidating, or downsizing. In the five years that followed, Augustine consolidated many firms under Lockheed Martin, itself the product of the merger of Lockeed and Martin Marietta, forming the country’s largest defense firm. In 1995 the new company went public, at which point it started prioritizing stock prices and other contemporary markers of financial health. It worked: in 1997 Augustine wrote that the company’s share price had nearly doubled in two years. And yet in the process Lockheed Martin closed a quarter of its plants and laid off 100,000 workers, vastly paring down management and labor in the name of efficiency. The benefits of all this cost-cutting rarely went to the government. Nor were many of the gains reinvested in production. Lockheed Martin had become good at getting contracts; Augustine wrote in the Harvard Business Review about harnessing the “natural competitive instincts in human beings.” But the products themselves suffered: they were more expensive, slower to deliver, and of lower quality. * The state’s priorities were also changing. The Gulf War seemed to vindicate Westmoreland’s Vietnam-era dreams of an “electronic battlefield.” William Perry, soon elevated to defense secretary, became a firm believer that the US was on the cusp of a “revolution in military affairs”—the idea, as the RAND analyst Paul K. Davis has summarized it, that “technological developments sometimes make possible a qualitative change in the nature of warfare.” That conviction moved him to prioritize funding, developing, and promoting “dual-use” technologies that could be applied to both commercial and military settings. He and Clinton built closer relationships with technology firms, offering them greater access to government and policymaking.10 In the late 1990s, as the researcher Barry D. Watts notes in a 2008 report, the Pentagon encouraged defense companies to “act more like commercial firms.” Augustine was well-positioned to adapt to these conditions. He had advocated for government support for the semiconductor industry during its crisis: asking “why DoD or the government should provide support for the semiconductor industry,” he testified to the Senate in 1987, “would be much like asking at the outset of World War II why we should buy ships and airplanes because it might help the shipbuilding and the aircraft industries.” From his perch on initiatives like the Defense Science Board, he not only observed but shaped how Intel and others had navigated the changing political-economic waters; now he hoped to replicate their accomplishments. Between 1993 and 1998, as Hartung has shown, Augustine lobbied intensely—and successfully—for immense government subsidies for defense in general and the new Lockheed Martin in particular. Those subsidies came in many forms, from aid for mergers—“closing plants, relocating equipment, paying severance to laid-off workers, and providing ‘golden parachutes’ to board members and executives,” as Hartung puts it—to antitrust exemptions and subsidies for arms exports (especially to new NATO countries). “To say that Augustine is wired into the Washington policy-making process is an understatement,” Hartung noted in 1996. “For most of his career, he has been one of a handful of people drawing up the blueprints for American defense policies and deciding where the wiring should be placed.” In the 1990s companies like Intel experimented with setting up their own venture capital arms, government-backed consortia, and new institutions whose purpose was to plan and shape the markets around them. Augustine followed their lead: he and other defense industry leaders managed to insulate themselves both from democratic accountability and from the vagaries of anti-statist politics by creating experimental public institutions. In 1998 George Tenet’s CIA enlisted Augustine to help found a nonprofit venture capital firm called In-Q-Tel that gives start-ups long-term guidance and directs them to lucrative, stable government contracts. Unlike traditional VCs, In-Q-Tel claims to focus more on technology and less on profits, though over the years it seems to have helped these new companies make money more than it has helped the government acquire important technology. It was In-Q-Tel that assured the success of, among others, Palantir, Anduril, and the drone company Skydio. Augustine, who turned ninety this July, hardly ever uses words like “industrial policy” or “neoliberalism,” but in practice he and his peers became influential critics of the neoliberal turn. He has argued that, in the financialized economy, “the tax structure discourages long-term investments” and lamented that shareholders hoping for short-range profit want Lockheed Martin not to “invest in research.” Elsewhere, he has called for renewed federal funding for public education and criticized US companies for moving “much of their manufacturing capability abroad.” In an influential 2005 report called Rising Above the Gathering Storm, he and his colleagues argued that “the prosperity the United States enjoys today is due in no small part to investments the nation has made in research and development at universities, corporations, and national laboratories over the last fifty years.” The “pressures” on that sector, they warned, “could seriously erode this past success.” In such moments, Augustine sounds uncannily both like architects of Bidenomics such as Jake Sullivan and Jennifer Harris and like right-wing tech-defense figures such as Sankar, who has similarly criticized “the financialization of the defense industrial base.” There is a certain irony here: by founding In-Q-Tel and seeding a bipartisan consensus around what plagued America’s political economy, Augustine—perhaps inadvertently—helped create the coalition now hoping to displace the company he has spent much of his life running. 4. Defense stocks tanked in 1998 and 1999, and credit agencies downgraded their debt to nearly “uninvestable” levels. As the industry consolidated, firms got even bigger, more complex, and, via joint contracts, increasingly linked to one another. By 2000 they were in a delicate position. With relatively low profits and cash flow but high debt-to-equity ratios, they increasingly focused less on investing in essential R&D than on trying to grow in the short term by competing recklessly for contracts. Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division A pilot operating the instrument panel of the Lockheed Martin C-130J-30 Hercules cargo plane during a demonstration flight for Pentagon personnel and press over Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, 1998 Then came the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which, as Hartung has shown in Prophets of War, inaugurated an industry-wide bonanza. Companies like Lockheed Martin entered new markets: “enhanced interrogation,” translation, dubiously legal surveillance. The Bush administration was full of defense monopoly affiliates, among them Secretary of the Air Force James Roche, a former vice president at Northrop Grumman; Secretary of the Navy Gordon England, a former executive at General Dynamics; and Edward Aldridge, who was a member of Lockheed Martin’s board of directors while serving on the president’s commission on space. Congress subsidized Lockheed Martin for arming new Eastern European NATO members; in 2008 US companies accounted for two thirds of the world’s new arms sales. At the same time, the DoD came to focus on counterinsurgency and counterterrorism techniques that relied heavily on information technology, like cyberwar and “network-centric warfare.” Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld wanted to make “the leap into the information age” by pursuing drones and surveillance. None of this meant that the trend toward military privatization slowed. It continued apace through the Iraq War, from the US military’s contracts with mercenaries like Blackwater to private contracts for hardware. On Second Breakfast, the former Green Beret Justin McIntosh describes how outsourcing military functions to contractors during the Syrian conflict forced him into a situation not unlike The Wages of Fear: I had a truck that had a bent rod. These trucks that we’re driving around in, these MRAPs and these large RG-33s…[require] a contractor [to] come in and work on it. We were in an area where we had been shot at. I had to medically evacuate some guys. The contractors did not want to travel. They wanted me to drive this truck hundreds of kilometers to the safe base where they could then repair it. The problem, McIntosh continued, was that “we had already taken all of that capability that existed within the United States military”—for instance, the ability to repair its own equipment—and “shifted it over to the private sector. It gave them control.” * This tendency toward privatization continued through the Obama administration, during which defense officials started to fixate on reducing costs. (“The gusher has been turned off,” Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced in 2010.) Obama saw bloated defense monopolies as an obstacle to this goal. But rather than addressing the structure of the industry or its political economy, the administration focused on improving its topline numbers by switching out the supposedly corrupt, atrophied defense giants for new firms from the Democrat-friendly tech sector, which promised to replace the functions of the legacy firms more cheaply. An influential proponent of this turn was Ash Carter, whom Obama nominated as his defense secretary in 2014. Carter and his deputy, Robert Work, had a “simple but ambitious” agenda, as the anthropologist Roberto González has written: “to harness the best and brightest ideas from the tech industry for Pentagon use.”11 Carter’s emphasis would be not on training soldiers but on developing drones, automation, satellites, and other cutting-edge defense technologies sourced from Silicon Valley. Carter’s focus on unmanned tech was not exactly a break from the Bush era, but the shift to the Valley was. Fueled by experiments like In-Q-Tel, the tech-defense coalition was already looking to gain market share: in 2014, nearly a year before Carter took office, SpaceX sued the Air Force for preferring the primes; in 2016 Palantir filed a lawsuit against the Army for allegedly trying to develop internal intelligence software without adequately considering commercial options. (One of Anduril’s founders, Trae Stephens, has claimed that these lawsuits helped Anduril win defense department contracts.)12 Obama and then Trump both also expanded the department’s ability to use its “other transaction authority,” which allows the government to do business more easily with commercial entities, for example by letting it sign contracts faster and with less oversight. The defense start-ups that successfully attracted Silicon Valley financing relied on the extraordinary wealth and political lobbying connections of their founders. “Every defense company that had been founded by a billionaire was a success,” as Luckey—who sold his VR company, Oculus, to Facebook in 2014 for $2 billion—noted in 2024. “I hate that we live in a country where that’s the case,” he added. “But I realized that I had a unique responsibility as one of the very few people who was willing to work on national security and blessed with the resources to actually make a real go at it.” Obama officials proved receptive to such lobbying. During his tenure Carter set up an In-Q-Tel-inspired program called Defense Innovation Unit—Experimental (DIUx), which worked closely with a new Defense Innovation Board, chaired by the former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, to determine the government’s investments in emerging technology, from drones to AI. It encouraged Silicon Valley firms and funders with the promise of long-term contracts for defense tech, as well as evaluation and testing—in effect ensuring their success in advance. Carter also laid the foundations for projects that came to fruition under the first Trump administration: between 2017 and 2019 the Army, the Air Force, and the Navy all launched their own experimental institutions designed to set up tech start-ups with military contracts. Private equity and venture capital saw an opportunity to make nearly guaranteed profits off the government’s investments. Between 2021 and 2024, VCs poured $130 billion into defense. In their book Unit X (2024), two of DIUx’s early directors, Raj M. Shah and Christopher Kirchhoff, claim that by 2017 their work had excited “investors and entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley” about working with the Pentagon by lowering “barriers to entry.” (They decline to specify which ones.) When James Mattis visited DIUx under the first Trump administration, in 2017, Shah and Kirchhoff arranged for him to have dinner with the tech investor Sam Altman (then at Y-Combinator) and the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who insisted that the Valley was interested in the defense industry and implored him to support the project. Mattis was enticed by the work they were doing on drones—a later fixation of Andreessen’s. Employees at Google expressed discontent with the company’s defense contracts, organizing to block initiatives like Project Maven, a machine learning program for the Pentagon. The project was hardly promising: as Alexander Cockburn wrote last year in Harper’s, an Air Force testing unit found in 2011 that, “among numerous other deficiencies,” the drone-mounted cameras on which it relied “could not ‘readily find and identify targets,’ and its transmission rate was too slow.” But DoD funders were eager to collaborate with Silicon Valley all the same. (According to Cockburn, Amazon, Microsoft, and Palantir were among the subcontractors who joined the Maven project after Google declined to renew the contract in 2018.) Since then employers have used the threat of AI to shrink the pool of tech jobs, costing the workers leverage. By 2022 employee dissent had been largely squashed: Google and other major defense firms all but declared that they were happy to work with the military. Now executives at tech and tech-defense firms brag about joining the army reserves to help with the design and purchase of their products—an arrangement that seems rife with potential conflicts of interest. The Biden administration continued many of these Obama-Trump trends. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin appointed Apple’s Doug Beck to direct DIU—as it was by now simply called—and empowered him to report directly to Austin. Congress gave the program nearly $1 billion for the 2024 financial year, and Biden awarded important hardware contracts to Palantir and Anduril. SpaceX doubled its federal contracts at the beginning of the Biden administration; they had practically doubled again by the end. In late 2022 Austin established the Office of Strategic Capital (OSC) to push investment in defense-oriented small businesses and tech start-ups; under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, it will have $200 billion to spend, and likely more in the 2026 National Defense Authorization Act. Perhaps most visibly, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks enthusiastically embraced all things tech: at a 2024 event organized by Andreessen’s VC firm, she emphasized that “moving fast and breaking things is necessary to win wars.” Nonetheless DIU’s leaders and their Silicon Valley allies felt that the Biden Department of Defense wasn’t friendly enough. By 2023, Shah and Kirchhoff complain, it still awarded most of its contracts to the primes. “It seemed as if the whole Biden team had forgotten about DIU and Silicon Valley,” they write, “even as Ukraine was aggressively deploying DIU technologies on the battlefield.” Their vision for the department is blunt: “All the Pentagon needs to do is be a great customer. Buy products, and trust that good venture capitalists will pour money into the companies building those products.” * All this support for the tech-defense sector has so far had disappointing results. A congressionally mandated report produced this year by the Government Accountability Office suggests that there were no metrics by which DIU could measure its success at actually bringing new technology into the military. The Biden defense department’s embrace of tech yielded such fruits as the “Replicator Initiative,” which committed in August 2023 to delivering “multiple thousands” of new autonomous systems in eighteen to twenty-four months. Hartung told me that many industry experts found that timeline hard to believe: no program had ever delivered products that fast. The deadline the initiative set has now passed, and his skepticism seems warranted. The initial delivery was said to be in the hundreds, and The Wall Street Journal recently reported that some of the program’s systems “have been unreliable, or were so expensive or slow to be manufactured they couldn’t be bought in the quantity needed.”For many observers, the first real test of Silicon Valley defense tech is how US-made drone technology fares in Ukraine, a war often cited as a laboratory for unmanned warfare. In a speech this past August, published in the Free Press, Luckey described going to the front lines “just a few weeks” after the full-scale Russian invasion “to train Ukrainian soldiers on advanced military technology that I had developed.” He witnessed “remarkable” feats, he said: “with drones costing just a few thousand dollars each, a handful of Ukrainian pilots remotely carpeted airstrips with explosives thousands of miles into Russia.” (He seems to have been playing fast and loose with chronology: Ukrainian drones reached hundreds of miles into Russian territory that December; it would take them still longer to reach thousands.) Drone technology has indeed been crucial to the conflict, especially more recently, as troops have been harder to come by on both sides. But a range of commentators have cautioned against assuming it therefore represents “the future of war.” Prominent defense think tanks like RUSI have warned that “overreliance on uncrewed aerial systems” has created “significant problems” for Ukraine, in part because it “plays into Russia’s strengths” at short-range air defense and other antidrone capabilities. William LaPlante, Biden’s under secretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, has echoed this view. “Don’t tell me it’s got AI and quantum in it. I don’t care,” he said at a 2022 conference. “The tech bros aren’t helping us too much in Ukraine…. It’s hardcore production of really serious weaponry. That’s what matters.” (Many drone companies, moreover, still rely on Chinese parts.) The subtext behind the flurry of puff pieces treating drone war as an inevitability is that a trough of money in the small-to-midsize drone market is up for grabs, over which various coalitions are starting to compete. Sean Gallup/Getty Images A soldier in a US Army platoon specializing in unmanned aircraft systems watches an Anduril Ghost-X drone landing during an exercise at the Hohenfels Training Area, Bavaria, February 3, 2025 To the extent that drones have proven essential in Ukraine, for that matter, hardware made in the US—by firms like Microsoft, Skydio, AeroVironment, and Cyberlux—has fallen short of expectations. Ukrainians have found US-produced drones “fragile and unable to overcome Russian jamming and GPS blackout technology,” The Wall Street Journal reported last year. “At times, they couldn’t take off, complete missions or return home.” Skydio recently announced that one of its controllers was vulnerable to radio interference. The trend of connecting more devices together to create an “Internet of things” often creates new vulnerabilities in turn. Anduril’s output is no exception. The defense blogger who writes under the name Secretary of Defense Rock observed in one widely shared piece that the company’s products “often amount to little more than rebranding existing technologies with a Silicon Valley gloss.” One of their much-touted anti-drone interceptors, the essay suggests, has “the same core function” as a familiar Raytheon product, “with marginal enhancements, repackaged in a sleeker design and infused with branding language that flatters venture capital expectations more than it reflects operational novelty.” Anduril continues to contend both with high costs and with certain problems in the field: “During an exercise last year in the Pacific called Project Kahuna,” according to the Journal, “drones from different manufacturers connected by Anduril’s software struggled at times to coordinate and perform tasks when out of sight from the operator.” Last month, Reuters has reported, the Army’s chief technology officer circulated a memo identifying a “very high risk” factor in Anduril’s prototype for a “next generation command and control” battlefield communications network: “We cannot control who sees what, we cannot see what users are doing, and we cannot verify that the software itself is secure.” None of this should be surprising. Anduril is making moves to scale up production, claiming that it plans to open a “hyperscale manufacturing facility” in Ohio next year—but VC–funded firms don’t usually have the incentives or structure to prioritize taking on high-risk hardware projects. Often such companies focus instead on acquiring other firms in areas they’d like to enter, whose “founders” and engineers tend to quickly depart. They often make cuts for “efficiency” that produce an attractive financial picture in the short term, but damage the company in the long run. “The primary product of the defense VC strategy,” the scholar Elke Schwarz has written in a recent article, “is not a defense technology as such, but financial returns achieved through growth.” Worse still, she notes, venture capital’s “mandate for hypergrowth” means that VC-funded companies feel even more pressure than regular ones to produce exponential profits; when those companies make defense products, investors stand to reap enormous windfalls if armed conflict escalates around the world. “To get the military-industrial sector to grow fast,” Schwarz writes, “perhaps the best catalyst is war, or at least the embrace of its possibility.” Indeed, in 2023 a representative of America’s Frontier Fund, a VC firm backed by Thiel and Schmidt, told investors that if “the China/Taiwan situation happens,” or more generally “if there is a kinetic event in the Pacific,” then the fund’s investments would go up ten times “overnight.” 5. Resisting the defense-tech sector’s great man theory of history has grown all the more urgent now, as the Trump administration seems intent on placing those “great men” at the helm of the national security state and entrusting them with reindustrializing the sectors attached to it. Michael Obadal, the former Anduril senior director who is now Army under secretary, is part of a large cohort of Silicon Valley–adjacent figures in the administration: Dan Driscoll, a onetime J.D. Vance adviser with a background in private equity and venture capital, was confirmed as Army secretary13; Steve Feinberg, founder of the notorious private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, which in recent years has invested heavily in defense tech, is in as deputy secretary at the Department of Defense, where he is using his experience to “restructure” the Pentagon; the retired general and venture capitalist Dan Kaine is now chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Office of Science and Technology Policy is now headed by Peter Thiel’s former chief of staff; and the assistant secretary of defense for critical technologies is now Michael Dodd, also known as “the Doddfather,” an alumnus of DIU. At least until the administration’s recent announcement that it is seeking an equity stake in Lockheed Martin, the primes appeared mostly sanguine about their aspiring competitors. Congress—which tech-defense firms spend millions lobbying14—writes the yearly defense budget, and primes have historically wielded considerable power there; they still receive the bulk of defense spending. Among the legacy firms the prevailing consensus has been that the upstarts will not be able to replace them: their products, after all, are already battle tested. Even so, the defense-tech contracts are pouring in. The Golden Dome missile defense program—a $175 billion-plus redux of Israel’s Iron Dome and Reagan’s Star Wars missile defense program, which experts call just as unfeasible as it was in the Eighties—seems to be shaping up as a cash giveaway to the tech-defense right; a joint bid from SpaceX, Anduril, and Palantir is reportedly the front-runner for the contract. (Hegseth has ordered major cuts at the Pentagon testing and evaluation office that a congressional panel recently tasked with assessing the program.) Other start-ups hope to privatize hardware testing, and Palantir seems to be positioning itself to assume some of the same functions of the embattled National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. New Pentagon rules that facilitate “anything-as-a-service” contracting allow private companies to shut off or modify their products as they desire (within contractual constraints, assuming these are followed), making US arms exports considerably less appealing to other countries but allowing the companies veto power over the use of their services or weapons—and further opportunities for rent-seeking. This past May, Luckey announced that Anduril would, as 60 Minutes put it, surpass “$6 billion in government contracts worldwide” by the end of the year. “We buy a lot of things from Palantir,” Trump said at a recent White House AI summit, calling out Sankar by name. Scott Legato for Palantir Technologies/Getty Images Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar giving a keynote speech at the Inaugural Reindustrialize Conference in front of a projection of Intel cofounder Robert Noyce, Detroit, Michigan, June 26, 2024 Defense-tech executives clearly hope to take advantage of the post-Covid surge of interest in industrial policy. There has been a great deal of chatter in right-wing circles, from Oren Cass’s American Compass to the Heritage Foundation, about the prospect that the US could move from a supposedly feminized service-based economy to a masculine-coded, producerist one organized around defense manufacturing. (In April, Fox News ran the chyron “TRUMP’S MANLY TARIFFS: PUNDIT BELIEVES IT COULD REVERSE CRISIS IN MASCULINITY.”) Even institutions like the American Enterprise Institute, which have historically reviled industrial policy in any form, have jumped on board, publishing papers endorsing industrial policies of different kinds tied to “national security.” Palantir’s leaders have echoed this rhetoric for their own purposes: Sankar lamented on The Merge that the best minds have gone into fields like ad-tech rather than defense engineering; Karp has declared that US industry has degenerated in the past fifty years to focus on “the consumer market” rather than using technology to “address challenges of industrial and national significance.” Trump himself seems to alternately contradict and endorse this agenda. He has been especially critical of CHIPS, accusing it of offering companies money they didn’t need and requiring them to hire “woke people” that hampered their success; at a recent AI summit he encouraged “all American companies to join us in rejecting poisonous Marxism in our technology.” It is as if he thinks that chip manufacturing can be brought back to the US through permitting reform and tariffs alone. Appalling immigration raids like the recent one on a Hyundai factory in Georgia have conflicted with the administration’s aim to learn from foreign expertise, producing extreme international backlash. Most recently, under Feinberg’s aegis at the DoD, the administration has pioneered an entirely new form of statecraft: running the Pentagon like a private equity firm. In the past two months the government has made a slew of one-off deals with companies like NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and a rare earth mineral company called MP Materials. At the center of some of these agreements is a novel reading of the Defense Production Act, which the Senate Armed Services Committee is trying to formalize via a new provision allowing the government to make equity purchases in private firms. The provision has yet to pass—which has not stopped the administration from going ahead anyway. The MP Materials agreement is instructive. Feinberg, no stranger to investing in the defense world, reportedly negotiated the deal, which includes a provision to buy magnets from the company despite the fact that they only started manufacturing magnets last year. By offering a price floor and production guarantees, the Department of Defense made it possible for Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan to finance the issuance of equity in the firm—at which point, seemingly for the first time in US history, the DoD itself bought enough equity to become the company’s largest single shareholder and provided a $150 million loan for the company’s California mine.15 Each of these deals works a bit differently. CHIPS had promised Intel $11 billion on the condition that it met certain milestones, including building an arguably unnecessary Ohio megafactory; when the firm appeared unlikely to meet those conditions, the Trump administration exchanged the remaining money for roughly 10 percent equity in the company. With AMD and NVIDIA, the mechanism looked more like a straightforward shakedown: Trump announced that if NVIDIA wants to continue selling AI chips to China, it has to fork over 15 percent of the profits. These moves hardly amount to a real industrial strategy. One-off coercive deals with individual companies already seem unlikely to reindustrialize the country, and it remains unclear what the administration will do with its new assets. But that outcome seems even less plausible as the Trump administration takes a sledgehammer to the government’s capacity, oversight, and industrial policy. In a mere nine months the administration has destroyed the infrastructure of research and development on which the semiconductor industry and many others rely; done its best to “get rid of” the “horrible, horrible” CHIPS Act, including the new research infrastructure it created; threatened to arbitrarily revoke awards and enacted swiftly changing tariffs that damage industries; behaved so erratically toward the US’s longtime allies that the EU and others have started looking elsewhere to buy weapons; erased the nonpartisan image on which the military depends for its continued funding and ability to operate; decimated the Pentagon’s civilian staff; devastated green industries while simultaneously promising to drive the price of oil so far down that the industry believes it will cause significant bankruptcies; and curtailed the Department of Defense’s product testing, among much else. None of the defense-tech firms that praise industrial policy in theory have launched any serious public protest against these decisions. The more contracts they get, meanwhile, the more government resources they will siphon away from investing in fields—like climate technologies, welfare, or alternatives to plastics—that would benefit the US’s economy or security. Bigger tech companies such as Meta, Amazon, and Google have, for their part, also moved much closer to the Trump administration. They seem indifferent about the destruction of the infrastructures of research and support upon which they previously relied, perhaps because they believe they can hire researchers on a mercenary basis, outsource research and development to AI, or replace government functions with private ones—a doubtful prospect, since the government’s function as a neutral evaluator and standard-setter seems impossible to replace.16 The practical problem with this vision, to say nothing of its moral and ethical failings, is that it can only deal with the short term. “We love disruption,” Karp said during the company’s quarterly earnings call in February. “Disruption, at the end of the day, exposes things that aren’t working. There will be ups and downs. There’s a revolution. Some people are going to get their heads cut off. We’re expecting to see really unexpected things and to win.” Tech companies and venture-capital firms have become experts at leveraging this sort of “disruption” to generate value for their shareholders on the basis of imagined future profits, and firms like Palantir and Anduril are no exception. But now they have become so voracious, so all-consuming, that they are putting the country’s productive industries at risk. In the process, they threaten to destroy not just the source of their own profits but the spending and investment that lie at the foundation of the US economy.

Title: As stock market booms, Americans have more at stake than ever

Small investors are riding a wave, even as Wall Street’s gains overlay a mixed economic picture and some analysts think the market is overheated. Americans have a greater share of their resources in the stock market than ever before, driving a historic accumulation of wealth that also leaves more individual investors exposed to the market’s ups and downs. That expansion comes as stocks march steadily upward in defiance of increasingly worrisome economic data. The S&P 500 index rose about 7% in the third quarter that ended Tuesday, led by artificial-intelligence-related investments that some believe are primed for a correction. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis showed that households and nonprofits were investing about 45.4% of their assets in corporate equities as of the second quarter of 2025 — the highest exposure to stocks ever. An estimated 62% of Americans own stock as of May, matching 2024 and the highest level since 2007, according to the polling firm Gallup. And Federal Reserve data analyzed by the Securities and Exchange Commission shows the median U.S. household had about $52,000 in stock holdings as of 2022, compared with nearly $46,000 in 2019. Analysts say there are myriad reasons for this trend line; trading apps such as Robinhood and Webull have made it easier to invest small amounts of money in companies and index funds. It also explains the rise in meme stocks — shares of a company that go viral by way of social media sites such as Reddit. The expansion of 401(k) accounts, spurred by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, means more workers are automatically enrolled in retirement plans that include stocks and bonds. The stock surge has created an influx of millionaires, according to Fidelity Investments, one of the largest administrators of workplace retirement plans. Fidelity had 595,000 accounts with balances in excess of $1 million at the end of the second quarter, up nearly 20% year over year. Personal finance experts also point to the role of emotions in setting investment trends. The spectacular stock market gains of 2020 and 2021 have also led to a sense of FOMO — fear of missing out — as people want to position themselves for the next rally, said Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning at Morningstar. “We’ve also enjoyed a fairly strong economy for a decade-plus, and economic expansion tends to give households more leeway in their budgets to invest for the long term, and more confidence to do so,” Benz said. Meanwhile, Wall Street looked past the looming government shutdown on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 closing out the last day of the third quarter with a 0.4% gain; the index is now up 13.7% for the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed more than 9% since the start of 2025, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq has soared 17.3%. And the Russell 2000 index of small-cap companies is up 9.3% for the year. The third quarter has historically been “the most challenging quarter of the year,” notes CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall, who closely tracks the stock market’s historic performance. October, by comparison, has been associated with a number of volatile “shakeout events,” Stovall said, possibly because it coincides with the end of the fiscal year for many mutual funds, meaning fund managers often adjust their portfolios. Historically, “there is more rain in September, but more wind in October,” Stovall said. Wall Street’s gains overlay a mixed economic picture. Inflation ticked up to 2.9% in August to the fastest pace since January, fueling stagflation worries. Though unemployment remains relatively low, at 4.3%, U.S. employers created far fewer positions during much of 2024 and the early part of 2025 than previously reported, according to recent federal data. Analysts say the most recent market gains got a nudge from the Federal Reserve, which lowered its benchmark rate by a quarter-point on Sept. 17, citing a cooling labor market. That should mean lower borrowing costs for Americans looking to buy homes or wanting to start or grow businesses. Falling rates could help companies reduce debt or invest more in their operations. But any development that affects the Fed’s plans — such as an unexpectedly high inflation reading or new tariffs — could spook the markets, said Michael Farr, an analyst with the D.C.-based Farr, Miller & Washington. “What happens if tariff inflation shows up and the Fed says, ‘Wait a minute’? We’re already moving into the thin branches of risk, solely based on these price levels,” Farr said. As a result, Farr said, investing in 2025 is “anything but a no-brainer,” because buying into the stock market means paying for stocks at near-record prices. “Stock ownership means that you own a small piece of corporate America,” Farr said. “While you never want to bet against corporate America, you never want to pay the highest price anyone has ever paid.” The market has been buoyed by continued enthusiasm around artificial intelligence, with big tech companies including Oracle, Palantir, and Meta driving a significant share of the market’s gains. Investors could be at risk if the new technology fails to deliver returns that are commensurate with the hundreds of billions of dollars being spent on data centers, energy, and other aspects of AI infrastructure. And some analysts believe AI stocks are overvalued, creating the risk of a bubble. A recent order making it easier for everyday savers to invest retirement funds in alternative assets such as private equity, real estate, and cryptocurrencies could further increase risks for investors, said Corey Frayer, of the nonprofit Consumer Federation of America. Still, analysts cautioned that the most successful investors tend to keep a longtime horizon and avoid overreacting in the short term. “The biggest risk is that, if we have a sell-off, these newer investors could cash out at the bottom,” said Wayne Wicker, president of McLean, Va.-based Opal Capital. “Markets can go a lot further with rich valuations than most people expect.”

Here's your firmware update for October 4, 2025 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. This week has rounded off September, or Tech-tember as we call it, with the last few events of the month, from Amazon to Google's big hardware and software reveals. We also watched the internet implode as Xbox Game Pass got a major price hike, leading many to question if the subscription is still a good deal for them. To catch up on all of this and more, scroll down for our recap of the week's seven biggest tech news stories. For ICYMI, we don’t normally include reports based on leaks and speculation, as while they can be right on the money, they can also be way off the mark – even from often reliable sources. We’re making an exception here as Samsung Display’s president Lee Cheong has said that the company is preparing to mass produce foldable phone panels for a North American client, and only one company comes to mind as this mysterious buyer: Apple. That’s because the long-awaited foldable iPhone is rumored to be launching next year, and Samsung Display has long been making its other iPhone screens. We’ve heard numerous rumors about what the foldable iPhone might look like, but expect something thin – it might even be thinner than the 5.6mm iPhone Air when unfolded. Pricing-wise, the most recent leaked price we’ve heard is $1,999 (around £1,500 / AU$3,050). The much-hyped Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses are finally available to the public in the US, and you can even book a demo to give them a whirl. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. This wearable is essentially Meta’s existing Ray-Ban smart glasses with a screen attached, offering additional functionality such as on-screen navigation, notification pop-ups, and even support for video calls. But with pairs starting at $799, you probably want to try them before you buy them. That’s why, using Meta’s official scheduler page, you can find a retailer near you offering 25-minute demos. Just be prepared to wait a while, as demos are already booked up for months – although as more stores offer the specs and roll them out to more regions, it should become easier to book a demo slot. Tilly Norwood is an AI ‘actress’ from “the world’s first artificial intelligence (AI) talent studio,” Xicoia, and she burst onto the scene via social media to look for agent representation. The creator asked folks to “judge her by merit,” but we and many others – especially notable Hollywood figures – have decided she’s a terrifying prospect for the world of entertainment that could remove humanity from upcoming shows and films. At these times, we can't help thinking of that viral quote from Joanna Maciejewska when it comes to the likes of Tilly Norwood: "I want AI to do my laundry and dishes so I can do art and writing, not for AI to do my art and writing so that I can do my laundry and dishes." If you use Meta AI’s chatbot on Facebook and Instagram, you might want to reconsider, as beginning December 16, your chats will influence the ads you see – and at the time of writing, you can’t opt out. "For example, if you chat with Meta AI about hiking, we may learn that you’re interested in hiking – just as we would if you posted a reel about hiking or liked a hiking-related Page. As a result, you might start seeing recommendations for hiking groups, posts from friends about trails, or ads for hiking boots," Meta explained in its announcement. Meta may be a pioneer here, but Google has discussed showing ads in Gemini and its AI Overviews, which appear at the top of search, while Amazon is using conversations with its Rufus AI chatbot for similar purposes. On Tuesday, Amazon held a huge hardware event in New York, and we were right there in the audience, bringing you the full lowdown on every device as it was announced. Some of the highlights included the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft, which feels just like writing on paper, integrates with OneDrive and Google Docs, new Echo smart speakers and smart displays, three new Fire TVs, and updated Ring cameras and doorbells. Everything is infused with AI courtesy of Alexa+, and we were able to get our hands (and ears) on everything to bring you our first impressions as soon as the presentations were over. Google’s smart home tech is finally set to get the much-anticipated Gemini update, which will bring more conversational interactions, improved assistance for setting up your automations, and better object detection for your smart cameras. Unfortunately, for the best features, you’ll need to start paying for a Google Home Premium subscription – yours for $10 a month or $100 a year (the Standard tier), or $20 a month or $200 a year (the Advanced tier). The good news is you won’t need to upgrade to the new Google Home Speaker (though you can if you want), as the update will be supported by all of Google’s home tech launched in the last decade. Microsoft set the internet on fire by announcing big changes coming to Xbox Game Pass. That is that a top-tier Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription now costs $29.99 / £22.99 / AU$35.95. This means that a year of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate – at $359.88 – costs only a little less than an Xbox Series S – with its recently increased $379.99 price. Now, Ultimate does come with some useful benefits. It now includes a Fortnite Crew membership (which nets you skins, 1,000 V-Bucks per month, and the Battle Pass), Ubisoft+ Classics (curated classic Ubisoft games), and shorter wait times and 1440p resolution when streaming. That said, many gamers haven’t taken this news well, with the page players would use to cancel their subscriptions crashing. Yikes! Don’t worry completely about the price rise, as you can still get Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for $19.99 per month for now – while stock lasts.

Title: Sam Altman on AI bubble: ‘People make some dumb capital allocations’ from time to time

OpenAI could now be the world’s most valuable startup, ahead of Elon Musk’s SpaceX and TikTok’s parent company ByteDance, after a secondary stock sale designed to retain employees at the ChatGPT maker. Current and former OpenAI employees sold $6.6 billion in shares to a group of investors, pushing the privately held artificial intelligence company’s valuation to $500 billion, according to a source with knowledge of the deal who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The investors buying the shares included Thrive Capital, Dragoneer Investment Group and T. Rowe Price, along with Japanese tech giant SoftBank and the United Arab Emirates’ MGX, the source said Thursday. The valuation reflects high expectations for the future of AI technology and continues OpenAI’s remarkable trajectory from its start as a nonprofit research lab in 2015. But with the San Francisco-based company not yet turning a profit, it could also amplify concerns about an AI bubble if the generative AI products made by OpenAI and its competitors don’t meet the expectations of investors pouring billions of dollars into research and development. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has sought to dismiss those concerns, most recently last week, when he toured a massive data center complex being built to run the company’s AI systems in Abilene, Texas. “Between the ten years we’ve already been operating and the many decades ahead of us, there will be booms and busts,” Altman said after being asked about a bubble. “People will overinvest and lose money, and underinvest and lose a lot of revenue.” He added that “we’ll make some dumb capital allocations” and there will be short-term ups and downs but that “over the arc that we have to plan over, we are confident that this technology will drive a new wave of unprecedented economic growth,” along with scientific breakthroughs, improvements to quality of life and “new ways to express creativity.” Just this week, the company launched two different business ventures, one a partnership with Etsy and Shopify for online shopping through ChatGPT and another a social media app, Sora, for generating and sharing AI videos. OpenAI has been struggling to offer investors and staff the same perks and compensation as the publicly traded tech giants with which it competes. Facebook parent Meta Platforms, in particular, has been on a hiring spree for elite AI engineers and in June made a $14.3 billion investment in AI company Scale that recruited its CEO Alexandr Wang. OpenAI’s for-profit subsidiary, valued at $500 billion, is technically controlled by the board of OpenAI’s nonprofit and both are still bound to pursue the nonprofit’s charitable purpose. OpenAI’s partnerships with major companies and its plans to change its corporate structure have drawn the scrutiny of regulators, including the attorneys general of California and Delaware, who oversee charitable organizations that operate or are incorporated in their states. The company has made big deals in recent weeks with Oracle and SoftBank, its partners on a data center venture called Stargate, and with chipmaker Nvidia, which makes the specialized AI chips those data centers need. At the same time, it has lessened its reliance on longtime backer Microsoft. In September, OpenAI announced it had reached a tentative agreement with Microsoft about the future stake of its nonprofit in its for-profit corporation but released few details. It also opened applications for nonprofits to apply for $50 million in funding from OpenAI, an effort it launched in response to the recommendations of an advisory board. The grants will go toward projects that increase public understanding of AI, support the design of AI for uses that communities want and increase economic opportunity. The deadline to apply closes on Oct. 8. —— AP Philanthropy Writer Thalia Beaty contributed to this report. ———- The Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of AP’s text archives. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

You won't want to start your day without it. By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin BTC$111,480.33 may be entering a decisive phase as macro and crypto-specific forces converge. With the U.S. government shutdown and traditional market indicators like employment reports delayed, traders are leaning into alternative assets, especially bitcoin and gold. BTC climbed to $120,000 after rallying 9% this week, while gold rose 2.9% to touch $3,900. The shutdown has furloughed over 90% of SEC staff and left the CFTC with a skeleton crew. Reacting to the shutdown markets rallied, as investors see the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates by 25 bps later this month as a near certainty over an unexpected drop in U.S. private payrolls and a delay in other key economic data. “Traders have lacked immediate catalysts, evidenced by subdued commitment following the FOMC meeting, even as gold and equities have posted strong gains. However, the broader trend remains higher as we move into a rate-cutting cycle,” Jake Ostrovskis, Head of OTC Trading at Wintermute, told CoinDesk. Lower interest rates make risk assets like cryptocurrencies more attractive, and that’s coming in a month where sentiment is high given historical performance. "October has historically been a bullish month for bitcoin, and early signs suggest this year may be no exception." said Gadi Chait of Xapo Bank, in an emailed statement. "Far from being a speculative outlier, bitcoin continues to show its ability to defy the odds and assert itself as a digital asset with staying power.” On-chain data backs that up. Apparent bitcoin demand has grown by roughly 62,000 BTC per month since July, according to CryptoQuant, driven largely by ETFs and whales. For context, ETF holdings surged by 71% in fourth-quarter 2024. On top of that, the crypto-native market has kept on growing. “Over the past month, DeFi’s share of trading activity has been climbing significantly, expanding both the market and our opportunity,” dYdX Labs President Eddie Zhang told CoinDesk. “A big driver of this shift is the renewed energy and participation we’re seeing out of Asia. We believe DeFi is beginning to fulfill its long-standing promise, and the pace of market adoption is accelerating in response." Looking ahead, crypto markets are anticipating other potential catalysts: ETF decisions for several altcoins including solana and XRP that could be delayed over the shutdown, and Ethereum’s Fusaka upgrade, which is slowly moving closer.

Title: The AI Bubble and the U.S. Economy: How Long Do “Hallucinations” Last?

Read about why we’re doing this fundraiser, what we’ve accomplished in the last year, and our current goal, supporting our expanded daily Links Yves here. This is a devastating, must-read paper by Servaas Storm on how AI is failing to meet core, repeatedly hyped performance promises, and never can, irrespective of how much money and computing power is thrown at it. Yet AI, which Storm calls “Artificial Information” is still garnering worse-than-dot-com-frenzy valuations even as errors are if anything increasing. By Servaas Storm, Senior Lecturer of Economics, Delft University of Technology. Originally published at the Institute for New Economic Thinking website This paper argues that (i) we have reached “peak GenAI” in terms of current Large Language Models (LLMs); scaling (building more data centers and using more chips) will not take us further to the goal of “Artificial General Intelligence” (AGI); returns are diminishing rapidly; (ii) the AI-LLM industry and the larger U.S. economy are experiencing a speculative bubble, which is about to burst. The U.S. is undergoing an extraordinary AI-fueled economic boom: The stock market is soaring thanks to exceptionally high valuations of AI-related tech firms, which are fueling economic growth by the hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars they are spending on data centers and other AI infrastructure. The AI investment boom is based on the belief that AI will make workers and firms significantly more productive, which will in turn boost corporate profits to unprecedented levels. But the summer of 2025 did not bring good news for enthusiasts of generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) who were all hyped up by the inflated promise of the likes of OpenAI’s Sam Altman that “Artificial General Intelligence” (AGI), the holy grail of current AI research, would be right around the corner. Let us more closely consider the hype. Already in January 2025, Altman wrote that “we are now confident we know how to build AGI”. Altman’s optimism echoed claims by OpenAI’s partner and major financial backer Microsoft, which had put out a paper in 2023 claiming that the GPT-4 model already exhibited “sparks of AGI.” Elon Musk (in 2024) was equally confident that the Grok model developed by his company xAI would reach AGI, an intelligence “smarter than the smartest human being”, probably by 2025 or at least by 2026. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that his company was committed to “building full general intelligence”, and that super-intelligence is now “in sight”. Likewise, Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of Anthropic, said “powerful AI”, i.e., smarter than a Nobel Prize winner in any field, could come as early as 2026, and usher in a new age of health and abundance — the U.S. would become a “country of geniuses in a datacenter”, if ….. AI didn’t wind up killing us all. For Mr. Musk and his GenAI fellow travelers, the biggest hurdle on the road to AGI is the lack of computing power (installed in data centers) to train AI bots, which, in turn, is due to a lack of sufficiently advanced computer chips. The demand for more data and more data-crunching capabilities will require about $3 trillion in capital just by 2028, in the estimation of Morgan Stanley. That would exceed the capacity of the global credit and derivative securities markets. Spurred by the imperative to win the AI-race with China, the GenAI propagandists firmly believe that the U.S. can be put on the yellow brick road to the Emerald City of AGI by building more data centers faster (an unmistakenly “accelerationist” expression). Interestingly, AGI is an ill-defined notion, and perhaps more of a marketing concept used by AI promotors to persuade their financiers to invest in their endeavors. Roughly, the idea is that an AGI model can generalize beyond specific examples found in its training data, similar to how some human beings can do almost any kind of work after having been shown a few examples of how to do a task, by learning from experience and changing methods when needed. AGI bots will be capable of outsmarting human beings, creating new scientific ideas, and doing innovative as well as all of routine coding. AI bots will be telling us how to develop new medicines to cure cancer, fix global warming, drive our cars and grow our genetically modified crops. Hence, in a radical bout of creative destruction, AGI would transform not just the economy and the workplace, but also systems of health care, energy, agriculture, communications, entertainment, transportation, R&D, innovation and science. OpenAI’s Altman boasted that AGI can “discover new science,” because “I think we’ve cracked reasoning in the models,” adding that “we’ve a long way to go.” He “think[s] we know what to do,” saying that OpenAI’s o3 model “is already pretty smart,” and that he’s heard people say “wow, this is like a good PhD.” Announcing the launch of ChatGPT-5 in August, Mr. Altman posted on the internet that “We think you will love using GPT-5 much more than any previous Al. It is useful, it is smart, it is fast [and] intuitive. With GPT-5 now, it’s like talking to an expert — a legitimate PhD level expert in anything any area you need on demand, they can help you with whatever your goals are.” But then things began to fall apart, and rather quickly so. ChatGPT-5 Is a Letdown The first piece of bad news is that much-hyped ChatGPT-5 turned out to be a dud — incremental improvements wrapped in a routing architecture, nowhere near the breakthrough to AGI that Sam Altman had promised. Users are underwhelmed. As the MIT Technology Review reports: “The much-hyped release makes several enhancements to the ChatGPT user experience. But it’s still far short of AGI.” Worryingly, OpenAI’s internal tests show GPT-5 ‘hallucinates’ in circa one in 10 responses of the time on certain factual tasks, when connected to the internet. However, without web-browsing access, GPT-5 is wrong in almost 1 in 2 responses, which should be troublesome. Even more worrisome, ‘hallucinations’ may also reflect biases buried within datasets. For instance, an LLM might ‘hallucinate’ crime statistics that align with racial or political biases simply because it has learned from biased data. Of note here is that AI chatbots can be and are actively used to spread misinformation (see here and here). According to recent research, chatbots spread false claims when prompted with questions about controversial news topics 35% of the time — almost double the 18% rate of a year ago (here). AI curates, orders, presents, and censors information, influencing interpretation and debate, while pushing dominant (average or preferred) viewpoints while suppressing alternatives, quietly removing inconvenient facts or making up convenient ones. The key issue is: Who controls the algorithms? Who sets the rules for the tech bros? It is evident that by making it easy to spread “realistic-looking” misinformation and biases and/or suppress critical evidence or argumentation, GenAI does and will have non-negligible societal costs and risks — which have to be counted when assessing its impacts. Building Larger LLMs Is Leading Nowhere The ChatGPT-5 episode raises serious doubts and existential questions about whether the GenAI industry’s core strategy of building ever-larger models on ever-larger data distributions has already hit a wall. Critics, including cognitive scientist Gary Marcus (here and here), have long argued that simply scaling up LLMs will not lead to AGI, and GPT-5’s sorry stumbles do validate those concerns. It is becoming more widely understood that LLMs are not constructed on proper and robust world models, but instead are built to autocomplete, based on sophisticated pattern-matching — which is why, for example, they still cannot even play chess reliably and continue to make mind-boggling errors with startling regularity. My new INET Working Paper discusses three sobering research studies showing that novel ever-larger GenAI models do not become better, but worse, and do not reason, but rather parrot reasoning-like text. To illustrate, a recent paper by scientists at MIT and Harvard shows that even when trained on all of physics, LLMs fail to uncover even the existing generalized and universal physical principles underlying their training data. Specifically, Vafa et al. (2025) note that LLMs that follow a “Kepler-esque” approach: they can successfully predict the next position in a planet’s orbit, but fail to find the underlying explanation of Newton’s Law of Gravity (see here). Instead, they resort to fitting made-up rules, that allow them to successfully predict the planet’s next orbital position, but these models fail to find the force vector at the heart of Newton’s insight. The MIT-Harvard paper is explained in this video. LLMs cannot and do not infer physical laws from their training data. Remarkably, they cannot even identify the relevant information from the internet. Instead, they make it up. Worse, AI bots are incentivized to guess (and give an incorrect response) rather than admit they do not know something. This problem is recognized by researchers from OpenAI in a recent paper. Guessing is rewarded — because, who knows, it might be right. The error is at present uncorrectable. Accordingly, it might well be prudent to think of “Artificial Information” rather than “Artificial Intelligence” when using the acronym AI. The bottom line is straightforward: this is very bad news for anyone hoping that further scaling — building ever larger LLMs — would lead to better outcomes (see also Che 2025). 95% of Generative AI Pilot Projects in Companies Are Failing Corporations had rushed to announce AI investments or claim AI capabilities for their products in the hope of turbocharging their share prices. Then came the news that the AI tools are not doing what they are supposed to do and that people are realizing it (see Ed Zitron). An August 2025 report titled The GenAI Divide: State of AI in Business 2025, published by MIT’s NANDA initiative, concludes that 95% of generative AI pilot projects in companies are failing to raise revenue growth. As reported by Fortune, “generic tools like ChatGPT [….] stall in enterprise use since they don’t learn from or adapt to workflows”. Quite. Indeed, firms are backpedaling after cutting hundreds of jobs and replacing these by AI. For instance, Swedish “Buy Burritos Now, Pay Later” Klarna bragged in March 2024 that its AI assistant was doing the work of (laid-off) 700 workers, only to rehire them (sadly, as gig workers) in the summer of 2025 (see here). Other examples include IBM, forced to reemploy staff after laying off about 8,000 workers to implement automation (here). Recent U.S. Census Bureau data by firm size show that AI adoption has been declining among companies with more than 250 employees. MIT economist Daren Acemoglu (2025) predicts rather modest productivity impacts of AI in the next 10 years and warns that some applications of AI may have negative social value. “We’re still going to have journalists, we’re still going to have financial analysts, we’re still going to have HR employees,” Acemoglu says. “It’s going to impact a bunch of office jobs that are about data summary, visual matching, pattern recognition, etc. And those are essentially about 5% of the economy.” Similarly, using two large-scale AI adoption surveys (late 2023 and 2024) covering 11 exposed occupations (25,000 workers in 7,000 workplaces) in Denmark, Anders Humlum and Emilie Vestergaard (2025) show, in a recent NBER Working Paper, that the economic impacts of GenAI adoption are minimal: “AI chatbots have had no significant impact on earnings or recorded hours in any occupation, with confidence intervals ruling out effects larger than 1%. Modest productivity gains (average time savings of 3%), combined with weak wage pass-through, help explain these limited labor market effects.” These findings provide a much-needed reality check for the hyperbole that GenAI is coming for all of our jobs. Reality is not even close. GenAI will not even make tech workers who do the coding redundant, contrary to the prediction by AI enthusiasts. OpenAI researchers have found (in early 2025) that advanced AI models (including GPT-4o and Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet) still are no match for human coders. The AI bots failed to grasp how widespread bugs are or to understand their context, leading to solutions that are incorrect or insufficiently comprehensive. Another new study from the nonprofit Model Evaluation and Threat Research (METR) finds that in practice, programmers, using early 2025-AI-tools, are actually slower when using AI assistance tools, spending 19 percent more time when using GenAI than when actively coding by themselves (see here). Programmers spent their time on reviewing AI outputs, prompting AI systems, and correcting AI-generated code. The U.S. Economy at Large Is Hallucinating The disappointing rollout of ChatGPT-5 raises doubts about OpenAI’s ability to build and market consumer products that users are willing to pay for. But the point I want to make is not just about OpenAI: the American AI industry as a whole has been built on the premise that AGI is just around the corner. All that is needed is sufficient “compute”, i.e., millions of Nvidia AI GPUs, enough data centers and sufficient cheap electricity to do the massive statistical pattern mapping needed to generate (a semblance of) “intelligence”. This, in turn, means that “scaling” (investing billions of U.S. dollars in chips and data centers) is the one-and-only way forward — and this is exactly what the tech firms, Silicon Valley venture capitalists and Wall Street financiers are good at: mobilizing and spending funds, this time for “scaling-up” generative AI and building data centers to support all the expected future demand for AI use. During 2024 and 2025, Big Tech firms invested a staggering $750 billion in data centers in cumulative terms and they plan to roll out a cumulative investment of $3 trillion in data centers during 2026-2029 (Thornhill 2025). The so-called “Magnificent 7” (Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla) spent more than $100 billion on data centers in the second quarter of 2025; Figure 1 gives the capital expenditures for four of the seven corporations. FIGURE 1 Christopher Mims (2025), https://x.com/mims/status/1951… The surge in corporate investment in “information processing equipment” is huge. According to Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, data center investments’ contribution to (sluggish) real U.S. GDP growth has been the same as consumer spending over the first half of 2025 (Figure 2). Financial investor Paul Kedrosky finds that capital expenditures on AI data centers (in 2025) have passed the peak of telecom spending during the dot-com bubble (of 1995-2000). FIGURE 2 Source: Torsten Sløk (2025). https://www.apolloacademy.com/… Following the AI hype and hyperbole, tech stocks have gone through the roof. The S&P500 Index rose by circa 58% during 2023-2024, driven mostly by the growth of the share prices of the Magnificent Seven. The weighted-average share price of these seven corporations increased by 156% during 2023-2024, while the other 493 firms experienced an average increase in their share prices of just 25%. America’s stock market is largely AI-driven. Nvidia’s shares rose by more than 280% over the past two years amid the exploding demand for its GPUs coming from the AI firms; as one of the most high-profile beneficiaries of the insatiable demand for GenAI, Nvidia now has a market capitalization of more than $4 trillion, which is the highest valuation ever recorded for a publicly traded company. Does this valuation make sense? Nvidia’s price-earnings (P/E) ratio peaked at 234 in July 2023 and has since declined to 47.6 in September 2025 — which is still historically very high (see Figure 3). Nvidia is selling its GPUs to neocloud companies (such as CoreWeave, Lambda, and Nebius), which are funded by credit, from Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Blackstone and other Wall Street private equity firms, collateralized by the data centers filled with GPUs. In key cases, as explained by Ed Zitron, Nvidia offered the neocloud companies, which are loss making, to buy unsold cloud compute worth billions of U.S. dollars, effectively backstopping its clients — all in the expectation of an AI revolution that still has to arrive. Likewise, the share price of Oracle Corp. (which is not included in the “Magnificent 7”) rose by more than 130% during mid-May and early September 2025 following the announcement of its $300 billion cloud-computing infrastructure deal with OpenAI. Oracle’s P/E ratio shot up to almost 68, which means that financial investors are willing to pay almost $68 for $1 of Oracle’s future earnings. One obvious problem with this deal is that OpenAI doesn’t have $300 billion; the company made a loss of $15 billion during 2023-2025 and is projected to make a further cumulative loss of $28 billion during 2026-2028 (see below). It is unclear and uncertain where OpenAI will get the money from. Ominously, Oracle needs to build the infrastructure for OpenAI before it can collect any revenue. If OpenAI cannot pay for the enormous computing capacity it agreed to buy from Oracle, which seems likely, Oracle will be left with the expensive AI infrastructure, for which it may not be able to find alternative customers, especially once the AI bubble fizzles out. Tech stocks thus are considerably overvalued. Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, warned (in July 2025) that AI stocks are even more overvalued than dot-com stocks were in 1999. In a blogpost, he illustrates how P/E ratios of Nvidia, Microsoft and eight other tech companies are higher than during the dot-com era (see Figure 3). We all remember how the dot-com bubble ended — and hence Sløk is right in sounding the alarm over the apparent market mania, driven by the “Magnificent 7” that are all heavily invested in the AI industry. Big Tech does not buy these data centers and operate them itself; instead the data centers are built by construction companies and then purchased by data center operators who lease them to (say) OpenAI, Meta or Amazon (see here). Wall Street private equity firms such as Blackstone and KKR are investing billions of dollars to buy up these data center operators, using commercial mortgage-backed securities as source funding. Data center real estate is a new, hyped-up asset class that is beginning to dominate financial portfolios. Blackstone calls data centers one of its “highest conviction investments.” Wall Street loves the lease-contracts of data centers which offer long-term stable, predictable income, paid by AAA-rated clients like AWS, Microsoft and Google. Some Cassandras are warning of a potential oversupply of data centers, but given that “the future will be based on GenAI”, what could possibly go wrong? FIGURE 3 Source: Torsten Sløk (2025), https://www.apolloacademy.com/… In a rare moment of frankness, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had it right. “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI?” Altman said during a dinner interview with reporters in San Francisco in August. “My opinion is yes.” He also compared today’s AI investment frenzy to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. “Someone’s gonna get burned there, I think,” Altman said. “Someone is going to lose a phenomenal amount of money – we don’t know who …”, but (going by what happened in earlier bubbles) it will most likely not be Altman himself. The question therefore is: How long investors will continue to prop up sky-high valuations of the key firms in the GenAI race remains to be seen. Earnings of the AI industry continue to pale in comparison to the tens of billions of U.S. dollars that are spent on data center growth. According to an upbeat S&P Global research note published in June, 2025 the GenAI market is projected to generate $85 billion in revenue 2029. However, Alphabet, Google, Amazon and Meta together will spend nearly $400 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 alone. At the same time, the AI industry has a combined revenue that is little more than the revenue of the smart-watch industry (Zitron 2025). So, what if GenAI just is not profitable? This question is pertinent in view of the rapidly diminishing returns to the stratospheric capital expenditures on GenAI and data centers and the disappointing user-experience of 95% of firms that adopted AI. One of the largest hedge funds in the world, Florida-based Elliott, told clients that AI is overhyped and Nvidia is in a bubble, adding that many AI products are “never going to be cost-efficient, never going to actually work right, will take up too much energy, or will prove to be untrustworthy.” “There are few real uses,” it said, other than “summarizing notes of meetings, generating reports and helping with computer coding”. It added that it was “skeptical” that Big Tech companies would keep buying the chipmaker’s graphics processing units in such high volumes. Locking billions of U.S. dollars in into AI-focused data centers without a clear exit strategy for these investments in case the AI craze ends, only means that systemic risk in finance and the economy is building. With data-center investments driving U.S. economic growth, the American economy has become dependent on a handful of corporations, which have not yet managed to generate one dollar of profit on the ‘compute’ done by these data center investments. America’s High-Stakes Geopolitical Get Gone Wrong The AI boom (bubble) developed with the support of both major political parties in the U.S. The vision of American firms pushing the AI frontier and reaching GenAI first is widely shared — in fact, there is a bipartisan consensus on how important it is that the U.S. should win the global AI race. America’s industrial capability is critically dependent on a number of potential adversary nation-states, including China. In this context, America’s lead in GenAI is considered to constitute a potential very powerful geopolitical lever: If America manages to get to AGI first, so the analysis goes, it can build up an overwhelming long-term advantage over especially China (see Farrell). That is the reason why Silicon Valley, Wall Street and the Trump administration are doubling down on the “AGI First” strategy. But astute observers highlight the costs and risks of this strategy. Prominently, Eric Schmidt and Selina Xuworry, in the New York Times of August 19, 2025, that “Silicon Valley has grown so enamored with accomplishing this goal [of AGI] that it’s alienating the general public and, worse, bypassing crucial opportunities to use the technology that already exists. In being solely fixated on this objective, our nation risks falling behind China, which is far less concerned with creating A.I. powerful enough to surpass humans and much more focused on using the technology we have now.” Schmidt and Xu are rightly worried. Perhaps the plight of the U.S. economy is captured best by OpenAI’s Sam Altman who fantasizes about putting his data centers in space: “Like, maybe we build a big Dyson sphere around the solar system and say, “Hey, it actually makes no sense to put these on Earth.”” For as long as such ‘hallucinations’ on using solar-collecting satellites to harvest (unlimited) star power continue to convince gullible financial investors, the government and users of the “magic” of AI and the AI industry, the U.S. economy is surely doomed. OpenAI’s Altman boasted that AGI can “discover new science,” because “I think we’ve cracked reasoning in the models,” Clearly Altman doesn’t know how science is done. I have, for instance, done an AI search on a theme I used to be an expert years ago namely the cell-to-cell-movement of viruses in plants. With google AI what you obtain is a rehash of ideas more or less currently known. Very importantly, it comes without caveats, critical thinking and without any real experimental data already obtained with its experimental context. The first thing a researcher has to do is to be very critical on any data obtained before, conscientious that all that data was obtained in certain experimental conditions which very frequently result in situations in which the functioning of things are altered or controlled. In this sense, many research results are artificial artefacts and the results of research are often misleading and needing more checks and controls. I very well remember a congress (in Capetown 2001) about plasmodesmata , structures that bridge and communicate plant cells. Virus cell-to-cell movement was amongst the main issues in this small, very specialized, meeting. In a session dedicated to this issue there was a researcher exposing a vast body of research the lab had been doing using state-of-the-art methodology. This included data already published (several articles) and in the same line of research new data to be published soon with important conclusions. In the same session, a different research group using different state-of-the-art methodologies obtained results which suggested conclusions quite different to those that the first group had reached. There was a very interesting and heated discussion on the matter. It was obvious that one of the researchers had immersed in a rabbit hole of experimental artefacts. You can call it hallucinatory results. So humans can indeed hallucinate sometimes and this is apparently what AI machines are learning top do: hallucinate. Starting any research with the very redacted rehash of ideas without any kind of critical thinking looks to me the exact recipe for hallucinatory AI-driven research. In the same session, a different research group using different state-of-the-art methodologies obtained results which suggested conclusions quite different to those that the first group had reached. There was a very interesting and heated discussion on the matter. It was obvious that one of the researchers had immersed in a rabbit hole of experimental artefacts. You can call it hallucinatory results. So humans can indeed hallucinate sometimes and this is apparently what AI machines are learning top do: hallucinate. You’ve touched upon what AI boosters are hoping for (AGI) and what the limitations of the current state of affairs are and why humans will be sticking around, especially in knowledge generation fields, for some time still. I remember there being some links here on Naked Capitalism that touched on symbolic computation, and how that got discarded for machine learning/statistical approaches in AI, which were highly successful in tackling computer vision/classification problems, and led to a winter in research in symbolic methods, which researchers are slowly rediscovering will be essential for AGI. In this case, symbolic computation would be invaluable for any type of “thinking machine” to simplify contradictory information into abstract logical terms, recognize they form a contradictory set of statements, and then work around that to identify what could be the cause of contradiction, and how it could be resolved, while recognizing a limitation in its own knowledge set to be able to resolve it. Much of scientific research is dedicated to finding and resolving these contradictions. Phenomenon A predicts X happens in some novel set of circumstances. Phenomenon B predicts Y happens in the same novel set of circumstances. Except in pure mathematics, you can’t ‘reason’ your way through whether A and/or B will fail when tested in those novel circumstances. Likewise as you described, testing a phenomenon A in circumstances X and in presumably the same circumstances X’ generated different results. Reasoning can help identify what may caused different results in this instance, but current LLMs aren’t performing this type of reasoning. Anyone who’s knowledgeable in physics would understand these limitations. We’ve dedicated billions of hours of research into trying to reconcile quantum physics with general relativity, an instance of where two theories cannot be reconciled where both gravitational and quantum effects are significant. Much of that research gave us string theory, but string theory itself suffers from a lack of testable and verifiable circumstances, and also has gaps in certain circumstances. As for the life sciences, I’ve seen AI boosters try to remark that LLMs are extremely advanced, since now they’ve begun creating “designer viruses” or “designer gene therapies” that are engineered to achieve certain therapeutic or other effects. However, I’ve been frustrated to try and explain that first, it didn’t actually engineer it, it only proposed it, or “hallucinated it” as you said. Until it actually gets tested or synthesized in a lab, there might be some underlying principle it ignored in its proposal that will prevent synthesizing it. Second, we’ve never actually needed LLMs to do this. Maybe COVID induced brain fog in a lot of people, but October 1st this year marked the 25th anniversary of Folding At Home. Distributed protein folding setups were quite popular, where you could have your computer or game console experiment with trying to find potential new organic compounds by simulating protein dynamics. I’ve bolded potential and simulating there, because finding candidates or isolating certain functionality was only half the battle, experiments were still needed to validate the results or exploit the actual predicted behavior of how those proteins interacted. LLMs suggesting novel genetics are using similar statistical mechanisms to do this, albeit in a less specialized, and thus less accurate and energy efficient way. I have a conspiratorial notion that those pushing forward these massive capital spending sprees know these limitations, and maybe their intention is to turn all of these data centers into biomedical research simulation labs when everyone else catches on that simulating clerical work isn’t that profitable. All of these GPUs and hardware setups are well suited to be adapted into giant protein dynamic simulation clusters. However protein folding doesn’t sound as sexy to Silicon valley investors as replacing human workers. Thank you for your interesting reply Chris. Indeed, computing models are very useful for, for instance, simulating protein dynamics, their folding and changes these undergo under different conditions. There is no human brain that can store all the information available and needed for such simulations. The simulations themselves are to be taken with (tons of) grains of salt. Scientists know that these are just simulations. I think that a big effort has been dedicated to obtain improved versions of RUBISCO, the protein that fixes CO2 to be incorporated in organic material and thought to be the most abundant protein in the world (here an example on Machine Learning to accelerate the process). This kind of work is termed in silico analysis. It isn’t obviously experimental. Whether ML will indeed accelerate the process or make it more complicated it is something that has not been readily shown in this case. It might be that other methods based on random procedures are more efficient and faster. Chris N: I have a conspiratorial notion that those pushing forward these massive capital spending sprees know these limitations, and maybe their intention is to turn all of these data centers into biomedical research simulation labs Of course. That’s exactly what’s happening and biomedical research simulations are one intention. Among others. It’s naive to announce the bleeding obvious, that LLMs can’t hyperscale to more AI or to AGI — whatever that is — as the OP above and many commentators here do as if this were a revelation. Or to point out that LLM-based AI is a bubble. Of course, it is — that’s arguably the business model. The executives running the companies building these giant datacenters almost all went through the dotcom bubble, after all. Ask the next question. (You’re the only person here I’ve seen starting to do that, Chris.) What are they going to do with all that compute besides LLMs? How much compute are we talking about? Currently, the world’s fastest supercomputer is El Capitan, at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, capable of 2.746 exaFLOPS — https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Capitan_(supercomputer). Microsoft is building Fairwater, an AI-focused datecenter in Wisconsin, operational in 2026 that will by comparison supposedly do 17 exaFLOPS and, via massive GPU parallelism, achieve 10x El Capitan’s performance. And this is only one datacenter among others Microsoft is building and which we can presume therefore will get built. (As opposed to speculating, forex, about how much of the Oracle-Softbank-OpenAIStargate effort will come to fruition). So what other kinds of AI architectures can run in such datacenters. Over the next 3 years, here’s some of the roadmap — Large Physics Models (LPMs): Foundation models trained on physics texts, equations, and experimental data, capable of reasoning across scales—from QM to cosmology. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): For modeling relational systems like molecules, social networks, or traffic flows, where entities and their interactions evolve dynamically. Neural PDE Solvers: AI systems that learn to approximate solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), for simulations in fluid dynamics, climate modeling, and fusion energy. Agent-Based Simulation Models (ABMs): These simulate individual decision-makers (humans, cells, vehicles) whose behaviors evolve based on learned rules, for applications in economics, epidemiology, and urban planning. In 3-7 years’ time, the hope/intent is to leverage this massive datacenter compute to develop neuromorphic computing, which will need massively lower energy inputs (i.e. like the human brain). That way, AI can be pushed out the Edge, as it’s now being referred to, with the Edge meaning autonomous cars, robots, etc. Now, how much of this will happen? Well, prediction is hard, especially about the future. But one other factor needs consideration here: we’ve entered a period of geopolitical conflict, unrest, and war, and war generally accelerates technological development — e.g.the state of things pre-WW2 with biplanes and radio to post-WW2, five years later, with jets, rockets, television, and computers. And this is without the climate threat. So, this could a period of greater technological acceleration than we’ve seen in our lifetimes previously. Who’s they? This GPU compute needs to earn some kind of yield that compensates for the risk undertaken by the investors. And it’s only suitable for a handful of very specialized workloads. Who’s going to pay for this cool-sounding science stuff? Capitalists certainly are not altruistic. They can’t do anything like Uber-for-pets with it. Capitalists aren’t altruistic, but they are greedy, and are willing to invest large amounts of money into things if they think they’ll get a return from them, not because they necessarily or actually will get a return from them. In this case T Rowe price, Vanguard, and every other 401k or pension fund manager is basically putting money into this because of the predicted productivity ramifications from it. I.E. worker output is going to double translates to double value generated, translates to double revenue generated, translates to earnings increasing many times over. However, if that doesn’t materialize, and the bubble pops, there will be all of this hardware left over. Even if the hardware is old, it won’t actually be obsolete. I mentioned folding at home, because many of these types of simulations are embarrassingly parallel computational problems, or those where any computer of any power level can contribute towards calculations. Those GPUs will still be useful for anything that requires a lot of matrix multiplication. This means there will be discount sales for a lot of these data centers, providing opportunities for others companies or investors to buy them up for less than what it would have cost to construct them and buy the hardware new. This is the conspiracy that I’m alluding to: Entrepreneurs can’t pitch a use-biochemical-simulations-to-solve-aging start-up because the time horizon is too long, and initial captial cost too risky to convince non-technical investors to pitch in. But if they can convince them to put money into something that they see a return on, and use that to lower the initial capital cost for their own pet project, they’ll go ahead and do that and fund the entire endeavor for either themselves or their associates interested in those ideas after the crash. As a tangentially related thought, Elizabeth Holmes’ former partner is starting up another medical testing and diagnostics company. A lot of people from the Rational/Less-Wrong Sphere, who came up with Effective Altruism and Long-termism, have a deep cult-like interest in trying to overcome death, either by uploading consciousness into machines, or through mastering genetics and developing therapies to reverse aging. If these individuals lacked scruples to defraud investors via cryptocurrency (See Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX), I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re willing to defraud investors because in their moral calculus, raising lifespans to be 10x longer than they are now is worth it, even if some proportion of the population dies from impoverishment from the bubble crashing, because the net result was positive for the survivors. I’ve bolded potential and simulating there, because finding candidates or isolating certain functionality was only half the battle, experiments were still needed to validate the results or exploit the actual predicted behavior of how those proteins interacted. LLMs suggesting novel genetics are using similar statistical mechanisms to do this, albeit in a less specialized, and thus less accurate and energy efficient way. Interesting you mention this, a story in NY Times earlier this week some researchers at OpenAI left to do a startup that takes these kinds of inputs and then claims they’ll have robotic researchers that will actually perform the experimentation itself physically in a lab, presumably a brute force kind of approach to testing. I can only imagine the number of combinations that might need to be tested for any hypothesis. Second, we’ve never actually needed LLMs to do this. Maybe COVID induced brain fog in a lot of people, but October 1st this year marked the 25th anniversary of Folding At Home. Distributed protein folding setups were quite popular, where you could have your computer or game console experiment with trying to find potential new organic compounds by simulating protein dynamics. I believe a similar folding project, AlphaFold, was able to achieve using generative AI/DeepMind what Folding At Home was setting to accomplish; they were awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their achievement. PapP: I believe a similar folding project, AlphaFold, was able to achieve using generative AI/DeepMind what Folding At Home was setting to accomplish Essentially, with some differences. AlphaFold used a transformer architecture to model relationships between amino acids similiarly to how LLMs model word dependencies and has attention mechanisms that work across both sequence and spatial dimensions, similarly to how LLMs track long-range dependencies in text. Differences were no autoregressive token prediction — AlphaFold doesn’t generate sequences, it infers structures — and optimization for protein folding, not open-ended tasks. LLM architectures are pattern-seeking recognition architectures, after all. As Ignacio says above: “There is no human brain that can store all the information available and needed” to work out some biogenetic relationships. Turn an optimized LLM loose on non-semantic data sets and you sometimes get amazing results. ~~ Conversely, giving a free version of ChatGPT semantics-based tasks simply to prove LLMs aren’t really intelligent in order to validate your prior anti-LLM beliefs, as many in the NC commentariat are doing, accomplishes — what? Certainly, it’ll give you the proof that the free LLM system for the masses that you used isn’t intelligent, but just a dumb stochastic pattern-recognition system. But it tells you nothing about what specialized LLMs can achieve at full stretch. So, if you believe it does, who’s the joke on? Because it’s not on the LLM, which is indeed just a dumb stochastic pattern-recognition system. LLM architectures are pattern-seeking recognition architectures, after all. As Ignacio says above: “There is no human brain that can store all the information available and needed” to work out some biogenetic relationships.

This got me thinking about Kurt Gödel and his Numbering System as applied to LLM architecture with regards to patterns/tokens; these are axiomatic systems govern by simple rules woven together into a regression. So if this is the case, then this is an at least formal-like system and will be ultimately be Incomplete even if you account for the largest vocabulary/library of everything ever written (the totality of the Library of Babel from Jorge Borges comes to mind). So is this chase for AGI a fool’s errand if we can’t even prove AGI on a formal level? What does this say about us on a formal level? Maybe we can relate to this other ontological thing as a fellow confused pattern-recognizing being? Not equal but different. Regarding the replacement of journalists i believe that there are some of a kind who can be easily replaced by AI. Those whose work consists on following a script and who are so frequently and sadly found in MSM. AI can probably do it more reliably. In fact they probably use AI tools to write their articles. Nvidia is selling its GPUs to neocloud companies (such as CoreWeave, Lambda, and Nebius), which are funded by credit, from Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Blackstone and other Wall Street private equity firms, collateralized by the data centers filled with GPUs. I think it’s worth pointing out here that these GPUs go obsolete in 6-12 months, so their value drops sharply. Their collateral is like fresh fish. They have to hold on to it, but it will inevitably make a huge stink. Obsolete does not mean useless. Machines that are not state of the art still work and can perform functions that do not require the latest and greatest hardware. However, in a hyper competitive environment, everyone naturally wants to be at the cutting edge. Obsolete means useless as debt collateral, since the asset loses much of its value. It seems that with computer operating systems software (OS), the free & open source (FOSS) Linux has proven to be superior to non-FOSS/closed OS software like Windows. What are the prospects for FOSS in AI/LLM? Is there a similar likelihood that a FOSS software in AI/LLM like DeepSeek will outperform the US closed competitors like OpenAI? If no AI/LLM software is producing the hyped extreme productivity breakthroughs, wouldn’t there be an incentive globally in most nations to use or make limited propietary modifications on DeepSeek instead of the US closed software alternatives. Especially if it is the case that DeepSeek can provide similar quality models with 10% of Meta’s AI software’s computing power. Any computer scientists or financial analysts/economists focused on the InfoTech sector have a take on how a FOSS software like DeepSeek will influence future AI development? “What are the prospects for FOSS in AI/LLM? Is there a similar likelihood that a FOSS software in AI/LLM like DeepSeek will outperform the US closed competitors like OpenAI?” Sure thing bro, just search for “running deep seek on raspberry pi and you’ll get a long list of how to do it and many examples of it running. Raspberry is a very cheap one board computer that runs linux. https://www.hackster.io/ElecrowOfficial/how-to-run-deepseek-on-a-raspberry-pi-5-step-by-step-guide-c2c790 There’s a big difference between what FOSS can do and what it does do. Mostly the difference between what a motivated individual wants and what a pointy haired boss wants. ProNewerDeal claims Linux is superior (I agree, personally), but that hasn’t budged the needle on desktop market share, has it? Sure, you can shoehorn a LLM onto a Pi (it’ll run like molasses in January), but what CEO is going to boast about that to a quarterly analyst conference call? The CapEx orgy is hype driven, not performance driven (duh). This is an apples / oranges question. The real worry is that the current AI ‘productivity’ hype was a head fake to fund the infrastructure, and the real goal is to get everyone hooked on AI (a la Facebook/TicTok), dumb down the population, grab Google’s advertising money firehose and end up owning the mother of all Big Brother propaganda engines. I recently stumbled into some on-line drama about how the latest OpenAI model was messing with paying customer’s feels, by routing “dangerous or emotional” prompts to a safer model which was heavy on the warnings, and offering up information about self harm hotlines and such, rather than playing along like the previous model. Oh the humanity! I gather that paying customers can select the older model, but there’s real-time “psychological analysis” of your prompts so if it judges that you’re veering into dangerous territory, it routes to a newer, safer model. And let me tell you, THEY DONT LIKE IT! From my 30 minute climb down that rabbit hole, I came to the conclusion that there’s already a lot of people well on their way to the LLM addiction you mentioned in your last paragraph. It may not be plain jane FOSS, but Linux derivatives are being used by the biggest of big boys: Inside Google‘s Data Centers: The Operating Systems Powering Google‘s Global Infrastructure https://expertbeacon.com/inside-googles-data-centers-the-operating-systems-powering-googles-global-infrastructure/ Google‘s servers predominantly run customized versions of the open source Linux operating system that have been tuned and hardened for Google‘s unique technical environment. Rather than rely on standard “off-the-shelf” Linux distributions, Google‘s engineering team has modified and secured the Linux kernel and userspace tools to create server operating systems tailored for massive server fleets running containerized workloads. This journey to create a highly optimized server OS began nearly two decades ago and continues to evolve today. In Google‘s early days in the late 1990s, its initial fleet of servers ran a modified version of the Red Hat Linux distribution. However, as the scale and complexity of Google‘s infrastructure increased, its engineers began customizing the OS to meet its specific technical and operational needs. In 2006, Google started work on “goobuntu”, its own in-house distribution of the Debian-based Ubuntu Linux OS [1]. Goobuntu was used for Google‘s corporate desktops and also some of its production servers. For its larger server fleet, Google hardened and slimmed down the Linux distribution even further, removing extraneous packages and attack surfaces. This more spartan Linux system used an in-house software distribution and management tool called Midas. In the 2010s, Google began migrating servers to its latest generation custom Linux distribution known as gLinux [2]. The article also mentions that Linux derivatives are used by Amazon and Facebook. Admittedly, using a Pi for an LLM is probably not going to work too well, but AMD’s latest high end laptop CPUs are bringing some real heat if you want to do LLM at home: Linux on the New Framework Desktop PC! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziZDzrDI7AM That’s definitely NOT a cheap PC, but the LLM performance is pretty astonishing even at that price point. Overall though, I agree that AI is way, way over hyped for what it’s actually doing. But strangely, AI in other countries (at least one other country) is actually doing some pretty amazing stuff: China’s AI hospitals will transform medicine across the world. But not in the United States. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDmFB7AQSR0 China is already a powerhouse in AI for radiology and medical imaging. Next they’re going global. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RJlqhYt2XQ AI in America strikes me as a “cheat”. American elites don’t have to do the real hard work to compete with a country like China (like re-industrialize, bring back R&D, re-create a skilled middle class workforce) , AI will just figure it all out and “poof”, America is on top again! It’s a nice dream for our elites, but it’s a dream that can turn into a nightmare for the rest of us. Glen: AI in America strikes me as a “cheat”. American elites don’t have to do the real hard work to compete with a country like China (like re-industrialize, bring back R&D, re-create a skilled middle class workforce) , AI will just figure it all out and “poof”, America is on top again! It’s a nice dream for our elites .. that can turn into a nightmare for the rest of us. Yes. The trend is broadly recapitulating nuclear, which American capitalism — where corporate elites had to be served and profit before all else — also screwed up. Also, automobiles. Also, airliners (e.g. current Boeing failures). Don’t quote Silicon Valley at me, because that was built on Pentagon money; in 1960, 100 percent of all microprocessor chips it produced were bought by the DoD for ICBM guidance systems and early-warning radar networks like NORAD; as late as 1967, 75 percent of all chips from Silicon Valley were still going to the DoD. It took the Japanese to pioneer transistor/chip based electronic consumer appliances — computer tech for the civilian masses — not the Americans. Thanks for this excellent article. Indeed, the whole idea that LLMs are going to lead to AGI is just a laughable fantasy. Perhaps if Sam Altman hadn’t dropped out of a comp sci program, he might know this, but he’s from a rich family so he could always retreat back into money and vast carelessness. And then we get to the whole issue of data centers, their costs, the investment bubble, etc. Regarding the question about FOSS alternatives, and alternatives to the big data center apps… One of my colleagues has been experimenting with local LLMs. This colleague is a professional software engineer with decades of experience. Key findings about local LLMs: * Vision detection using an Intel Arc A770 (12GB of ram) works but gives many false positives. * Voice commands work only for the simplest commands. Anything beyond “turn on the kitchen light” fails to translate into expected actions. * Trying to write kubernetes YAML — the results are so terrible it’s just laughable. * Code generated in other languages “utter trash”. * Trying to resolve actual networking problems gives the same few suggestions, all of which were incorrect. * Trying to solve networking problems with cloud-based LLMs isn’t much better. * Using the app for an interactive diary, it got stuck in discussion loops after a few days. * Open source LLMs on Hugging Face are always well behind the commercial offerings from OpenAI et alia. Conclusion: currently-available local LLMs are simply not usable for many problems, or will cost too much to produce better results. From my vantage point, a lot of the hype around generative AI is being sustained by people who stumble through vibe coding a basic app and then say “wow, this is amazing — I wrote an app but I didn’t have to learn to code!” Basically, these are people looking for a free lunch. They want to be able to say “I wrote an app” but they don’t want to make the effort to learn a programming language. There are also those who say they want to learn, but in fact they are unwilling to just sit down and read a book. There are hundreds and hundreds of books about many different programming languages, expressly for this purpose. E.g., once upon a time, I read Kernighan and Ritchie’s The C Programming Language. It’s well-written and not very long. This is the tried and true way of doing it. But vibe coders don’t want to make such an effort. They want to “chat” with an AI to “learn” what they would get from simply reading a book. In other words, they want hold-holding and fawning attention from a sycophantic bot, all the way through. The unspoken premise here is that learning a programming language is some sort of insanely difficult task — but is it really? IMO, this leads us directly to a deeper issue, which is people who expect rewards — or actually feel entitled to those rewards — but don’t want to make any effort to get those rewards. What i found more damning is that while there are indeed applications for which de LLM models can be useful and help humans with some cumbersome tasks the big 7 keep focused on AGI. Interesting but boring business models bypassed in the search for some utopian or dystopian tech control of everything. The bubble is very, very high above us. And agreed: very good article. “…once upon a time, I read…” This is actually the key failing of AI. You read and comprehended something. LLM’s are given information to make statistically inferred outputs. They don’t read nor comprehend the information that was provided to them in training. I have some limited experience with local LLMs. It was like working with a 3 year old… but unlike a 3 year old, it never learned and kept making the same mistakes. Once in a while, I got better results without changing anything, and other times worse. Software engineer here. I can’t add much to this, unless the idea of AI code generation is to change my job from thinking about solutions to business concerns to thinking about editing the AI’s probabilistic solutions to business concerns, is the order of the day. Of course the there has been some big talk, but not many takers yet it seems. Amazon made hay over exactly this not long ago, as if the efficiency gains are something you can now take to the bank, and removed “tens of thousands” of workers from their rolls. But a few months later it turns out they just wanted to hire a bunch of H1b visa holders instead. Turns out AI ‘efficiency gains’ are simply wage cuts: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/amazon-blamed-ai-for-layoffs-then-hired-cheap-h1-b-workers-senators-allege/ “Those aren’t eatin’ sardines, their tradin’ sardines.” *they’re too early in the morning to try to be witty. sardine (n.) : “pilchard, type of small oily fish,” migratory and highly esteemed as a food, early 15c., from Latin sardina, sarda, from late Greek sardinē, sardinos, earlier sardē, which is often said to be from or related to Sardō “Sardinia” (see Sardinia), the Mediterranean island, near which the fish probably were caught and from which they were exported. which takes us back to the previous discussion of Sardonic Laughter. When i was in Cali i didn’t ask for pilchards but sardines and it was better understood by many sellers there. You know what happens with fish names: they are local and you have plenty of regional variations which apply to some similar fish species. If you enter “sardine” in fishbase you obtain 63 entries from many different regions representing more than two dozen species besides Sardina pilchardus. My wife has had a curious experience with AI-driven decisions taken in a Spanish bank. She was being charged some commissions on her account which according to bank rules were not applicable in this account. She went to a branch to get those removed and dis-charged. The person attending her agreed that she was right but when she tried, the AI algorithms didn’t allow to remove the commission because some obscure “original sin”, let’s call it this way, coming from the merger of the original bank where the account had been opened long ago. In the end this has been solved by a helping attendant who decided that the only way to do this was to deceive the algorithm with false data. You can imagine where is this all going when you have to resort to tricks. Sounds like a great way to have a crooked bank employee feed the AI algorithm some dodgy data so that bank funds are sent to an account that may not be “officially” listed. Would banks miss money going into a bank account that they cannot find listed in their files or even know about? That sounds a lot like the begging process that medical professionals face, with insurance company “care approval” protocols. There is no shortage of stories about doctors and patients trying to get timely care coverage. Insurers claim cost savings and better care, but charts suggest otherwise. There is a thingy about this on the Netflix show Barry and is in real life the Australian Robo Debt debacle – https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-04/robodebt-victims-get-compensation-from-class-action/105734030 I mean its not like there is some decades of these machinations in the “Market Place” and some are still confused … HR is old hat now lmmao … This is a tangent, but bear with me – it’s good and kinda relevant. The last link in the article is to a Science News Today article about building a “Dyson Sphere.” The article states: Dyson’s idea was born out of a need to conceptualize how an advanced civilization could continue to thrive as it consumed more and more energy. This is fake news (and a very common misconception). Freeman Dyson was making fun of the tortured logic used by SETI scientists to explain why they thought looking for particular radio waves would be a reasonable way to scan the stars for life. The article in which Dyson proposed the sphere was a one-page parody letter to an astro-physics journal. Unfortunately, a lot of people don’t get dry humor (which is extremely obvious when you read the actual ‘paper’) and took him seriously. Dyson himself thought it was funny that he was best known for a joke he made instead of any of the actual physics he did. At any rate, the fact that a science news website is acting like Dyson Spheres make any sense at all (they don’t, and purposely so) is pretty indicative of where we’re at as a society…i.e. pretty far down the path to Idiocracy. So the guy bringing us GenAI talking about building Dyson Spheres is pretty on-brand. The best part of Altman’s quote got cut out in the article, however. Right after mentioning Dyson spheres, he says, “Like probably in the next 10 years or something.” roflmao. IBM TV ad on streaming: “Blue gonna help you transform your business with AI.” Reminds me of the TQM craze, everyone chased it no one read Deming! It’s doing wonders for their stock price, though. Victory! Why does this whole sorry episode remind me of the Biblical story of The Tower of Babel? It will all end in tears … As of last night, it finally dawned on me that I’ve been noticing what must be AI generated text in the description feeds to my Amazon Prime video account feeds. The first one I saw, but didn’t recognize it at the time as an AI hallucination, was a movie with the description that started something like, “Set in the 1920’s…”. However watching the trailer it was obvious the story was more modern, but the one item that probably threw me was there was one brief photo in the trailer that was older – maybe from the 1920’s. Anyhow I was confused enough by it that I just kept skipping it. Then last night I watch “The Healer”. It’s intro text started something like, “From the 17th century…” but again the trailer was all modern. I mentally just assumed the 17th century was a reference to a family history of healers which was part of the story line (that it was a family thing). However, after watching it there is NEVER any mention of anything from the 17th century. Then it dawned on me that it might be an AI hallucination. When I even went to the Amazon website the descriptive text there for “The Healer” never said anything about the 17th century, it was only in my Amazon Prime feed from the app on my Android TV. I am now certain my confusion over the “Set in the 1920’s” is also a hallucination. For all your readers who are interested in the history of AI’s coming into being in its current form Matteo Pasquinelli’s book, ‘The Eye of the Master: a social history of Artificial Intelligence’ is indepensable. It chartes the battles of the neuroscience sector, the interests of the US navy and Marxist analysis of labour power with formidable argument to demonstrate the deep flaws in AI’s claims to triumphant revolution. Well, with AI replacing labor, AI robotics replacing labor, AI replacing thinking … AI replacing….. with AI getting all the money to be productive while actual humans have income while that income is depleted more and more by out-go. You would think that fewer and fewer people will be able to afford the purchase or consumption of these magical AI fantasies. I guess if humans are to be digitized to the point of no choice, well then, AI will have all the biological imput devices for it’s consumption and outputs designed to maximize profits I am waiting for AI to come of age in law and take over for lawyers and judges. Between the constant stories of AI hallucinations re: legal case, and anecdotes about AIs learning to “cheat,” I can only imagine what sort of dystopic Wild West is coming for the court system… “The disappointing rollout of ChatGPT-5 raises doubts about OpenAI’s ability to build and market consumer products that users are willing to pay for. But the point I want to make is not just about OpenAI: the American AI industry as a whole has been built on the premise that AGI is just around the corner. All that is needed is sufficient “compute”, i.e., millions of Nvidia AI GPUs, enough data centers and sufficient cheap electricity to do the massive statistical pattern mapping needed to generate (a semblance of) “intelligence”. This, in turn, means that “scaling” (investing billions of U.S. dollars in chips and data centers) is the one-and-only way forward — and this is exactly what the tech firms, Silicon Valley venture capitalists and Wall Street financiers are good at: mobilizing and spending funds, this time for “scaling-up” generative AI and building data centers to support all the expected future demand for AI use.” The disappointing performance of the COVID-19 vaccines raises doubts about Biomedicine’s ability to read and understand the scientific literature, which has demonstrated conclusively that durable immunity to coronaviruses is unattainable in vertebrates, either through previous infection or vaccination. Nevertheless, Operation Warp Speed was built on the premise that after everyone was vaccinated the pandemic would recede into nothingness. Cost was no object, and a few transnational Big Pharma corporations made tens of billions of dollars during 2021 and 2022, with the expectation of a continuing money stream after the initial surge in vaccinations. This approach was the only way forward and would lead to a revolution in rapid responses to future emerging infectious diseases using mRNA vaccines. And the scientists who figured out how to stabilize expression of exogenous mRNA in the target cells and tissues were awarded a Nobel Prize for their previously underappreciated research. Some calm reflection is in order. If all progress in AI development stopped cold today, it would take 20 years for its benefits to percolate through the world economy. Note that the productivity potential of networked computer technology and uniform electronic data standards available 20 years ago has still not been achieved, largely because of institutional behavioral inertia. The gating factor in the application of intelligence to the problems of man is not the pace of the synthesis of intelligence, it is the unwillingness of mankind to behave intelligently in accepting change. We know how to make universal medical charts and records. We know how to fully automate air traffic control. We know how to prevent train collisions. We know how to build trusted voting systems. But we are good at finding reasons for not doing the things we say we want to accomplish. Of course, when something becomes an “emergency,” suddenly the obvious is discovered. Welcome to the modern world: powered by emergencies, not emergent technologies. It ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things. — Niccolò Machiavelli This IS calm reflection, and not a moment too soon, in the face of too much cult-like marketing hype. Who is this “we” that will harness technology for the good of mankind? If recent history has shown us anything at all, it is that the application of new technologies—at least in the Western world—will be controlled by the most ruthlessly exploitive financial interests and used primarily if not exclusively to extract value from everyone else. This is the opposite of broadbased dissemination and learning that filters into quality improvements across sectors, raising living standards. My sister is a nurse. I’ve heard quite a bit about the rollout and aftermath of the EPIC medical management system. It is not designed to help medical providers or improve patient care. It’s about billing, full stop, and it’s hated by pretty much everyone she knows in her field. “We know how to make universal medical charts and records.” Yes, we do. And they have very little to do with improving healthcare and everything to do with billing and upcoding. No single $8-ibuprofen tablet shall remain unaccounted for! It is also true that AI transcribed charts are often replete with mistranslations and outright hallucinations. It is a sad fact that U.S. hospitals have effectively resisted the automation and interoperability of their systems for decades. Medical professionals have insisted on preserving institutional moats and drawbridges that render their computer systems highly incompatible, despite the obvious need to track the same patient information. There is no digital standard for the patient chart, the most basic medical record. Between 5 to 10 percent of patients are harmed by medical error. Surely uniform AI cross checks on diagnosis and treatment would reduce that. Put on top of this a health insurance structure that only M.C. Escher could depict, and you have an inefficient mess attributable not to evil computer geniuses, but to institutional turf wars, perverse incentives, and just plain cussedness. It’s not just medical institutions. Look at the power grid, the rail system, pipeline infrastructure, and air traffic control. Look at the inability to build housing, the plague of homeless mentally ill people, all in a nation that is among the richest in the world. Is misguided technology speculation really a central problem? Is misguided technology speculation [that will probably crash a debt-ridden economy] really a central problem? It sounds bad to me… Private Debt mate “Is misguided technology speculation really a central problem?” It’s certainly not the solution. Most of this is due to the category error that his health insurance. People insure their lives and property against events that are unlikely. Illness and accident are not in this category. No argument from me that if healthcare were the objective instead of private profit (even in “nonprofit” hospitals), interoperability and legitimate electronic health records could be useful and universal and improve healthcare all around. According to STAT yesterday, UpToDate is unveiling its AI version. UpToDate has become the near universal cheat sheet for clinicians. Still, from the article: That kind of explainability is critical as doctors choose when and how to let different AI tools help them, said Crowe. But healthcare AI experts emphasized that those advances have not eliminated the chance for error through hallucinations, omissions, or other more nuanced LLM mistakes. Stanford’s Chen cited an example in which a resident had treated a patient with severe alcohol withdrawal with phenobarbital, a powerful sedative and anticonvulsant, based on an LLM-based tool’s response. Chen asked the AI the same question, and got the response he expected: First line therapy was safer benzodiazepines, followed by phenobarbital. “AI will just make up some stuff — or even if it doesn’t make up stuff, it’s a little bit random,” he said. “This unpredictability is what allows it to be kind of creative and flexible. But do you want to be creative when you’re practicing medicine?” Some clinical generative AI tools may perform better than others — depending on their engineering, the data they’re trained on, or their underlying LLMs. There are tradeoffs involved in choosing any subset of medical material to train on. “You are potentially missing some important information if you’re not pulling from more up-to-date resources,” said physician Cornelius James, who researches AI and evidence-based medicine at the University of Michigan. “But you also avoid bias in that you’re not pulling from some of those more up-to-date resources.” But clinicians are missing the details needed to make informed choices between tools. “The general state of the evidence is terrible,” said neurosurgeon Eric Oermann, who directs the Health AI Research Lab at NYU Langone. Researchers and companies are developing benchmarks that evaluate an LLM’s medical abilities, from simple early versions like taking the U.S. medical licensing exam to those involving real-world patient tasks and clinical reasoning. Benchmarks are imperfect, said Oermann, but at least they allow for researchers to compare large language models from tech companies like Google and OpenAI on a level playing field by peppering their APIs with thousands of programmed questions. Anyway, I do not think it unreasonable to expect a resident physician to know that benzodiazepines are the preferred choice over phenobarbital for a patient suffering from alcohol withdrawal, which is not a particularly rare condition. It has been said millions times that “being educated means knowing where to look up something.” No, being educated means knowing what you know and what you don’t know. Researchers and companies are developing benchmarks that evaluate an LLM’s medical abilities, from simple early versions like taking the U.S. medical licensing exam to those involving real-world patient tasks and clinical reasoning. GingerBalls on the Twitter often points out that there’s an unintelligent solution to every intelligence test, so passing these licensing exams is meaningless. Participation in the technical aspects of this discussion, which I am reading with great interest, is above my pay grade, but an observation: the medical and pharmaceutical professions, at least in Canada, are currently the sole remaining market for fax machines. You clearly have not been paying attention to our decade+ posting, based on the work of medical professionals who happen to be experts in IT, as well as the experience of users, that electronic health records are an utter train wreck. And it has NADA to do with your bogus depiction. The process has been driven by billing and the desire to upcode. Not medical care. Not ever remotely your fabricated “medical professionals preserving institutional moats’. You need to stop Making Shit Up when you do not know what you are talking about. Agree with everything here except timing. Some economists tried to quantify the technology diffusion rate and found it’s closer to fifty years instead of twenty if you’re looking at full global adoption. Smartphones took over the world and changed our brains in less than ten years, on the other hand. But yes, there are still Homo sap tribes living in the Amazon who don’t know the world outside their forest and are living the way they lived in 20,000 years (though not in the Americas). Personally, I think it’ll be a sad day if and when they cease to be there — because the world is coming for them — though I wouldn’t wish to be one of them. “Yet AI, which Storm calls “Artificial Information” … Perfect. Re: The AI Bubble and the U.S. Economy: How Long Do “Hallucinations” Last? By Servaas Storm Proper descriptive language is critical to the analysis and reworking of human systems. Therefore, being lulled into repeating truisms that are not true undermines the work being undertaken. In the article, Storm says, “The AI investment boom is based on the belief that AI will make workers and firms significantly more productive, which will in turn boost corporate profits to unprecedented levels.” That phrase is not true. Eliminating “workers and” corrects the statement, ironically, by doing exactly what makes AI so attractive to “firms.” The idea that automation makes the residual workforce more productive has always been a lie, a lie that has been encouraged by ownership simply because it has some ability to make that residual workforce proud of the machines that make it “the most productive workforce in human history,” even as the latest machines pick off the remaining laborers, one by one. Dividing amount of production by number of laborers to get ever-rising labor productivity figures is a stupid accounting trick. Dividing production by labor equivalent units (LEU’s – and, yes, this is adapted from containerized shipping) gives away the game. By not defining or measuring LEU’s, it veils the possibility that productivity – given that energy and pollution would necessarily be figured into the cost of each LEU – would be revealed as having heretofore invisible periods of stagnation, even regression. More importantly, defining and measuring LEU’s would eliminate any last trace of simplistically attributing productivity to labor. By dividing measured production between labor and LEU’s, it would make stark the reality that ownership always trumps attribution. Attributed productivity has never given more than a tenuous claim to the profits of production. Labor has always known that. Labor has long been able to project the trend of increasing productivity and has long dreaded that projection: that eventually “labor” would be reduced to a janitor cleaning up after the machines, working for minimum wage, while being attributed trillions in productivity. Ownership matters. Once nourishment and a safe place to live is secured, ideas are the most valuable commodities, yet “intellectual property” is almost an oxymoron. Technique ends up embedded in tools. That is why, where the guilds were strong, possessing the tools of a craftsman, without being a member of the appropriate guild might actually be a crime. Similarly, the Luddites were not so much opposed to advances in technology as they were the embedding of their intellectual property into an array of machines. Truly, the machinists were the first computer programers, and they feasted on converting the deep skills of others into own-able hardware. Now, the programmers are coming for the artists, the scientists, even the C-suites, and the latest generation of programmers might be the last, as intellectual property devours its producers, and is left to eat its own tail. But the last programmer will be attributed a vast productivity. “Eric Schmidt and Selina Xuworry, in the New York Times of August 19, 2025, that “Silicon Valley has grown so enamored with accomplishing this goal [of AGI] that it’s alienating the general public and, worse, bypassing crucial opportunities to use the technology that already exists. In being solely fixated on this objective, our nation risks falling behind China, which is far less concerned with creating A.I. powerful enough to surpass humans and much more focused on using the technology we have now.” That’s some Chinese characteristics that I endorse. The USA business and financial sector is preoccupied with trying to insert rent-seeking middle-men between all the issues that could be addressed now – for and by people in the here and now. The people who have to be healthy, sane, and safe in order to have healthy, sane, and safe people in the future. It’s still just fucking software! What a con! If you are interested in a detailed outline of the progress of AI in the MIC, here is a great substack that explains what is going on in the field where military combat AI is being developed. It focuses on Arizona and New Mexico because the largest combat military training centers in the world are located there. I foresee a great future for AI as the military has unlimited financing for the large corporations dabbing in that field. https://sonoransown.substack.com/p/life-recast I guess this is the terminal phase of the AI bubble, the phase I remember from the dotcom one – if you mention the risks that were mounting by the hour people would yell at you because the objective was to get funding and walk away with all you could in the crash. And in five years somebody buys the infrastructure for pennies on the dollar and turns a profit on porn or whatever. Only a tiny example of odd experience: I was testing duck.ai as my system is too old to host the new programs. I wanted duck.ai to shorten a narrative text by 10, then 20, then 50%. For some internal error it cut it down by 90%, 80% and 50% respectively. This failure repeated. It never came up with versions which would be 10% shorter or 20% than what I had fed it with. Strange. Generally the results with narrative fiction are horrible. What the system is offering (they claim to treat the texts confidential) is either total nonsense or equipped with some sense but solely by coincidence. Containing meaning that has little to do with what I had originally written. This is especially true – and now any programmer should seriously lsiten up – humour or “poetical” formulations. Style in general is overwhelming it. Anything where “tonality” comes into play crashes it . As I said I can´t judge state of the art systems. But unless I tell any AI to reproduce something in the style of say TS Eliot, or Dickens or Austen, it doesn´t know wha to do. It is totally lost and will fail to develope inherent styles of its own. And produce gibberish. Which shouldn´t surprise. At the beginning of the industrial revolution, workers rebelled against the machines. They intuited that if they did not own the machines, the machines would own them. This is also the case with robotics in production, “Who owns the robots?” AI in my thinking is no more than a language and data collecting robot. So, “who owns AI?” We see that financialization and rent-seeking have turned AI research into a mess. By all accounts, researchers in China do not do the same. #DotComBoomBustMemories I had a video chat with one of my younger colleagues at work, and they asked me what similarities if any I see between the dot-com-boom, and this new AI-boom. At first, I thought that the dot-com-boom was really more intense flying-by-the-seat-of-ones-pants-into-the-unknown … but as we talked through it, I realized, that this is potentially far worse. The lemmings from lower Manhattan and the sycophants from the valley of silicon are getting the band back together! Rare moment of clarity from Eric Schmidt there … he’s already made his billions, though, so I can imagine some of the young guns who are lookin’ to get theirs scoffing at his concern. Once again, the odious runaway sewage train (via YouTube) of unicorn valuations looks set to derail and spill sh** everywhere. When the colo-business (via dgtlinfra.com) collapsed after the dot-com-bust, a lot of data-center space in NY/NJ, for example, reverted to office space. The intervening years brought public-cloud to the fore, and now public cloud space is set to expand just like metro datacenter space expanded at the turn of the century. One can only imagine the impact of large AI-specific datacenters being built out in the boonies (where land/tax, water and power are cheaper, ostensibly) only to have them decommissioned and empty when the bust invariably comes. Empty strip mall desert redux, anyone? One of the reasons the tech-bros are focused on “surpassing human intelligence” is because they absolutely loathe labor. The finance bros may seem convinced about AI, but they’re not fully. They want two things: • Proof that AI can generate new revenue streams – this, they have gotten thus far. • Proof that AI can kill jobs – this, they haven’t got (to a satisfactory degree yet), and I think this is what they really, really want. The dumb asses don’t understand how an economy works at all, and are blinded by the dollar signs in their eyes. So, yeah … bubble, bubble, toil and trouble! And if, by some chance, this edifice of irrational exuberance somehow manages to survive, just remember: AI is gonna replace everyone … except VC’s … #natch (via futurism.com). Rare moment of clarity from Eric Schmidt there … he’s already made his billions, though, so I can imagine some of the young guns who are lookin’ to get theirs scoffing at his concern. I don’t have to imagine. I’ve heard them. > I don’t have to imagine. I’ve heard them. Thanks much for the confirmation! I know these types, but don’t share environs often. Sadly, the article did NOT look at AI in China – but was navel-focused. China AI is primarily focused on the factory, where it actually provides quantifiable cost savings. The US AI has been focused on rendering a larger fraction of the population as inessential workers – to use the language of Bender in Futurama – meatbags – consistent with the disdain the oligarchs have for the lumpen population. Karma when the bubble bursts? Computers are supposed to compute. That is their utility 2+2=4,every time maybe boring, but that is all there is. Your email address will not be published.

According to a Bloomberg report, the secondary sale lets current and former staff who had held shares for at least two years sell stock to a handful of companies, including Thrive Capital, SoftBank Group, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi’s MGX, and T. Rowe Price. The deal marks OpenAI’s second major tender offer in under a year, following a $1.5 billion SoftBank transaction last November. In January, the Japanese conglomerate was reportedly in talks to earmark up to $25 billion for OpenAI. SoftBank’s U.S.-traded shares (SFTBY) rose 1.7% to $66.04 on Thursday after news of the OpenAI share sale, reflecting investor enthusiasm for its AI-linked deals. The $500 billion figure reflects a steep rise for OpenAI from earlier in the year, when the ChatGPT developer was valued at $300 billion following a $40 billion funding round led by Softbank in March. With this latest move, the company now sits ahead of SpaceX—whose own valuation is estimated near $400 billion—putting OpenAI at the top of the private company universe. Despite scrutiny around the rollout of GPT-5, investor confidence remains undimmed. In September, OpenAI and Nvidia unveiled a strategic infrastructure partnership: OpenAI plans to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems, and Nvidia will invest up to $100 billion progressively as each gigawatt is deployed. Jensen Huang described it as part of “bringing AI infrastructure from the labs into the world.” It also coincides with the ongoing Stargate partnership between OpenAI, Softbank, and Oracle to build out America’s AI infrastructure backed by the Trump Administration. The sale also gives employees liquidity that could help the company fend off nine-figure pay packages from rivals such as Meta, which is aggressively hiring for its new Superintelligence Labs. The timing also coincides with structural moves at OpenAI. The company lifted its capped-profit limit in May, all the while facing continued legal pressure from Elon Musk. An OpenAI co-founder, Musk has sued the company on multiple occasions. Musk has accused OpenAI of abandoning its original nonprofit mission and allegedly attempting to steal xAI data and trade secrets.

OpenAI could now be the world’s most valuable startup, ahead of Elon Musk’s SpaceX and TikTok parent company ByteDance, after a secondary stock sale designed to retain employees at the ChatGPT maker OpenAI could now be the world's most valuable startup, ahead of Elon Musk's SpaceX and TikTok's parent company ByteDance, after a secondary stock sale designed to retain employees at the ChatGPT maker. Current and former OpenAI employees sold $6.6 billion in shares to a group of investors, pushing the privately held artificial intelligence company's valuation to $500 billion, according to a source with knowledge of the deal who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The investors buying the shares included Thrive Capital, Dragoneer Investment Group and T. Rowe Price, along with Japanese tech giant SoftBank and the United Arab Emirates' MGX, the source said Thursday. The valuation reflects high expectations for the future of AI technology and continues OpenAI’s remarkable trajectory from its start as a nonprofit research lab in 2015. But with the San Francisco-based company not yet turning a profit, it could also amplify concerns about an AI bubble if the generative AI products made by OpenAI and its competitors don't meet the expectations of investors pouring billions of dollars into research and development. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has sought to dismiss those concerns, most recently last week, when he toured a massive data center complex being built to run the company's AI systems in Abilene, Texas. “Between the ten years we’ve already been operating and the many decades ahead of us, there will be booms and busts,” Altman said after being asked about a bubble. “People will overinvest and lose money, and underinvest and lose a lot of revenue.” He added that “we’ll make some dumb capital allocations” and there will be short-term ups and downs but that "over the arc that we have to plan over, we are confident that this technology will drive a new wave of unprecedented economic growth,” along with scientific breakthroughs, improvements to quality of life and “new ways to express creativity.” Just this week, the company launched two different business ventures, one a partnership with Etsy and Shopify for online shopping through ChatGPT and another a social media app, Sora, for generating and sharing AI videos. OpenAI has been struggling to offer investors and staff the same perks and compensation as the publicly traded tech giants with which it competes. Facebook parent Meta Platforms, in particular, has been on a hiring spree for elite AI engineers and in June made a $14.3 billion investment in AI company Scale that recruited its CEO Alexandr Wang. OpenAI's for-profit subsidiary, valued at $500 billion, is technically controlled by the board of OpenAI’s nonprofit and both are still bound to pursue the nonprofit’s charitable purpose. OpenAI’s partnerships with major companies and its plans to change its corporate structure have drawn the scrutiny of regulators, including the attorneys general of California and Delaware, who oversee charitable organizations that operate or are incorporated in their states. The company has made big deals in recent weeks with Oracle and SoftBank, its partners on a data center venture called Stargate, and with chipmaker Nvidia, which makes the specialized AI chips those data centers need. At the same time, it has lessened its reliance on longtime backer Microsoft. In September, OpenAI announced it had reached a tentative agreement with Microsoft about the future stake of its nonprofit in its for-profit corporation but released few details. It also opened applications for nonprofits to apply for $50 million in funding from OpenAI, an effort it launched in response to the recommendations of an advisory board. The grants will go toward projects that increase public understanding of AI, support the design of AI for uses that communities want and increase economic opportunity.

Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) capitalized on Wall Street’s artificial intelligence boom Thursday, fueled by billions in chip investments from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and other technology giants. Broadcom has emerged as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the generative AI boom, carving out a strategic niche in the rapidly evolving chip market. While competitors like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) offer off-the-shelf, high-performance GPUs, Broadcom focuses on designing custom AI chips for its hyperscale customers, the tech giants that own and operate the world’s largest data centers. Also Read: Broadcom Wins $10 Billion OpenAI Order, Analyst Sees More Growth Ahead This approach allows companies like Microsoft, Meta, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to tailor silicon to their exact needs, offering a compelling, often less expensive, alternative to the pricier, general-purpose Nvidia chips. By helping these key players design their proprietary AI accelerators, Broadcom solidifies its foundational role in the sector, ensuring its technology is deeply integrated into the core infrastructure of the AI revolution. KeyBanc Capital Markets reinforced this outlook by reiterating its Overweight rating on Broadcom and raising its price forecast to $420 from $400, citing the company’s foundational position in AI and the broader semiconductor supply chain. Following recent channel checks, analyst John Vinh said that the supply chains of Nvidia and Broadcom “sound the best,” as upward revisions are coming to chip-on-a-wafer-substrate (CoWoS) supply. Broadcom’s trajectory as a core AI beneficiary is evident in its expanded targets. Its 2026 CoWoS supply goal has climbed to 190,000 units, reflecting an anticipated year-over-year increase exceeding 160%, Vinh noted. A critical factor in its AI dominance remains control over Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google TPU franchise through 2026, with volumes expected to more than double. Additionally, Broadcom has secured significant new AI ASIC orders, including 400,000-500,000 units for OpenAI and roughly 100,000 units for Apple, reinforcing its influence over AI development and production. Analyst John Vinh raised the price forecast to $420 based on $10.37 fiscal 2026 consolidated earnings per share (EPS). Price Action: AVGO stock was trading higher by 2.31% to $341.10 at last check Thursday. Read Next: Photo by Remus Rigo via Shutterstock © 2025 Benzinga.com.

By MATT O’BRIEN OpenAI could now be the world’s most valuable startup, ahead of Elon Musk’s SpaceX and TikTok’s parent company ByteDance, after a secondary stock sale designed to retain employees at the ChatGPT maker.

Title: OpenAI valuation reaches $500 billion, topping Musk’s SpaceX

Time Published: 2025-10-02T18:37:55Z
Full Content:
OpenAI has completed a deal to help employees sell shares in the company at a $500 billion valuation, propelling the ChatGPT owner past Elon Musk’s SpaceX to become the world’s largest startup. Current and former OpenAI employees sold about $6.6 billion of stock to investors including Thrive Capital, SoftBank Group Corp., Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi’s MGX and T. Rowe Price, a person familiar with the transaction said. That boosted the US company’s price tag well past its previous $300 billion level during a SoftBank-led financing round earlier this year. That rapid rise underscores the investment frenzy surrounding the leaders of a technology with the potential to transform industries and economies. Sam Altman’s OpenAI is one of several companies including Nvidia Corp. now leading a global push to build data centers and develop artificial intelligence services, an undertaking that’s expected to cost trillions of dollars. Though it has yet to turn a profit, the US startup is helping fuel that infrastructure boom by inking mega-sized deals with the likes of Oracle Corp. and SK Hynix Inc. Representatives for Thrive Capital and Dragoneer didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. OpenAI, SoftBank and T. Rowe Price spokespeople declined to comment. A spokesperson for MGX said the firm is “pleased to be a core partner to OpenAI and to continue building on our strong relationship as a significant investor across multiple funding rounds.” The deal vaults OpenAI past SpaceX’s $400 billion valuation. That milestone coincides with a pivotal time for Altman’s company, which is in negotiations with Microsoft Corp. to convert into a more traditional for-profit company. OpenAI was founded in 2015 as a nonprofit dedicated to advancing digital intelligence “in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole.” Planned changes will give the existing OpenAI nonprofit entity control over a new public benefit corporation. Both Altman and Musk, who were OpenAI co-founders, have spoken about the potential existential risk to humans posed by AI. Yet they’ve since fallen out: Musk has sued to try and stop the overhaul, accusing OpenAI of forsaking promises to him when he helped to create the nonprofit. He claims it abandoned its founding purpose when it accepted billions of dollars in backing from Microsoft starting in 2019, the year after he left OpenAI’s board. When it comes to the business itself, OpenAI faces an increasingly competitive market for AI talent as big tech firms jockey for the resources they need. Meta Platforms Inc., for one, has recruited researchers aggressively from OpenAI and other top labs for its new “superintelligence” team, offering pay packages in the nine-figure range. A secondary sale could help OpenAI incentivize staff to stay at the company and turn down those lavish compensation offers. Major US startups often negotiate share sales for their employees as a way to reward and retain staff, and also attract external investors. OpenAI is looking to leverage investor demand to provide employees with liquidity that reflects the company’s growth. The value of a company tied to a secondary share sale is separate from the traditional private market valuation set when a startup completes a new round of funding. The total amount of eligible units sold in the secondary fell short of the $10 billion-plus worth of stock that the company allowed for sale, the person familiar said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the information is private. That could mean current and former employees are demonstrating confidence in the long-term viability of the business, the person added. In the long run, OpenAI faces mounting competitive pressure from rivals such as Google and Anthropic, which is also raising capital at a rapid clip. In response, OpenAI has embarked on a spate of recent technology product launches. Those include a pair of open and freely available artificial intelligence models that can mimic the human process of reasoning, months after China’s DeepSeek gained global attention with its own open software. OpenAI released its most powerful GPT-5 model in August, aimed at shoring up its lead in an increasingly crowded sphere. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

The world's richest man just got richer. Elon Musk became the first person with a net worth of $500 billion in October 2025, according to Forbes. Rising Tesla shares fueled this jump in Musk's fortune. The company's stock was up nearly 17% year-to-date as of Oct. 2, 2025. Musk's wealth has been in the news for a proposed new pay package that could make him a trillionaire. Tesla (TSLA) is asking its investors to approve a massive pay package for Musk which would be valued at nearly $1 trillion if he can lead the company to achieve certain valuation and operations milestones over the next 10 years, according to a recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing. Shareholders are set to vote on this pay package in November. Musk's net worth is largely driven by his stakes in Tesla and privately held rocket and satellite manufacturing company, SpaceX. The additional shares under the new pay deal could push the value of Musk-owned Tesla shares to over $2 trillion. Tesla's share price increased more than 60% in 2024, with some of those gains coming after President Trump won the election in November. An insider share sale of SpaceX in December 2024 also boosted Musk's net worth by about $50 billion, according to Bloomberg. Musk's wealth surpasses other notable billionaires including Amazon.com (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, Meta's (META) Mark Zuckerberg, and Oracle's (ORCL) Larry Ellison according to Forbes and Bloomberg. Here's how the Tesla CEO made his billions. esla is one of the largest carmakers in the world. The company builds and designs fully electric vehicles and also makes energy generation and storage products like solar panels, solar roof tiles, and battery systems. Its vehicles include sedans, mid-size SUVs and the CyberTruck. Tesla was founded in 2003 as Tesla Motors by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Musk invested in the company and was a member of the board starting in 2004. He became CEO in 2008. Musk was allowed to claim the title of cofounder after an out-of-court settlement. Tesla went public in an initial public offering (IPO) on June 29, 2010. In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from its native Palo Alto, Calif., to Austin, Texas. In July 2023, Tesla unveiled its first Cybertruck built in its Texas factory, almost two years behind the original schedule. Musk is Tesla's largest shareholder, and owns 19.7% of the company's stock as of August 29, 2025. Musk is also the cofounder and CEO of SpaceX, a rocket manufacturing company that counts NASA as a client and helps resupply the International Space Station. SpaceX became the most valuable startup in the world when it considered raising funds at a $400 billion valuation in July 2025, according to Bloomberg. Musk owns 42% of SpaceX, which has launched over 400 rockets since it was founded in 2002, and has more than 4 million subscribers for its Starlink internet service. In April 2022, Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion after threatening a hostile takeover. The deal was finalized in October 2022 after Twitter sued Musk for trying to back out of the deal. His takeover has been controversial, as he laid off much of the company’s workforce and added a paid subscription service ($8 per month) for anyone who wants their account verified. In July 2023, Musk rebranded Twitter as X, replacing the blue bird logo with the letter. Fidelity estimates that X is worth about $9.4 billion, according to Forbes, per disclosures released by the investment firm in September 2024. Fidelity's stake in X is now worth about $4.19 million, down about 79% before Musk bought X. Musk founded artificial intelligence firm xAI in 2023. In July 2025, the company was looking to raise fund from investors that would peg its valuation up to $200 billion, according to the Financial Times. The company also raised $10 billion vis loans and cash investments in June, following a $300 million share sale in July, the Financial Times reported. Musk owns about 54% of xAI, per Forbes. The team at xAI is led by Musk and others who have previously worked with OpenAI, DeepMind, Google Research, Microsoft Research, and Tesla. Musk is also the founder of The Boring Company, a construction company that aims to “solve traffic” by building tunnels. The company raised $675 million in April 2022 at a valuation of $5.7 billion, according to a release. Musk co-founded a company called Neuralink which designed a "brain-computer interface," a chip that can be implanted into the brain and would allow users to control their computers and mobile devices with their thoughts. According to the company's website, Neuralink is working to help those with quadriplegia, a symptom of paralysis that affects a person's limbs and body from the neck down, with the ability to control their devices with their thoughts. The company, which launched its first human trial in January 2024, was valued at an estimated $9 billion, after a raising $600 million earlier this year according to Semafor.

OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has reached a valuation of $500 billion, following a deal in which current and former employees sold roughly $6.6 billion worth of shares, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. This represents a bump-up from its current valuation of $300 billion, underscoring OpenAI’s rapid gains in both users and revenue. Reuters reported details of the stock sale earlier in August. As part of the deal, OpenAI employees sold shares to a consortium of investors including Thrive Capital, SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi’s MGX and T. Rowe Price, according to the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the media. The company had authorized sales of $10-billion-plus worth of stock on the secondary market, the source added. Thrive Capital, SoftBank, Dragoneer, MGX and T. Rowe Price did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. The share sale adds to SoftBank’s earlier investment in OpenAI’s $40 billion primary funding round. The company generated around $4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025, about 16% more than it generated all of last year, the Information reported earlier this week. The sale comes at a time when tech giants are competing aggressively for AI talent with lucrative compensation packages. Meta is notably investing billions in Scale AI and poached its 28-year-old CEO, Alexandr Wang, to lead its new super intelligence unit.

OpenAI has reportedly finalized a secondary share sale that values the artificial intelligence company at $500 billion, making the ChatGPT owner the world's most valuable startup ever. The share sale, which allows employees to cash out, comes just months after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that Meta Platforms (META) was poaching the company's AI staff with signing bonuses as high as $100 million. OpenAI's sky-high valuation suggests investor demand for AI plays, which has helped propel the major U.S. equities indexes to record highs, remains strong. According to Bloomberg, OpenAI's current and former employees sold about $6.6 billion in stock in a deal that has has vaulted the company past Elon Musk’s SpaceX to become the world’s largest startup. OpenAI had a $300 billion valuation earlier this year. Rocket company SpaceX is valued at $400 billion, Bloomberg said. Investors that bought into the secondary share sale—where investors buy from other investors rather than the company—included Japan's SoftBank, which put forth $30 billion in a funding round earlier this year. Thrive Capital, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi’s MGX, and T. Rowe Price also snapped up shares, the report said. OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft (MSFT), is the latest of a string of AI startups to have seen valuations soar as investors are eager for exposure ahead of potential market entries. Nvidia (NVDA) also said last month that it plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI to build out AI data centers. Nvidia, the chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom, has a market capitalization of well over $4 trillion, making it the world's most valuable publicly listed company. OpenAI didn't immediately respond to an Investopedia request for comment.

The sale pushed OpenAI’s total valuation to $500 billion, the highest ever achieved by a privately held company. Purchasers included SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group, Thrive Capital, MGX, and T. Rowe Price, the report said. The sale was not a conventional funding round, as the cash went to individuals holding shares or options in OpenAI rather than the company’s own coffers. Still, it’s a powerful retention tool for the company, which has faced significant pressure from Meta’s newly revitalized AI lab. This summer, Meta poached at least seven top engineers from OpenAI, often luring them away with multimillion-dollar signing bonuses. OpenAI’s most recent funding round came in August, when it completed a $40 billion fundraise at a $300 billion valuation. SoftBank, Thrive, T. Rowe Price, and Dragoneer were also investors in that round, as well as private equity firms like Blackstone and TPG, and major venture capitalists like Founders Fund, Sequoia Capital, and Andreessen Horowitz. The sale is also a reminder of OpenAI’s ability to raise cash as needed — a particularly important resource given the company’s ambitious infrastructure plans. OpenAI has committed to spending $300 billion on Oracle Cloud Services over the next five years, a sum that vastly outstrips its current revenue or reserves. However, the powerful momentum of the company’s fundraising suggests it’s not as outlandish as standard arithmetic would indicate. In September, Nvidia announced a plan to invest $100 billion in OpenAI as part of a strategic infrastructure partnership. The new sale comes just weeks after a non-binding agreement between OpenAI and Microsoft, which many saw as paving the way for OpenAI’s conversion into a for-profit entity. But OpenAI’s conversion has not yet been confirmed in court, and the new sales could cause significant complications if the conversion fails to proceed as planned. OpenAI continues to develop and launch products at a blistering pace, releasing its latest Sora 2 video model and accompanying social media feed earlier this week. The company reported $4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025, while burning through $2.5 billion in cash.

It seems like it's AI or nothing. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The explosion of generative AI over the last few years signals a change in the job market alongside it, and this brings with it worries of job instability and losses. With big players like Nvidia, Meta, X, and the governments worldwide further committing to AI, questions are posed to those at the very top. In a recent interview with the British news channel, Channel 4, Nvidia's CEO Jensun Huang, gave his thoughts on what's next. He says, "If you're an electrician, if you're a plumber, if you're a carpenter, we're going to need hundreds of thousands of them. To build all of these factories." Huang argues, "The skilled craft segment of every economy is going to boom". "You're going to have to build. You're going to keep doubling and doubling… every single year." Just last week, Nvidia shared plans to spend $100 billion on OpenAI. This cash is intended to go towards greater supplies of data centre chips, to further train upcoming AI models. Just weeks before that, Nvidia's earnings report showed it made almost 10 times more from AI than gaming. Nvidia's stock price is also at an all-time high, over 10 times what it was half a decade ago. CEO of US chip giant Nvidia, Jensen Huang, tells Channel 4 News, that ‘electricians and plumbers’ will be the big winners in the AI race as the skilled craft segment of every economy is going to see a 'boom'. #Tech #AI #Nvidia #Economy #C4News OpenAI's spending has also skyrocketed, alongside ChatGPT's popularity, and the US government is firmly behind cementing "US dominance in artificial intelligence". From a PC gaming perspective, we've even seen brands like Razer jump on the AI bandwagon. This is all to say AI doesn't appear to be going away, and it has backing in the hundreds of billions. When asked what could happen if the UK doesn't 'grasp this opportunity', Huang says, "just as the last industrial revolution, the reason why it came about was because you needed it. And so the industrial revolution that started here in the UK came out of need. You need it now, too." Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Earlier this year, the UK's Department for Science, Innovation and Technology signed an agreement with OpenAI to push the chatbot into the public sector in a further bid to make the UK an AI powerhouse. Though highlighting future employment seems relevant to current fears around the job market, this doesn't address those who have degrees and experience in fields being replaced. Senator Bernie Sanders argued in June that "Artificial intelligence is going to displace millions and millions of workers". A month after this, OpenAI's Sam Altman shared that he thinks some jobs will be "totally, totally gone" due to AI. A former Google executive in August argued AI will lead to a "short-term dystopia" because it will struggle to create new jobs for those it is replacing. Huang tells reporters, "You're going to be building out AI infrastructure here in the UK for a decade," but it's not clear what the plan is for workers after that. 1.

Title: ChatGPT Shopping: How to Get AI to Recommend Your Products

Time Published: 2025-10-02T14:05:17Z
Full Content:
A 14-day trial for premium features. 55+ tools.Free access for core features. Backlinko readers getaccess for 14 days. 55+ tools. Written by Yongi Barnard ChatGPT recommends products — complete with photos, pricing, and purchase links — to its 700 million weekly users. And now customers can complete purchases without leaving the chat. BIG deal. But will ChatGPT recommend your products? That’s not automatic. And you can’t pay for placement. What you can do is optimize your site so ChatGPT understands what you sell, trusts your brand, and surfaces your products when buyers search. This guide shows you how. You’ll learn the eight-step framework for getting featured in ChatGPT Shopping. I also spoke with Leigh McKenzie, Backlinko’s Head of Growth and founder of the ecommerce brand UnderFit, to get his insights on what’s actually working. First, let’s look at how ChatGPT decides which products make the cut. ChatGPT Shopping kicks in automatically for some shopping intent prompts. While it doesn’t fire every time, I found it appears more often than not after testing 100+ prompts. The key? Typing a prompt with clear buying intent. Like “e-bikes that can handle potholes.” Instead of just explaining things or offering advice, ChatGPT Shopping recommends specific products. This includes product images, pricing, and links to online stores and websites where users can make a purchase. Side note: The ChatGPT Shopping experience isn’t consistent. Even with the same prompt, the carousel may (or may not) show. It can also appear at the top, middle, or bottom of the chat. This variability suggests the feature is still evolving. If your store gets recommended, countless high-intent shoppers will see your products. For example, when I tested the e-bike query, ChatGPT gave me a brief explanation of what features to prioritize. But it also provided a visual product carousel with eight products, each in its own card with key details. (It looks similar to Google Shopping ads, except you don’t have to pay for them.) Clicking on any card opens a side panel with: From there, users simply click “Visit” to reach the merchant’s product page. But this experience is changing. As of September 2025, OpenAI is rolling out Instant Checkout — a feature that lets shoppers buy directly inside ChatGPT. This is a huge shift. ChatGPT is no longer just a product discovery tool. It’s a full shopping destination. Right now, Instant Checkout is only available to Etsy sellers in the United States. But OpenAI plans to expand this feature to Shopify merchants and other countries soon. Not on either platform? They’re also accepting applications for merchants to build their own integrations. (More on this in Step #7.) A shopper describes what they’re looking for (“running shoes with arch support under $150”), and ChatGPT’s AI goes to work. It scans the web for the most relevant products based on that request. And weighs details like product names, descriptions, features, reviews, brand authority, and other signals to find the best matches. If your product checks the right boxes — and the information on your site is clear and crawlable — it has a chance to be recommended. ChatGPT may also consider the user’s location and preferences when making recommendations. Ultimately, all product recommendations must also pass through OpenAI’s safety systems. This filters out low-quality, misleading, or unsafe products. So, what does all of this mean for you? ChatGPT Shopping is evolving fast — and the brands that keep up will win the most visibility. Here’s how to ensure ChatGPT can understand, trust, and recommend your products. ChatGPT needs structured data to understand what you sell. Schema markup is code that labels key details on your product pages (and website as a whole): name, price, description, availability, reviews, and more. It turns raw HTML into data AI tools can parse instantly. Without it, ChatGPT (and other AI systems) have to guess what’s on your page. With it, they see clean, structured information they can confidently include in product recommendations. At a minimum, your product schema should include: It may look intimidating, but many content management systems — like WordPress, Shopify, and Wix — offer plugins or built-in tools that generate the markup for you automatically. Once your markup is in place, test that it’s working correctly using Google’s Rich Results Test or Schema.org’s validator. These tools make it easy to check that your structured data is valid, visible, and error-free. Pro tip: Go beyond the schema basics. Add AggregateRating for average review scores or FAQPage markup to answer common buyer questions. The more context you provide, the easier it is for AI to surface your product in response to specific prompts. A product feed is a structured file that packages up your product details and sends them to platforms like Google Merchant Center, Shopify, and Etsy. It includes details like titles, prices, availability, images, links, and more. ChatGPT may use data from major platforms like Google to decide which products to recommend. Pro tip: Want to add your product feed directly to ChatGPT? OpenAI will notify interested merchants when this feature is available. Fill out the Merchant Application form for consideration. For example, if your Google Shopping feed is outdated, incomplete, or inaccurate, ChatGPT may return bad information about your products. Or skip recommending them entirely. That’s why a high-quality, up-to-date product feed is critical. Side note: If you’re on an ecommerce platform like WooCommerce or Shopify, feeds are usually created automatically. But keeping feeds accurate is easier said than done. There are a lot of moving parts, like site updates, refresh schedules, and third-party tools. And it only takes one slip for mismatches to creep in. Here are a few common product feed issues — and how to fix them: Automation keeps most updates in sync. And manual checks before major launches or sales help catch anything that may slip through. Here’s how Leigh maintains a balance of the two for his ecommerce store: “I keep all my product data in a spreadsheet. Whenever I change a product detail, I update it there first. WooCommerce uses that data to update my site’s pages and schema automatically. Then, Channable takes the same spreadsheet and syncs those updates into my product feeds. That way, my site and my feeds are always pulling from the same source, so everything stays consistent.” If ChatGPT can’t read your site, it can’t recommend your products. Two simple technical issues block many ecommerce sites from showing up: hidden content and restricted crawlers. Many AI bots — including ChatGPT — still struggle with content that only loads via JavaScript. If key details aren’t in the page’s raw HTML, the bot might never see them. This includes your product descriptions, prices, and images. Eek. Here’s how to check if that’s happening: If your product details disappear, it means they’re only loading through JavaScript. To fix this, work with a developer to ensure all essential information is in your site’s raw HTML. Your robots.txt file can also block AI crawlers. This small file tells bots which parts of your site they can (and can’t) crawl. By default, most sites already allow all bots, including ChatGPT’s crawler, OAI-SearchBot. But it’s still worth double-checking. Here’s how: First, go to yourdomain.com/robots.txt. Then, look for a rule like this: And this: If it says “Disallow,” then ChatGPT is unable to crawl your site. You (or your dev team) can fix this issue by changing it to “allow.” Further reading: 23 Best Large Language Models ChatGPT matches products to prompts by language, not keywords. So, if your product copy doesn’t sound like the way people talk, it may not surface in shopping results. The goal: write the way buyers phrase their prompts. You don’t have to guess how your customers talk. Use research tools like: Look for modifiers that mimic real queries — terms like “best,” “for beginners,” “eco-friendly,” or “kid-friendly.” Tools like Semrush’s AI SEO Toolkit show you the actual prompts people type into AI engines. So, instead of manually guessing or testing one by one, you get a ready-made list of conversational queries buyers already use. Once you understand how your audience speaks, weave the terms naturally into your product titles and descriptions. This will increase the odds of your products showing up in ChatGPT when shoppers search. Further reading: 11 Awesome ChatGPT Alternatives to Try When you’re writing copy, pay special attention to your product titles. They often feed directly into the shopping carousel. And they’re the first thing shoppers see before deciding to click. The golden rule: Lead with what matters most to your audience. If trust drives decisions — like in categories such as laptops or smartphones — put your brand front and center. If features, benefits, or use cases are more important, focus on those instead. Use this simple formula: [Main Benefit or Feature] + [Product Type] (+ [Brand] if it builds trust) On Leigh’s site, for example, his titles highlight what buyers care about most: product benefits. That’s why they’re structured as Benefit (Invisible) + Product Type (Undershirt). But when brand recognition is vital to trust, it makes sense to include the brand name. Like this product title for a Sony home theater: Don’t worry about cramming every detail into the title. Most ecommerce platforms give you multiple fields for product info. Use those strategically to sprinkle in conversational keywords. Titles get people to click. Descriptions get them to buy. This is where you expand on features, benefits, and use cases — all in plain, natural language. For example, UnderFit’s product copy mirrors the words buyers use when searching for an undershirt. These words aren’t filler — they’re search terms. Which means they’re likely the same language people use when prompting ChatGPT. Your product’s value proposition needs to be clear and visible at the top of your product page. This ensures ChatGPT immediately understands: But that’s not enough. The rest of your page should support and reinforce that promise. This gives ChatGPT a complete picture of your product. And helps it see your product as the best fit for the query. This means every section — features, benefits, reviews, specs — should back up your value proposition with proof and detail. Huel’s Black Edition product page is a great example of this in action. The value proposition is right under the product title: “High Protein Complete Meal.” This instantly explains: The image reinforces this by highlighting complementary copy: “This is a meal. Not a protein shake” and “40g protein per meal.” The product description repeats the promise yet again: “40 grams of protein.” But it also adds details like “27 essential vitamins and minerals.” This repetition is exactly what you want. While you can (and should) use word variety, your page should tell one clear story from top to bottom. Explain what the product is, why it’s valuable, and how it delivers on that promise. So, audit your site. If copy and images don’t reinforce your core message, rework them until it does. The more consistent and focused your messaging is, the easier it is for ChatGPT to understand (and recommend) your products. Further reading: How to Use AI for Writing Exceptional Content (7 Best Practices) ChatGPT doesn’t just look at your product page when deciding what to recommend. It cross-checks authority signals from across the web to figure out whether your brand (and your product) are trustworthy enough to recommend. These signals include: One way to see which sources matter most for your brand is to run a manual check in ChatGPT. Type a shopping prompt into the tool, scroll to the answer, and click “Sources.” The links you see there are the sites that ChatGPT used to pull its recommendations. (And, by extension, the sites it trusts.) For example, when I asked for a “yoga mat with serious grip for hot yoga,” ChatGPT cited: Use the sources as your roadmap. Target them with outreach strategies like expert quotes, partnerships, and co-branded content. Can’t land mentions on the exact sites ChatGPT cited? Go after similar ones with comparable authority. And build your presence on community platforms, too. A strong showing on Reddit, Quora, and niche Facebook groups can boost your brand’s credibility. Instant Checkout lets shoppers go from product recommendation to purchase without ever leaving ChatGPT. Once they find something they like, they can confirm details, pay, and place an order — all within the same chat window. (Hashtag mind blown) Instant Checkout currently supports single-item purchases in the U.S. on Etsy. (But Shopify integration is coming soon.) If you’re on either platform, you’re in luck. Eligibility is automatic. For everyone else? You’ll need to apply and integrate with OpenAI’s Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP). Translation: Roll up your sleeves. There’s work to do. Here’s what you can do now. Start by filling out OpenAI’s merchant application form. This lets OpenAI know you want in. They’re onboarding merchants on a rolling basis and will reach out when you’re accepted. Once you’re in the pipeline, you’ll need to: Pro tip: Even if ChatGPT Instant Checkout isn’t available for your store yet, preparing your product data, feeds, and backend now will help you move faster when it is. This should give you a head start as this feature gains popularity. It’s not enough to show up in ChatGPT Shopping. You also need to measure how well you’re performing. Start with tracking traffic. The easiest way is through OpenAI’s built-in UTM tag. This is code that OpenAI automatically adds to all outbound links. And looks like this: Set up a custom segment in Google Analytics to track and analyze ChatGPT traffic to your site. Once that’s done, look for patterns: Side note: Not every ChatGPT mention will be traceable. Some users see your product in a chat and search your brand directly on Google instead of clicking. Look for spikes in branded search traffic or direct visits to gauge the broader impact of LLMs. But traffic only tells you what happens after people click. You also need to measure what happens before — specifically, which prompts surface your products. To do this, it helps to understand the kinds of prompts shoppers type. Most fall into four buckets. Think of these buckets as templates. Test prompts in each category and ask yourself: Repeatedly run these checks to gather more data. You’ll learn which prompts lead to product mentions, how your LLM visibility changes, and how buyers talk about your brand. Rather automate this process? Tools like Semrush’s AI SEO Toolkit let you: There isn’t a magic formula for getting ChatGPT to recommend your products.

OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has reached a valuation of $500 billion, following a deal in which current and former employees sold roughly $6.6 billion worth of shares, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters today. This represents a bump-up from its current valuation of $300 billion, underscoring OpenAI's rapid gains in both users and revenue. Reuters reported details of the stock sale earlier in August. As part of the deal, OpenAI employees sold shares to a consortium of investors including Thrive Capital, SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi's MGX and T Rowe Price, according to the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media. The company had authorised sales of $10-billion-plus worth of stock on the secondary market, the source added. Thrive Capital, SoftBank, Dragoneer, MGX and T Rowe Price did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. The share sale adds to SoftBank's earlier investment in OpenAI's $40 billion primary funding round. The company generated around $4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025, about 16% more than it generated all of last year, the Information reported earlier this week. The sale comes at a time when tech giants are competing aggressively for AI talent with lucrative compensation packages. Meta is notably investing billions in Scale AI and poached its 28-year-old CEO, Alexandr Wang, to lead its new super intelligence unit. Accreditation: Reuters © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Economy Candy: Three generations of sweets and success
URL: https://woocommerce.com/posts/economy-candy-custom-woocommerce/
Time Published: 2025-10-01T20:47:09Z
Full Content:
The WooCommerce Blog The WooCommerce Blog October 1, 2025 We recently got to visit Mitchell and Skye Cohen at Economy Candy to learn about the history of their business and how they use WooCommerce. While our team was in New York, we also filmed a short interview, which you can check out below or on our YouTube channel. Want the full story? Keep on reading for all of the sweet, sweet details of their success. 🍬🍭 Please note that some quotes have been edited for clarity and brevity. Economy Candy began in the 1930s as a penny sweets cart outside a shoe and hat repair shop in New York City. Since then, three generations of the Cohen family have turned the business into a Lower East Side mainstay — with the corner of Rivington and Essex named after Mitchell’s grandfather — and national distributor of goodies from around the world. Now, Mitchell Cohen and his wife, Skye Greenfield Cohen, continue that legacy. “Starting before he could even see over the counter, Mitchell would work with his dad behind the register standing on a milk crate, tallying bills and calculating the change in his head,” Skye shared. Skye has also continued an important tradition: ensuring that her husband continued the family business, just as Mitchell’s mother and grandmother had done for their husbands. Their most recent evolution included an upgraded ecommerce strategy in March of 2020. When they overhauled their website, which luckily happened just in time for Covid-19 closures, they also updated their store operations. Economy Candy brought nearly 2,500 SKUs into their online store, live syncing their inventory management, and began using a combination of shipping and local pickup options to keep their business going (and their customers happy) through the pandemic and beyond. Economy Candy has weathered significant worldwide and local catastrophes in its 88-year history, and yet, they’re still going strong. Their enduring presence is due in large part to their commitment to their customers, maintaining the accessibility of their products through all of the challenging times. Over the past five years, they’ve added nearly 500 new products to their inventory — which now boasts an astounding 2,500 different sweets and goodies. Getting to 2,500 SKUs, however, required an operational pivot: all of their inventory operations used to reside exclusively in Mitchell’s brain. “Up until the pandemic, all of Economy Candy’s inventory was stored in Mitchell’s head,” Skye shared. “Our staff had to memorize the prices of all 2,000+ items we carried because we were still using dumb cash registers where the price of each item had to be manually entered. In 2021 we took a leap into the 21st century and upgraded to Square digital registers.” Their modernization coincided with the pandemic, which exasperated the need for efficient (and online-friendly) inventory management. Not allowed to bring staff in-store, Mitchell and Skye moved all sales online, managing fulfillment themselves. In 2021, they added Square digital registers and implemented barcode scanning, using Thrive to sync in-store sales with their ecommerce business. Economy Candy has been online since the dawn of the millennium. In their hunt for a solution that didn’t feel restricted in functionality or growth, they switched platforms several times until 2015 — when they found WooCommerce. “When WooCommerce was presented to us, it was clear that limitations would no longer be an issue. Because WooCommerce is open source, there is no ceiling. There’s no limit to what you can do, what you can customize, what you can create. And it’s been great ever since.”— Skye Greenfield Cohen, Co-owner, Economy Candy Their WooCommerce store is responsible for 20 to 25% of their total sales each year, with seasonal spikes in traffic around the holidays. Thrive sits between WooCommerce and Economy Candy’s other third-party tools, and syncs sales data for in-store purchases, online transactions, and ShipStation. They’ve also integrated the site with UPS, FedEx, Route, Mailchimp, Google, and Meta. With a total of 57 active plugins and custom code, Economy Candy manages a complex network of tools and services. “It’s incredible the way that WooCommerce is able to talk to all these different programs.”— Skye Greenfield Cohen, Co-owner, Economy Candy One aspect that Mitchell and Skye love about WooCommerce is the breadth of options for customization — something that comes in handy when your products might melt during warmer seasons: “Shipping chocolate in the summer is tough. It is a challenge, but one thing that Woo has been great [for], there’s a myriad of popups and messages that you can easily set up.” “[For example,] I can set a warning,” noted Skye, “for anything that’s chocolate, put this text on that page so that the person ordering it knows that this is chocolate, there is a risk of melting. Do they want to add ice? Do they want to add cold packaging? So all those plugins [allow us to] set it and forget it… And it has really made shipping chocolate much less of a heartbreak.” Their focus on customer satisfaction has been the key to their success: “Economy Candy has survived for nearly 90 years on word of mouth,” Skye shared. “Of course, what ‘word of mouth’ means has changed a bit in the last century, from literal word of mouth to now including having our customers post about us on TikTok and Instagram and having a social media presence ourselves.” To inspire that organic promotion, they follow the rule of threes: If three people give the same feedback or request, they do their best to accommodate it. This often impacts their product and inventory decisions, from importing international sweets to making sure they stock candy from their oldest customers’ youth. They take a similar approach to new product decisions, considering the selection from the customer’s point of view: Would the customer be excited to see it in store, or has someone requested something similar? Is it a unique product that they haven’t seen before? Mitchell and Skye are also mindful of future generations of their audience. Their Gen Z staff members help them stay up to date on TikTok trends and viral sweets, such as Swedish candy, freeze-dried candy, and slime lickers. As the business grows, Economy Candy continues to play to WooCommerce’s strengths. Taking advantage of all of the customization options, Mitchell and Skye know that they can change direction whenever the need arises. “Being able to pivot without recreating your website from scratch every few years, which we used to do — now we’re making tweaks on an existing platform instead of starting from scratch, and that saves a lot of money, a lot of time.”— Mitchell Cohen, Co-owner, Economy Candy “With WooCommerce as the central foothold of our platform and adding pieces around that, … EconomyCandy.com is customized to what EconomyCandy.com needs to be for Economy Candy customers and for Economy Candy staff to be able to operate on the backend. We are able to put in all those custom functionalities that work for our specific business.” About Ship your WooCommerce orders with confidence, save on top carriers, and automate your processes with ShipStation.

Title: Morgan Stanley: Adobe’s Future at Risk Due to AI
URL: https://petapixel.com/2025/10/01/morgan-stanley-adobes-future-at-risk-due-to-ai/
Time Published: 2025-10-01T19:31:25Z

Morgan Stanley has downgraded Adobe’s stock rating, cutting its price target for the software giant amidst a perceived inability to stand out amidst the rise of generative AI. According to a report from The Street, top Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss noted a growing gap between Adobe’s AI development (and promises) and reported revenue in its Digital Media division. “Since that upgrade, we have seen the Digital Media annual recurring revenue (ARR) growth directionality diverge from the pace and quality of innovation being embedded within the product portfolio,” Weiss writes in his report. The full report notes that Adobe’s revenue which it can tie directly to its AI-based efforts has been lagging, and monetization is going slowly. Compounding issues are growing from competitors like Canva, Google, and Meta, who all have introduced AI-based features that they can more directly tie to revenue growth. As a result, Morgan Stanley lowered their price target for Adobe from $520 to $450. It doesn’t look like it’s close to even hitting that lower mark, however, as the stock has been steadily falling in the past couple of weeks. It hit $353 per share on September 24 and sits at $344 on October 1. Adobe’s current weakened situation is likely a product of its own making. For the last year, Adobe has been shouting loudly about its AI development and the power of its in-house generative AI platform, Firefly. However, after updates and iterations, Firefly remains significantly behind competitors in terms of usefulness. While its select subject and remove tools have become a lot better over the last couple of months, for most of the year, its generative tools have been downright ghastly, resulting in Eldritch nightmares that don’t solve the problems they should. Its AI-based generative video tool is still far from being usable. The AI situation at Adobe has been so behind that the company recently opened up its platform to use other Generative AI tools — most recently Nano Banana — diminishing the value of its “responsible” AI to the degree that Adobe seems less concerned with it now than ever, especially as pressure mounts to make good on its AI-based revenue promises. In June, Adobe finally started tracking generative AI use through its apps via credits, which will very likely be an indicator that Adobe can use to tie AI to revenue. But if those numbers aren’t high and showing an upward trend, investors still won’t be happy. That’s tricky for the software company, as the main users of its Digital Media division are still artists, many of whom are less than happy with the proliferation of generative AI that has been trained on human work, effectively stealing knowledge so it can be sold back to them. Adobe is not wholly beloved by its customers either, who regularly clamor for someone else to step in and give Adobe competition. Its recent foray into social media network Bluesky is the best example of how Adobe’s customers feel as the company was hit with so much backlash after joining that it was effectively forced off the platform.
