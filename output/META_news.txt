Now, finally, we know everything there is to know about the device, which is officially called the Samsung Galaxy XR. It’s the product of a massive collaboration between Samsung, Google, and Qualcomm, and it’s packed with impressive tech. I got to spend some time with the device at Samsung’s New York City launch event last week, and I want to say something a little unexpected, something I noticed after testing it. While Samsung clearly wants to sell as many of these as possible — it is a business chasing profit, after all — it was also made clear to me at the keynote that the well-known Apple Vision Pro sales failure is hanging heavy over this launch. In fact, this is one of the few launches I’ve ever been to in which the presenters actively told us that this product is “just the beginning” and that better things are on the way. So that leads us to the big question, which is whether or not you will actually buy this $1,799 headset. And let me tell you a secret: I think Samsung isn’t expecting you to. After my hands-on demo, it was clear that this headset is likely a foundational product designed to pave the way for the real revolution: future smart glasses powered by Android XR. Before I get into all that, though, let me tell you about the headset. If you’ve ever used a VR headset before, there are no real surprises here. The Galaxy XR hasn’t changed all that much from when it was first shown off as a prototype way back in December 2024. It has a glass front that protects multiple cameras and sensors. There are thick straps that connect the main headset to the back padding, which has a big dial on it for tightening or loosening the straps. There are three buttons on the headset: a multi-function button on the top right, and then a volume rocker on the top left. It was comfortable to wear, and it comes with removable light blockers that can help you be more immersed in your content by blocking off your peripheral vision. Conversely, you can remove them to keep yourself grounded in the real world (and hopefully offset any VR dizziness). Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority? Like Apple’s Vision Pro, the battery is not built into the headset. Instead, it’s a self-contained pack (see below) that connects to the device using a proprietary pin system. You can keep the battery in your pocket or rest it on the couch next to you while you are immersed in the VR world. The reason the Galaxy XR is designed this way is to keep that hefty battery weight off your head, which should make it more comfortable to use it for extended periods. According to Samsung, you should be able to get about two hours of use based on one battery pack charge. There’s been no word on whether or not you’ll be able to buy additional battery packs. Inside the headset are two displays (3,552 x 3,840 at 60Hz, 72Hz, or 90Hz) that automatically adjust themselves based on your face. This is made possible thanks to multiple sensors and cameras inside that perform eye-tracking functions. This means you don’t need to fiddle with knobs or move the lenses around to get the right focus — the headset does all the adjustments for you. For audio, there are small speakers above your ears that blast the sound out. This allows you to avoid wearing headphones and also lets you still hear the real world around you. Of course, if you’d prefer to use Bluetooth headphones, that’s totally fine, as the headset supports Bluetooth connections of all kinds, including earbuds, gaming controllers, mice and keyboards, and more. Unfortunately, the Galaxy XR doesn’t come with any of that stuff. When you buy it, you just get the headset and the battery pack. Samsung has made VR-style controllers specifically for the Galaxy XR, but they are an additional purchase. The fact that the headset doesn’t come with controllers is not such a big deal, though, as Google and Samsung want you to use your hands and your voice for controls all the time. So how do you use it without controllers? This is where the magic of the device really becomes apparent. Outside the headset, multiple cameras and sensors track everything your hands do in real-time. There are lots of downward-facing cameras on the front that capture your hand motions. Using these, you can control the operating system with hand gestures. A pinch acts as a left mouse click, and a pinch and hold acts as holding down the left mouse button, so you can drag windows around. You can use two hands to pinch to zoom in and out. Turning your hand around and pinching opens menus. Meanwhile, the eye-tracking cameras inside are monitoring your eyes at all times. This allows you to simply look at something and the headset understands what you’re looking at, which makes controlling things faster and easier. With this combination of hand- and eye-tracking, you can manipulate things in your VR environment without needing to hold a controller or have any sort of apparatus on your hands or wrists. The headset also offers opportunities for augmented reality experiences. The real world can be projected into the headset in full color with very low latency. Using Circle to Search, you could circle pretty much anything in the real world and do a search for it. Of course, you probably wouldn’t be caught dead wearing this around town, but it is fully wireless, so you could if you wanted to. The Galaxy XR hardware is all Samsung, but the software — known as Android XR — is all Google. As its name suggests, this is based on Android, so it works very similarly to what you’ve been using on your phones and tablets for nearly two decades. I expected it to come with something like One UI on board with a distinctly Samsung-ified look and feel, but instead, all I saw everywhere was Google apps in their usual stock style. There was nothing in the software that said Samsung at all, at least nothing that was shown in the keynote or demoed for me during my session. Every single thing was Google this and Google that. Where’s Galaxy AI? Where’s One UI? Where are the Samsung apps? Where’s Bixby? Regardless, because Android XR is based on Android, nearly every app and game on the Play Store will automatically work with the headset. It will present the app in its native format in a 2D window, and you can use it as normal. However, we do have a lot of unanswered questions about the OS. Will it be available to any company that wants to make a headset, just like Android is available to any company that wants to make a phone? How much will companies be able to customize it? How often will devices get updates? I asked a Google rep about all this, and they said that the company would announce all that in due time. So what is it actually like using this thing? At its core, the Galaxy XR is simply a VR headset with multiple opportunities for entertainment. The two most significant differentiators from the competition are its gaming prowess and the deep integration of Google’s Gemini. If you’re a gamer, you should know that this headset is going to be much better for gaming than the Apple Vision Pro and maybe even the Meta Quest 3. It will support Steam VR games when connected to a VR-ready PC and will also support 2D games through existing apps like Steam Link and Moonlight. It will also support pretty much every game on the Google Play Store. Connecting a standard controller to the headset via Bluetooth is dead simple. As mentioned earlier, you’ll be able to get VR-style controllers from Samsung as an additional purchase, opening the doors to all sorts of existing VR games. Apple made a big mistake by not working hard to support these kinds of experiences with the Vision Pro, so it’s great to see Google and Samsung aren’t making the same mistake. Even more significant than gaming, though, is Gemini. When Google announced Android XR at the end of 2024, it specifically called out that it was the first operating system designed from the ground up for what it calls the Gemini era. In other words, Android XR was built with Gemini already in mind. As such, it permeates everywhere throughout the operating system. You can activate Gemini at any time by holding down the multi-function button. This allows you to not only speak to Gemini but also easily show it your display, allowing you to ask questions about what you’re doing. For example, you could be playing a game and pull up Gemini to help you out with it. You wouldn’t need to explain anything to it, because it would be able to see the game, what level you’re on, your character’s health, and all that. If you have a bunch of windows open within your virtual environment, you can just ask Gemini to organize them for you. The really cool thing is that you can do this conversationally using Gemini Live; you don’t need to say “Hey Gemini” all the time. The demos I tried really hammered home how central Gemini is to the experience. The first thing I saw was Google Photos. The app looks and works just like it does on your phone, but the software can make any photo stereoscopic, which means it appears to have depth. You can easily turn this on or off with any photo in your library, and the depth effect is created on-device on the fly. Gemini works here for helping you find specific photos without needing to scroll through. Just say, “Show me my photos from our trip to France, Gemini.” After Google Photos, we jumped into Google Maps. You start out with an aerial view of the Earth, as if you were floating in space. You can then tell Gemini to take you anywhere you like, and you’ll zoom into that area, floating above it like a bird. You can then zoom in even further to explore places in street view, so it feels like you’re walking around the destination. Here, you can have a chat with Gemini as you’re exploring. Let’s say you spot a landmark; you can simply look at it and ask Gemini about it, and the AI will tell you whatever you want to know. The really cool thing, though, is you can actually walk inside select buildings. Google does this by using AI to stitch together existing photos and videos available on Google Maps, creating a realistic 3D environment. There are already over 1,000 locations in New York that work for this, such as the restaurant in the video below. Finally, we tried YouTube. I viewed an immersive 360-degree video shot specifically for headsets like the Galaxy XR, as well as an interactive 3D film where I could reach out and “touch” objects. I also watched one of my own videos that was automatically converted to be stereoscopic, which was pretty cool. However, that specific feature will not work when you take the Galaxy XR out of the box. Eventually, it will work on most YouTube videos, but it will be a while before it’s active. The Samsung Galaxy XR starts at $1,799, which is literally half the price of the Apple Vision Pro. While this definitely makes the device more affordable, $1,800 is still very, very expensive. This isn’t a tech product you just decide to buy one day. The Vision Pro has also been a well-established bomb for Apple, with sales figures estimated to be less than one million units. Samsung might be undercutting Apple on price by a wide margin, but that doesn’t change the fact that it’s launching into a market that even Apple, the master of busting up existing markets, couldn’t crack. This is why I think the Galaxy XR is just an opening act. The real revolution will be smart glasses that do most of the things the Galaxy XR can do, but do it in the real world. We know this is coming, too, because Samsung and Google are already hyping them up with partnerships with Warby Parker and Gentle Monster. If Samsung and its partners can make smart glasses that allow you to bring Android XR with you wherever you go and include an AI companion that can jump in and help you whenever needed, it could have a revolution on its hands. The Galaxy XR seems like a terrific product, but it’s still, at its core, just another VR headset. Most people who buy this will use it to play games and watch movies in their homes, by themselves. That doesn’t add up to a device that changes your life — that adds up to a TV screen you attach to your face. The idea that you can already do that with existing devices— and have been able to for a decade — makes this feel less like a revolutionary new product and more like a way-too-late entry into a plateaued market. So, will you buy the Galaxy XR? Or will you wait for the real revolution, which will be future smart glasses with Android XR on board? Based on what I saw, this is a very impressive tech demo that serves as a foundation for something much greater. It’s a device that feels designed to get developers and early adopters hooked on the Android XR ecosystem. But, in the end, all it’s doing is preparing them for the main event that’s still to come.

Title: The 3 Best Growth Stocks To Buy For November 2025

ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Applied Digital is a rapidly expanding AI data center operator, securing large contracts and building new capacity to meet soaring demand.Broadcom is a strong contender in AI infrastructure, providing innovative, cost-effective custom AI chips that outperform competitors.Eli Lilly dominates the booming diabetes- and obesity-drug markets with blockbuster products and has a robust pipeline of new treatments. It's tough to say for sure which growth stocks will be winners without a crystal ball. But investors may wish to consider investing in AI data center operator Applied Digital, AI semiconductor provider Broadcom and the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly. These three companies have solid prospects for gains in addition to some better-known companies, such as Nvidia and Palantir. Applied Digital, Broadcom and Lilly have the potential to rise in the short and long term. If they beat earnings targets and raise guidance, their share prices will keep rising. If they tap their strong competitive positions to win more market share, they'll see lasting success. These stocks were selected based on their rapid growth, good chance of exceeding expectations, and strong products and management. If a company is growing rapidly now and has a track record of beating expectations, its stock is likely to rise. However, to sustain those increases over time, a company must innovate. If the company has great products and excellent management, better-than-expected growth is more likely to last. The three best growth stocks are ranked below in descending order of their stock price change in 2025 as of Oct. 21. More generally, the three stocks are ranked from the highest to lowest return and risk. Read on to learn why. Although it is not profitable, Applied Digital has grown rapidly. In the company's first quarter of fiscal 2026, revenue increased 84% to $64.2 million, exceeding analyst expectations by $14.2 million, CNBC reported. Applied Digital is benefiting from soaring demand for AI data centers. An estimated $350 billion will be spent in 2025 by large cloud services providers called hyperscalers. CoreWeave – a leading AI cloud services provider – recently leased 150 megawatts of Applied Digital’s Polaris Forge 1 campus, bringing Applied Digital’s total anticipated contracted lease revenue to about $11 billion over 15 years, CNBC also reported. Strong demand for Applied Digital’s services looks likely to continue at least through 2026. That's one reason, the company is building a 200 megawatt Polaris Forge 2 campus and is in “advanced discussions with hyperscalers,” according to CRN, with management projecting leased capacity for both Applied Digital campuses as high as 600 MW. Broadcom is benefiting from demand for AI infrastructure. In the company’s third quarter of fiscal year 2025, AI semiconductor revenue grew 53% to $5.2 billion. The company is also gaining from a shift in AI chip architecture through Broadcom’s 65% revenue share of application-specific integrated circuits for hyperscalers, according to Ainvest. Broadcom provides hyperscalers with AI chips that deliver faster performance at lower prices than Nvidia’s products. The chip provider’s clients include Google, Meta, ByteDance and reportedly OpenAI, “representing a strategic alternative to purchasing Nvidia's GPUs," CNBC said. More specifically, Broadcom’s custom AI accelerators deliver three to five times better performance-per-watt than Nvidia GPUs at a roughly $20,000 to $15,000 lower per unit cost, Datagravity estimated. Such innovation has enabled Broadcom to exceed Wall Street expectations for eight consecutive quarters, typically resulting in 10% to 20% stock increases on earnings-announcement days, Ainvest reported. Broadcom’s stock price could rise in November. A September announcement of a $10 billion order for the Titan AI inference chip from a fourth hyperscale customer— believed to be OpenAI —demonstrates Broadcom is winning new hyperscale customers. Though this program is scheduled to begin in the third quarter of fiscal year 2026, pre-production revenue and additional design wins could emerge in fourth-quarter 2025 results, Tom's Hardware predicted. Eli Lilly is an American pharmaceutical company combining strong profitability and rapid growth with its market-leading diabetes and obesity treatments. Lilly’s latest financial results, in the second quarter of 2025 showed that revenue rose 38% to $15.56 billion, with net income increasing 91% to nearly $6.7 billion, according to a company release. Lilly dominates the market for diabetes and weight loss drugs. More specifically, Lilly controls about 57% of the U.S. market for incretins – enjoying a competitive advantage over rival Novo Nordisk, Reuters reported. Lilly has experienced rapid growth in demand for two drugs: Mounjaro, which helps manage blood-sugar levels in adults with diabetes, and Zepbound, for treating obesity and weight-related conditions. In Q2, sales of these products grew 68% to $5.2 billion for Mounjaro and 172% to nearly $3.4 billion for Zepbound. The company communicated its optimism about future growth, raising its full-year 2025 guidance above Wall Street expectations. It's projecting $60 billion to $62 billion in revenue and EPS between $21.75 and $23.00 amid strong demand. A new obesity treatment called retatrutide, which is expected to report positive trial results late in 2025, provides another reason for optimism, Pharmaceutical-Journal noted. Moreover, An Alzheimer’s therapy called donanemab, sold under the brand name Kisunla, was approved in 2025 and could help Lilly exceed investor’s revenue expectations. Investors looking for stocks with upside potential may consider betting on shares of Applied Digital, Broadcom and Eli Lilly. While Applied Digital is losing money and investing to build capacity, its rapid revenue growth and feverish demand from hyperscalers makes it a compelling short-term investment. Broadcom is a much larger, profitable beneficiary of AI chip demand while Lilly’s commanding lead in the booming markets for treatment of diabetes and obesity is propelling rapid growth, which could be even faster if the company shares positive results from new drug trials.

Hyman is an economist and financial analyst specializing in the energy sector. He headed utility equity research at a major brokerage house and… More Info Here is a funny thing about valuation “bubbles” involving financial instruments. In every individual case, you unavoidably end up asking: "What were they thinking?” Or stated differently, what causes a significant part of the supposedly rational investing public to collectively lose their minds for a relatively brief period? A few tulip bulbs, for example, were valued more highly than a modest Amsterdam house in 1637, until they weren’t. Leveraged speculation in frontier commodity markets of Asia and America led to the South Sea Bubble and the Mississippi Bubble in Europe in the 1720s. The seventeenth and eighteenth-century bubbles were commodity bubbles: tulips, spices, or beaver pelts. But the Railway Mania in the UK in the mid-1840s focused on an amazing new technology, railroads, marketed to the public as risk-free investments. That the British railroad companies' shares ultimately soared and then lost more than two-thirds of their value, immiserating a large portion of the investing public, is almost besides the point. Bubbles always end badly by definition. But the UK’s railway mania is instructive because it was the first truly modern bubble which had all three components of more recent financial bubbles: 1) a new technology, railroads for moving goods and people, the long term economic impacts of which are unclear; 2) financial innovation usually involving leverage or speculation and 3) a government that either participates in the scheme or has little inclination to intervene in financial markets (until it’s too late). Related: Tanker Explosion Off Yemen Deepens Red Sea Security Fears for LPG Trade Using this as a framework, it seems fair to ask if today’s AI stocks, which have substantially outperformed broad market indices, are in a financial bubble? But we’re utility analysts asking this question for a simple reason. The demands for new electric power-generating facilities supposedly required by AI are simply staggering both in amount and expense. For example, the highly respected Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) expects new AI-related electricity demand to reach 50 gigawatts (GW) by 2030. A Deloitte study showed AI electric demand increasing from 4GW now to 123 GW by 2035. And Sam Altman’s Open AI Consortium (including Softbank and Oracle) stated it would need roughly 250 GW by 2033, which at today’s prices would cost over half a trillion bucks to build. (To put these numbers in context, total generating capacity in the USA, presently, is 1,300 GW, growing about 30 GW per year.) All we can say is that with respect to power costs, the AI industry is behaving as if they are either irrelevant or simply a modest expense item, neither of which is true. Utility assets and AI data centers resemble each other in that both are highly capital-intensive, but with one big difference. The heart of a utility is a power plant that lasts forty years (an annual depreciation rate of 2.5%). The primary cost component of a data center is the vast array of computer chips, which have a relatively short life, maybe 2-3 years. A capital asset with a two-year life has a 50% depreciation rate, creating a very large expense item on the income statement, which has to be covered by revenues from the business or by increased corporate borrowing. That still doesn’t make the AI/data center boom a bubble, but it does suggest our next concern. Capital expenditures for AI and data centers seem high. Not just to us. In fact, economists have noted that in the first half of 2025, AI-related capital expenditures contributed more to US domestic growth than consumer spending. This marks a dramatic reversal of prior trends, where consumer spending has been responsible for the bulk of economic activity. All we can conclude here is that this highlights the biggest financial risk for AI investors: will all these new facilities earn a competitive return on all this new, invested capital? Will there be enough revenues to support these new assets? We know the level of planned capex and that there are exciting uses for this technology. We do not know how much people will pay for these services, and therein lies a huge risk. This boom (bubble?) reminds us of the power-generating bubble that burst in the early days of the century. When the power generating market was opened to competition, a host of legacy electricity firms, bankers, entrepreneurs, pipelines, European utilities, and crooks piled in to build a multitude of power plants, encouraged by favorable forward price curves and plenty of low-cost borrowed money. They knew that all the construction (if completed) would produce a power glut, but they all believed that the other guy would back down and not build, thereby preventing an oversupply. Well, the other guys did not back down, demand for power was weak, and carnage followed. There are other related risks here, such as the role of vendor financing. The biggest players in this area (Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Nvidia) are financially robust. But they support an ecosystem of smaller vendors and suppliers who rely exclusively for their infrastructure and software on the aforementioned giants. This creates a circular financing scheme where one group sells products to another wholly captive or financially dependent group while purchasing their services. In a bubble, this is all financed with common stock issuances at ever higher valuations. Which works until it doesn’t. Then the house of cards falls down, as it did in the housing and dot-com bubbles earlier this century. The AI boom assumes that the tech bros in California, choosing an AI strategy, picked the right horse. The Chinese seem to think otherwise, offering less expensive AI solutions to less expensive problems, more or less. Chinese industry has shown, with government help, a remarkable ability to take ideas from abroad and commercialize them into a lower-cost product. AI is in their targets. That may put these huge American AI investments at risk. So don’t start to count the profits. Let’s conclude with these observations about financial bubbles. First, there is a kind of conflation in the term between genuinely nonsensical ideas and those viable corporations whose shares were simply grossly misvalued. When the dot-com bubble burst around the year 2000, the shares of Amazon declined by over 90%. But it is still around, bigger than ever. Pet food supplier Pets.com, on the other hand, which lost money on every sale, is not. If we go back to our original example of the British railway mania of the 1840s, we can observe something similar. Those railroads, which provided an enormous economic boost to a rapidly industrializing British economy, also caused grievous financial injury to a generation of investors because of the wild misvaluation of the fledgling industry employing a radically new technology, the steam engine. But the legacy of that technology bubble was a fully functioning national railway system that still exists. So, after this AI and data center investor euphoria passes, the investors lose their money and the smoke lifts, what remains, just ashes or many valuable, profitable, important businesses?

Title: The Jio tariff hike everyone expected isn’t coming—yet

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, India’s largest telecom operator by market share, has no immediate plans to increase mobile phone tariffs, belying market expectations, choosing instead to grow revenue by driving users to consume more data. Jio and its closest rival Bharti Airtel Ltd recently removed their entry-level plans to bump up their average revenue per user (or Arpu, a key performance metric for telecom operators), triggering expectations that the telecom operators would increase tariffs towards the end of the year or in early 2026. “We are nudging consumers to consume more and happily pay more, but no immediate plans for the tariff (hike)," said Anshuman Thakur, head of strategy at Reliance Jio Infocomm, during an earnings call with analysts. In the September quarter, Jio’s monthly average revenue per user rose 1.2% to ₹211.4 from ₹208.8 at the end of June, with growth slowing due to promotional 5G offers, according to the company. Following Jio’s decision to remove its entry-level pack, analysts had expected it to both raise tariffs and focus on premium services to close the gap with Bharti Airtel, which leads the industry in terms of Arpu ( ₹250 at the end of June). Airtel is yet to declare its September-quarter earnings. “If Reliance were not to increase tariffs in the next few months, its [year-on-year] Arpu growth for the March quarter would likely be 4% (at say ₹214/subscriber)," J.P. Morgan analysts said in a note dated 19 October. “Investors continue to expect Jio to raise telecom tariffs ahead of the proposed IPO of Reliance Jio (likely by June 2026)." Jio net added 8.3 million mobile subscribers during the September quarter, taking its subscriber base to 506.4 million. At the end of September, Jio had 234 million 5G subscribers, up from 213 million in the preceding June quarter. 5G now accounts for 50% of Jio’s total wireless traffic. Leading tariff hikesWhen telecom operators raised tariffs in July 2024 after a gap of over two years, it was Reliance Jio that took the lead with a 12–25% price hike.

Yet you have to make money," Bharti Airtel’s managing director and vice chairman Gopal Vittal said at an industry event earlier this month, adding that there was room for raising telecom tariffs. In fact, Vittal had earlier called for a change in the telecom tariff structure, by reducing data allowances on some telecom packs and charging for more data. “Though RIL (Reliance Industries) is non-committal on possible tariff hike, management indicated they have other levers like unlimited 5G slab increase, etc., to drive Arpu growth along with the accelerated roll out of FTTH (fiber-to-the-home)/FWA (fixed wireless access)," Antique Stock Broking analysts said in a note dated 19 October.

You don't necessarily have to choose between the stocks of two Big Tech giants—but if you must, Oppenheimer has a pick for you. Shares of both Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (META), owner of Facebook and Instagram, have been strong performers this year, outpacing the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) and the S&P 500. Still, Oppenheimer's analysts prefer the former's shares to the latter's. On Sunday, they put a $300 price tag on Alphabet, about 18% above Friday's close and the highest on Wall Street, and an $825 target on Meta, 15% higher than last week's finish and below Visible Alpha's analyst average. The Oppenheimer analysts cited what they considered "more conservative" Street estimates on Alphabet, along with a lower valuation on the shares. While the Magnificent Seven group of big tech stocks has outpaced the S&P 500 this year, under the hood there are signs that it might make sense to pick and choose carefully among them. One example: Three of the stocks have underperformed the S&P 500 this year. "While we are positive on the long-term benefits from Meta's push into AI and proven ability to outgrow peers," they wrote, "we are more bullish on [Alphabet] near term, given more conservative estimates and lower valuation." While the Magnificent 7 is running ahead of the S&P 500 this year, it's not surprising that investors might be looking to pick and choose among the group these days: Three of the seven stocks have underperformed the benchmark index year-to-date. More stocks outside the group are lifting the index than in recent years, Capital Group wrote last week, a reference to what's known as market breadth, marking "a healthy move away from the extreme concentration that raised concerns about risks to investor portfolios." "Rising valuations among companies in the index and more clarity on tariffs and interest rate cuts could help lift the U.S. equities market, which has trailed those in Europe and elsewhere," Capital Group wrote.

The company is also investing significantly in new energy initiatives and artificial intelligence. Jio Platforms added more subscribers, and Reliance Retail saw robust sales growth. Analysts have slightly improved their outlook for the company.

Title: $200B AppLovin faces data privacy probe after short-sellers allege misconduct: sources
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/10/19/business/applovin-faces-data-privacy-probe-after-short-sellers-allege-misconduct-sources/
Time Published: 2025-10-19T17:58:32Z
Full Content:
Fast-growing tech giant AppLovin is facing fresh regulatory heat over its handling of consumer data –including potential investigations by multiple state attorneys general, The Post has learned. The Silicon Valley firm – a mobile advertising juggernaut worth more than $200 billion that made headlines this spring with an offer to buy TikTok – was rocked this month by a reported Securities and Exchange Commission probe over data privacy. The SEC is investigating whether AppLovin “misled investors about its data collection and ad-targeting methods” after short-sellers alleged it had used digital “fingerprints” to improperly track users for targeted ads, according to Bloomberg. On Wednesday, AppLovin said it shut down a product called “Array” that an ad researcher claimed downloaded apps onto user’s phones without their consent. The disclosure came days after researcher Ben Edelman, who holds a short position on AppLovin, claimed in an Oct. 13 report to have found source code that enabled forced downloads. Edelman’s allegations remain unsubstantiated. A rep for AppLovin responded that “users must explicitly consent to download an application as a result of any of our ads,” noting that “Array was a test product.” Meanwhile, state regulators, including staff from the attorneys general from Delaware, Oregon and Connecticut, have reached out to multiple short sellers, seemingly as part of a preliminary investigation into AppLovin, according to sources close to the situation and emails reviewed by The Post. The probe, which apparently began in March and continued through the summer, is focused on AppLovin’s data collection practices, according to sources familiar with the investigation. Delaware has taken the lead on the probe, which is thought to be in its early stages, sources said. Several third-party data brokers with ties to AppLovin have received subpoenas as part of the probe, the sources added. “We do not comment on, confirm, or deny investigations,” a spokesperson for the Delaware attorney general’s office said. When provided a detailed list of questions for comment, AppLovin said it is “not engaged in any investigations with any state attorneys general regarding its business; nor has the Company been contacted by any state attorneys general regarding any such alleged investigation.” “AppLovin operates an advertising platform with industry-consistent, platform policies and enforcement measures regarding, among other things, ad content,” the company added in a statement. “These platform policies and measures apply to both publishers and demand side users (i.e., advertisers), and specifically address things like explicit content and other ad content.’ In addition to any local data privacy and consumer protection laws, states have enforcement authority under the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act, a federal law meant to shield online users 13 or younger. In 2023, a coalition of 33 states sued Meta alleging violations of COPPA. It couldn’t be learned if the state investigators were focused on potential violations of COPPA or any other specific law in their probe. So far, the allegations have done little to slow the meteoric rise of AppLovin, which has been fueled by interest in its AI-powered software that helps app developers find new users and sell advertising. The company, which claims to have built a better mousetrap in an ad tech sector long dominated by Meta and Google, has seen shares surge 80% this year and was recently added to the S&P 500. Founded in 2012 by CEO Adam Foroughi, John Krystynak and Andrew Karam, AppLovin was originally centered on mobile gaming, but has increasingly refocused its business on its app monetization software. AppLovin’s rapid rise was threatened in February by a slew of short seller reports published by firms including Fuzzy Panda Research, Muddy Waters and Culper Research. AppLovin has denied the claims in these reports. In its bombshell analysis, Fuzzy Panda alleged that AppLovin “appears to be illegally tracking children” in violation of federal law – in part by assigning unique digital “fingerprints” to underage accounts specifically labeled “do not track” and despite Apple and Google policies prohibiting the practice. Fuzzy Panda also published evidence that AppLovin allegedly served explicit and violent third-party animated ads despite parental controls being activated. Those included one that depicted a scantily clad woman being spanked by her boss and another showing an elderly grandmother being attacked with a cleaver. In the report that allegedly contributed to the probe, Fuzzy Panda said it set up a dummy account for a 10-year-old boy to test AppLovin’s alleged data tracking – and found that the firm assigned a unique ID tracking the account as it played games titled “Save The Girl!” and “Mr. Bullet 3D.” Fuzzy Panda accused AppLovin of combining those identifiers with data from third-party brokers to “enhance the fingerprint and effectively track children” in violation of federal law. In the report, Fuzzy Panda said its analysis of an old but still-accessible software development kit used by AppLovin revealed the firm was “collecting 50 different attributes from children’s devices including (geolocation data; unique device identification; and even the exact boot-up time to millisecond” that could be used to specify which users in a household were kids. The Post could not independently verify the analysis. Apple explicitly bars developers from “fingerprinting” users, underage or otherwise, in its terms of service, as did Google until it tweaked the policy in February. Culper Research alleged on Feb. 26 that it had uncovered evidence that AppLovin had “systematically deployed, then exploited incredibly dangerous app permissions that enable in-app ads themselves to force-feed silent, backdoor app installations directly onto users’ phones, with just a single click.” Culper cited research by Edelman, who later released his own report this month in which he compiled more than 200 user complaints about alleged forced downloads linked to AppLovin’s Array product, including cases where users reportedly noticed apps downloading without a notification as they watched an ad on their phone. Foroughi previously denied short seller allegations of wrongdoing in a Feb 26 blog post, writing that the company does not track kids’ data and is compliant with all app store rules. “It’s disappointing that a few nefarious short-sellers are making false and misleading claims aimed at undermining our success, and driving down our stock price for their own financial gain, rather than acknowledging the sophisticated AI models our team has built to enhance advertising for our partners,” Foroughani said at the time. When reached for comment for this story, an AppLovin rep reiterated that the short seller reports are “false and misleading” made by parties with “clear financial motivations,” and contradicted by “third party sources” as well as the company’s own statements. The allegations against AppLovin emerged as Congress steps up its efforts to protect kids online in response to several major scandals in which underage users were exposed to harmful content or privacy violations. Earlier this year, Senate lawmakers reintroduced an updated version of COPPA, which would bar targeted ads for people under age 17. Other legal challenges are brewing, including a suit by a California resident who claims that AppLovin tracked her “purchasing decisions, app usage…her movements and locations” without her permission and despite her turning off location tracking software on her phone. The complaint alleges that AppLovin continued to track her using reverse IP look-up technology and “monetized” her information to “unknown third parties.” Advertisement
