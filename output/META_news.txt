March 31, 2025 04:03 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, March 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Webscale Market Review, 4Q24: Annual capex breaks the $300B mark" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. This report reviews the growth and development of the webscale network operator (webscale, aka hyperscale) market since 2011. The webscale market consists of big tech providers building large networks of data centers as part of their operations. The webscale tracker covers 22 companies. In 2024, webscalers represented $2.596 trillion (T) in revenues (+9.4% YoY), $314 billion (B) in R&D spending (+7.1% YoY), and $304B in capex (+55.5% YoY). They had $643B of cash and short-term investments (-5.3% YoY) on the books as of December 2024, and $545B in total debt (-3.4% YoY). The value of webscalers' net plant, property & equipment (net PP&E) on the books as of December 2024 was $922B, up 28.3% YoY. Webscalers employed approximately 4.234 million (M) people at the end of 4Q24, up 1.2% from the Dec. 2023 total of 4.185M. Below are highlights from the report: Revenues: Single quarter revenues in 4Q24 were $745.3 billion (B), up 9.9% YoY. That pushed annualized revenues to $2.596 trillion. Topline growth has been driven by the big 4: Alphabet, Amazon, Meta (FB) and Microsoft. For six straight quarters, all of these companies have recorded double digit revenue growth. For the 4Q24 annualized period, among larger companies, the fastest growth came from Meta, up 21.9% versus 2023, followed by Microsoft (+15.0%), Alphabet (13.9%), and Amazon (11.0%). The biggest dollar impact on growth in 4Q24 came from Amazon, as its single quarter revenues grew $17.8 billion from 4Q23 to end 4Q24 at $187.8B, up 10.5% YoY. The only curbs on growth in 4Q24 were Japanese IT services & cloud vendor Fujitsu and Chinese search specialist Baidu, both of which reported modest declines. Capex: After declining 3% in 2023, webscale capex grew at incredibly fast, unsustainable rates in 2024: up by 26%, 53%, 61%, and 78% YoY in the four quarters of the year. 4Q24 capex of $100.2B pushed the annualized total to $304.4B, up 56% YoY, and another all-time high. Investor interest in generative AI has spread rapidly, driving GPU spend in the data center. Some companies claim they are struggling to procure all the GPUs they want, and prices are unusually high, both due to NVIDIA's market power. The current investment spike would seem to be inspired by a mix of hype and fear of missing out, as GenAI brings with it a plethora of legal & regulatory risks and relative lack of proven business models. Most recent webscale capex is focused on outfitting existing data centers: from 48% of annualized capex in 2022, Network/IT and software capex was 60% of total capex in 2024. The biggest capex outlays in 4Q24 came from Amazon ($27.8B), Microsoft ($15.8B), Meta ($14.4B), and Alphabet ($14.3B). These four account for over 70% of single quarter spending. They are the reason behind the surge in the price of NVIDIA stock. Profitability: Webscale free cash flow margins averaged out to 16.3% in 2024, a bit lower than the 18.6% average of 2023. Average net profit margin for 2024 was 19.9%, a bit higher than 17.5% in 2023. Net margins are around the same level as in the year before COVID, but free cash flow margins have dropped recently due to high capex spend. Meta, Tencent and Microsoft were 1-2-3 for FCF margins in 2024 overall. The ecommerce specialists Amazon and Alibaba are the laggards, as usual. In gauging webscalers' ability to fund their capex, their recent levels of free cash flow profitability is one factor to consider. The overall level of average margins is a bit low relative to history, and it's moving in the wrong direction. Webscalers can afford this for a few quarters, but not for a few years. Employees: Headcount in the webscale market totaled to 4.23 million in December 2024, slightly up from 4.185 million in December 2023. This difference is negligible, considering the size of some of the webscalers and how quickly the ecommerce specialists in particular can change workforce levels. Total webscale headcount has been approximately 4.1 to 4.2 million or so steadily since late 2021. Some of the biggest webscalers are investing heavily in AI and GenAI, with one clear goal being to improve their internal cost efficiencies. This inevitably will mean fewer employees. Even within the ecommerce space, there is a rising use of robots and autonomous vehicles in the logistics chain. Per our latest forecast, we expect webscale employment to rise slightly in 2025 but decline thereafter due to greater use of robotics, automation and AI. Regional trends: The Asia-Pacific region has been a drag on the market for several quarters, and that continued in 4Q24. Webscale revenues in the Americas, Europe, and MEA have been growing in the low double digit range for a few quarters, but AP has been weak: 4Q24 revenue growth was 6% YoY, in line with the last few quarters of low single digit percentage growth. Weak Asian currencies and a very competitive 'big tech' market in China account for the gap. Asia should have a good 2025, though. Both Tencent and Alibaba appear to have strong government support to expand and grow tech spending over the next 2-3 years. That should help to accelerate Asian regional growth.

Title: AI's "Biggest Test" Is Turning Into a Catastrophe as CoreWeave Flounders
URL: https://futurism.com/ai-test-coreweave
Time Published: 2025-03-31T00:48:52Z
Full Content:
So far, the AI industry has enjoyed smooth sailing. It's courted billions in slap-happy investments and sign-first, read-later contracts, ballooning some Silicon Valley companies to the top of the financial food chain. Now it's facing its toughest challenge yet in the form of CoreWeave, the AI processing company that went public on the stock market this week and the first all-AI startup to do so. It was said to be a major test for the industry ‚Äî and so far it's failing, miserably. CoreWeave stocks hit the public market with a wet thud on Friday, opening at $39, down slightly from its IPO price of $40 per share, which was already reduced from the highest projection of $55 per share the previous week. The company's hopes of raising $4 billion in the offering thus fell way short at a soggy $1.5 billion. That flat opening helped spurn a rough day for the Magnificent 7 ‚Äî the term used to describe Google, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Meta, Apple, and Microsoft ‚Äî which all tumbled following announcements of Donald Trump's auto tariffs. Nvidia, the chip giant that's tried to prop up CoreWeave, saw its stock price fall 1.5 percent on Friday, after a 2.1 percent fall on Thursday. Apple, meanwhile, fell 2.5 percent, while Amazon tumbled 4.5 percent, and Tesla dived 3.7 ahead of worldwide protests aimed at CEO Elon Musk. Though CoreWeave isn't entirely to blame for the M7's terrible rotten day, its failure to instill faith in the tech industry and stave off mounting losses still feels like a big deal. The company's entire business model hinges on the mass adoption of generative AI ‚Äî a resource-intensive technology whose main impact so far has been polluting the internet with computer generated slop. If CoreWeave does well, it would be a major boost for the tech industry, kicking off even more demand for chips and a wave of AI IPOs. However, if CoreWeave can't survive despite the massive contracts it has with Microsoft, OpenAI, and Nvidia, then investors will have little reason to trust the generative AI hype going forward ‚Äî something many have questioned after the Chinese AI company DeepSeek suggested a sustainable alternative to US AI development. And unfortunately for American AI hopefuls, there's little reason to think CoreWeave can hold out the next six months, let alone lead the AI revolution. As tech critic Ed Zitron notes, CoreWeave is a company primed for disaster. Its business is far from stable, relying on those huge revenue injections over sustainable, diversified income. According to the company's financial filings, 77 percent of CoreWeave's revenue comes from just two customers ‚Äî meaning the company could collapse like a house of cards if just one of its clients cancels a contract. Meanwhile, it has what Zitron calls a "fatal amount of debt" via loans from companies like Blackstone and Magnetar. The interest alone on CoreWeave's top two loans could be as much as $1.5 billion per year thanks to some high-risk terms, suggesting a lack of faith from the company's lenders. All told, it's a pretty lame showing given all the hype we've heard from AI tycoons. The next few months will tell whether they can keep CoreWeave ‚Äî and the AI industry ‚Äî afloat as the market grows impatient with empty promises.

Title: Liberation Day: Market Implications Of Tariffs
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/03/30/liberation-day-market-implications-of-tariffs/
Time Published: 2025-03-30T12:15:52Z

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone Contributor. According to Strategas Research Partners, the size of the contemplated tariffs to be announced on ... More Wednesday could bring the total to $300 billion, or 1% of U.S. GDP. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) While the economic data was a bit softer on the margin last week, markets were likely rattled more by concerns about the upcoming tariff announcements on President Donald Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúLiberation Day,‚Äù scheduled for Wednesday, April 2. Though the range of possible outcomes is extensive, the scope and size of the tariffs should be meaningful. Goldman Sachs estimates a five-percentage-point increase in tariffs trims 1% to 2% from S&P 500 earnings growth. So, Goldman Sachs has lowered its 2025 earnings per share growth estimate to 7%. Strategas Research Partners notes that the size of the contemplated tariffs could bring the total size to $300 billion, or 1% of U.S. GDP. China, Canada, Mexico, and the European Union as a group account for almost 50% of imports in the U.S. Following COVID-19 and the last trade war, supply chains have made progress in diversifying away from China. Share Of U.S. Imports: Last 12 Months While supply chains have reduced their dependence on China, it still has the largest trade surplus with the U.S., making it likely to remain subject to significant and possibly increased tariffs. Mexico and Canada also have large trade surpluses, so they are targets. Notably, the U.S. has significant leverage with many large trading partners as their exports to the U.S. make up a large enough portion of their GDP. If sizable tariffs crimp their net exports to the U.S., as would be expected, their economic growth will suffer. The European Union has a significant trade surplus with the U.S., so they are expected to be targeted when the administration proceeds with reciprocal tariffs this week. Reciprocal tariffs are meant to place U.S. tariffs equal to those experienced by U.S. goods imported into that region. If value-added taxes are included in the reciprocal calculation by the administration, then the tariffs on the European Union will be significantly higher than if only their tariff rates are considered. Selected Countries With Large Trade Surplus With The U.S. President Trump‚Äôs use of tariffs and threats of additional tariffs has added to the policy uncertainty. Without knowing the size, duration, and cost to alternatively source the impacted imported product, it is impossible to estimate the impact of any future tariffs accurately. Furthermore, possible retaliation and the second-order effects must be considered. Generally speaking, tariffs should be a headwind to economic growth as higher prices have a tax-like impact on consumer spending. They are likely to boost inflation readings on the margin, though all the increased costs might not be passed on to consumers, and strength in the U.S. dollar could provide further offsets. As we have experienced since mid-February, all other things equal, uncertainty lowers the valuation investors are willing to pay for risk assets such as stocks. While the outcome is unclear, the Baker, Bloom, and Davis composite index of economic policy uncertainty measures policy uncertainty by examining the frequency of media references to it. U.S. Policy Uncertainty According to an analysis by Strategas Research Partners, stocks usually do quite well following periods of policy uncertainty. For example, policy uncertainty at current levels has, on average, been followed by over 20% returns from the S&P 500 in the 12 months after. The poor data typically weighs on stocks as readings worsen, but the pressure is released once past the point of maximum pessimism. Average Stock Returns During U.S. Policy Uncertainty After a 1.5% decline last week, the S&P 500 sits 9.2% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has faired worse with a plunge of 20.5% since mid-December. Market Returns The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have recently been underperforming the less economically sensitive defensive stocks. This suggests that an economic growth scare is one cause of the recent stock weakness and that stress intensified last week. While it should continue to be monitored, the relative weakness of cyclical stocks isn‚Äôt yet at levels seen before past recessions. Economically-Sensitive Versus Defensive Stocks Beyond Wednesday‚Äôs highly anticipated tariff announcements, Friday‚Äôs monthly jobs release will be an important marker. If job growth continues, there will be less concern about any drag from increased tariffs pushing the economy into recession. The March unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.1%, but growth in nonfarm payrolls and hours worked should be closely watched for signs of further softness. U.S. Unemployment Rate While the Federal Reserve projects two rate cuts, markets expect three for 2025, with the first in mid-June. These expectations could change quickly depending on this week‚Äôs releases. Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected If you own your stocks as an investment ‚Äî just like you‚Äôd own an apartment, house, or a farm ‚Äî look at them as a business. ‚Äì Warren Buffett Warren Buffett‚Äôs mentor, Benjamin Graham, taught him much about investing. Graham‚Äôs most essential lessons were to analyze stocks as a business and not react to short-term fluctuations in the quoted price of a stock. Buffett has said that chapters eight and twenty of Benjamin Graham‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Intelligent Investor‚Äù book are the bedrock of his investment process. Graham thought investors should look at stock holdings as owning a part of various businesses, like being a ‚Äúsilent partner‚Äù in a private company. Hence, stocks should be valued as a portion of the company‚Äôs intrinsic value, not as something constantly changing in price on the stock market. An investor should take advantage of the stock market‚Äôs fickle view of a company or concerns about macroeconomic factors rather than allowing it to dictate what one should do. Valuing stocks as a business and purchasing stock with a ‚Äúmargin of safety‚Äù enable investors to ignore the market‚Äôs emotional ups and downs. For Graham, the ‚Äúmargin of safety‚Äù meant buying at a price below the ‚Äúindicated or appraised value,‚Äù which should allow an investment to provide a reasonable return even if there are errors in the analysis. The recent market turmoil makes it an optimal time to revisit investment first principles. Given the growing downside risk to the economy and the current inflationary environment, investors should find comfort in owning quality companies with pricing power when searching for opportunities during any selloff. Quality is defined as high returns on capital, consistent earnings, and low debt levels, which should help the company survive a possible economic slowdown or tariff-related challenges. For example, consider Constellation Brands (STZ), which is best known for owning the rights to Corona and Modelo beers in the U.S. It also owns some wine and spirits brands, but beer accounts for about 80% of its sales. Potential tariffs on Mexico could negatively impact its beer earnings since almost all its beer is produced in Mexico. It seems unlikely that a tariff headwind will erode the long-term value of its beer brands, even if profitability could be dented in the short term. Corona and Modelo have two of the best growth profiles among beer brands, and alcohol consumption tends to remain relatively unscathed by economic downturns. Notably, there are fears that the GLP-1 diet drugs and a growing preference for cannabis could weigh on long-term alcohol consumption which could be a structural headwind. On the other hand, the stock is now selling for a multi-year low in valuation across several metrics. Constellation boasts a solid balance sheet and free cash flow generation to sustain it through a possible recession or tariff-related disruption. Just as the zenith of economic and earnings optimism in early 2025 gave way to creeping concerns about the durability of growth under pressure from possible tariff increases, maximum pessimism will eventually give way to a better reality. History tells us that better stock returns follow maximum policy uncertainty. Whether next week‚Äôs tariff announcement provides that bottom is unclear, but markets have shifted from pricing in a benign environment to a more difficult path. Current data points to an economic slowdown rather than a recession, which bodes well for reasonable returns from the correction bottom. Macroeconomic forecasting is fraught, so one should still admit that the odds of a recession have risen, and no one truly knows the eventual outcome. Though most are rightly concerned about the downside risk from tariffs, there is an upside if this pressure results in better trade terms for U.S. companies, and the tariffs can be reduced in the short term. In addition, the focus could shift to more market-friendly topics of tax cuts and deregulation. In any case, investors must always deal with uncertainty and unpredictable market volatility. Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham have provided a better blueprint for dealing with this by focusing on the health and valuation of the underlying businesses rather than the macroeconomic environment or the movement of stock prices. This focus doesn‚Äôt avoid the volatility but allows one to use it to their advantage if executed correctly. Just as Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) keeps more than enough cash to pay insurance claims without touching any stock investments, investors should have enough cash and bonds to cover short-term expenses to ignore any depressive states of the stock market and perhaps benefit from taking advantage when they invariably occur.

AI can help companies do more with less. Now, at least at Google, some employees aren't pleased about their recent compensation packages. And they're speaking out about it. Some Google employees received smaller pay bumps in their 2025 compensation packages than they anticipated, according to an exclusive report from my BI colleague Hugh Langley. Googlers raised the issue at a recent company all-hands, per a meeting transcript that Hugh obtained, where they wondered why some employees had seen a decrease in their refreshed stock grants and overall comp. A Google exec at the all-hands said some employees in less technical roles received smaller equity packages this year to calibrate pay to local markets. But the story got me thinking about how Google's lower comp fits into the changing tech industry. I spoke with Hugh about his reporting and what it means for Google. Steve: What's the reaction to your scoop? Hugh: Whenever I write about compensation, I get a lot of feedback from employees across Big Tech. I know some of these stories can have a "world's smallest violin" feeling to them ‚Äî Googlers, on the whole, are still paid very well! But in the battle for talent, this stuff really matters. What impact do you see this having on Google's workforce? The fact it got raised during the company's all-hands means it's on a lot of employees' minds. The biggest possible impact is a hit to morale, especially for employees in non-technical roles that have been dinged hardest. As the tech industry becomes more hardcore about work, how do you see Google fitting into that overall trend? Google is certainly going hardcore, but in typical Google fashion, it's doing it less dramatically, less publicly, and without any of the political chest-thumping we've seen from the likes of Meta. Googlers once felt they were the only ones safe from layoffs, but now rolling job cuts have become the new norm. It's also chopped away at management layers and in some cases set a higher bar for performance. Of course, there are plenty of employees who see this all as a good thing, but there's a feeling among many staff that the era of mollycoddling at Alphabet is well and truly over. Many assumed Elon Musk's proximity to President Donald Trump would be a net positive ‚Äî but the opposite has proven to be true. Musk's involvement with DOGE has triggered an identity crisis within Tesla. Over the years, Tesla and its CEO have faced dire predictions, but each time they seem to have emerged stronger. However, for some employees, analysts, and investors, Musk's political entanglements represent a new challenge. Why this time feels different. Also read: The business of buying and selling companies is slowing down. Buyout funds recently underperformed the stock market for the first time in decades. But that doesn't mean PE vets and newcomers have to fret. Certain opportunities are in demand, and ‚Äî if you're more junior ‚Äî there's good news for you, too. What to know about PE careers. Since CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg started calling for more "masculine energy" in the workplace, a small group of their female colleagues has been organizing their resistance. Some female executives worry that big business's latest testosterone injection could push them out of leadership roles. Others see it as galvanizing, a sign that women are making serious progress. "The masks and the gloves are off." "If a billionaire can steal from me, I can scrape a little off the top, too." That's how one person justifies stealing little treats from Whole Foods. Middle-class shoplifters and thieves of opportunity are fudging Amazon returns and sneaking Whole Foods goods to stick it to The Man ‚Äî whose name, in this case, is Jeff Bezos. The problem is that small-time swiping doesn't actually effect the change these anti-Amazon avengers want to see. Worse, it could be causing unintended harm. This week's quote: "We are catching a lot of balls, with very little people. Eventually one of them is probably going to fall." ‚Äî A NOAA employee concerned about how DOGE's job cuts at the agency will affect extreme weather alerts and air travel forecasts. More of this week's top reads: VCs are in a 'frenzy' to invest in Anduril, but good luck getting ahold of shares. The BI Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MARCH 29 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE‚Äôs theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR‚Äôs proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 ‚Äì Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI ‚Äì We attended both Nvidia Corp.‚Äôs GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.‚Äôs investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs‚Äô iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom‚Äôs first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 ‚Äì Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade ‚Äì Sell, hold or double down? ‚Äì Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood‚Äôs ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 ‚Äì Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack ‚Äì It‚Äôs been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we‚Äôve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike‚Äôs earnings print highlights the company‚Äôs impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we‚Äôll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike‚Äôs path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 ‚Äì The unplanned genius of Broadcom‚Äôs route to AI dominance ‚Äì Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn‚Äôt simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom‚Äôs Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 ‚Äì Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off ‚Äì The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed ‚Äì i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 ‚Äì $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft‚Äôs AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We‚Äôll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 ‚Äì Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty ‚Äì As an American, you can‚Äôt help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it‚Äôs a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers‚Ä¶even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel‚Äôs business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel‚Äôs strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 ‚Äì Slicing the Gordian Knot ‚Äì A leap to real time systems of truth ‚Äì In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 ‚Äì Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 ‚Äì Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true ‚Äì ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 ‚Äì 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish ‚Äì According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 ‚Äì Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps ‚Äì We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise‚Äôs operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business ‚Äì e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today‚Äôs data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business‚Äô operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today‚Äôs application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we‚Äôve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 ‚Äì Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions ‚Äì Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR‚Äôs Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 ‚Äì David vs Goliath reimagined ‚Äì OpenAI‚Äôs approach to AI supervision ‚Äì Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI‚Äôs superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI‚Äôs unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We‚Äôll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI‚Äôs characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we‚Äôll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI‚Äôs lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 ‚Äì Moving beyond separation of compute & storage‚Ä¶Journey to the 6th data platform ‚Äì We believe today‚Äôs so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today‚Äôs generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 ‚Äì re:Invent ‚Äô23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS ‚Äì Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon‚Äôs powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ‚Äô23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We‚Äôll review Amazon‚Äôs strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we‚Äôll provide commentary on the chess moves it‚Äôs making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We‚Äôll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 ‚Äì The OpenAI meltdown‚Ä¶Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy ‚Äì Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don‚Äôt quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it‚Äôs more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we‚Äôll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 ‚Äì The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 ‚Äì Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we‚Äôre seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we‚Äôll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 ‚Äì IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity ‚Äì With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 ‚Äì i.e. watsonx. IBM‚Äôs deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM‚Äôs research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We‚Äôll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 ‚Äì The Gen AI power law ‚Äì How data diversity influences adoption ‚Äì Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta‚Äôs Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure‚Äôs AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 ‚Äì AI revenue riddle ‚Äì Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? ‚Äì In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, ‚ÄúYou can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.‚Äù This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow‚Äôs statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990‚Äôs. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics‚Ä¶yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what‚Äôs happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 ‚Äì From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption ‚Äì MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he‚Äôd be disappointed if AI didn‚Äôt lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR‚Äôs Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 ‚Äì Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform ‚Äì In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we‚Äôve used the metaphor ‚ÄúUber for everyone‚Äù to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 ‚Äì Lower for longer‚Ä¶Tech spending remains tepid ‚Äì We‚Äôre getting used to the phrase, ‚Äúhigher for longer,‚Äù referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed‚Äôs tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it‚Äôs a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We‚Äôll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 ‚Äì Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in ‚Äì In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE‚Äôs Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research‚Äôs Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR‚Äôs recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 ‚Äì Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone‚Ä¶how the future of data apps will evolve ‚Äì The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about ‚ÄúUber for all.‚Äù We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 ‚Äì Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next ‚Äì George Kurtz is pumped up‚Ä¶and why not? CrowdStrike‚Äôs business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company‚Äôs products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We‚Äôll review the company‚Äôs recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we‚Äôll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 ‚Äì Copilot or competitor ‚Äì How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath‚Äôs Northstar ‚Äì UiPath‚Äôs recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We‚Äôll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate‚Äôs impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we‚Äôll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 ‚Äì Google goes all in on the AI cloud ‚Äì At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google‚Äôs messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company‚Äôs focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we‚Äôve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google‚Äôs kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We‚Äôll share ETR data that positions Google‚Äôs AI relative to other leaders and we‚Äôll contrast Google‚Äôs data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 ‚Äì Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft‚Ä¶Why Google may not be Next ‚Äì Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake‚Äôs recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company‚Äôs traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake‚Äôs aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 ‚Äì VMware‚Äôs Future ‚Äì Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom‚Äôs Wing ‚Äì The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom‚Äôs acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom‚Äôs rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We‚Äôll share current ETR survey data to place VMware‚Äôs position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week‚Äôs VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 ‚Äì Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance ‚Äì The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they‚Äôre spending more on AI this year, they‚Äôre doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we‚Äôll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 ‚Äì Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven ‚Äì After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôre pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI‚Äôs rising tide. We‚Äôll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 ‚Äì What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares ‚Äì Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft‚Äôs Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we‚Äôve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS‚Äô big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We‚Äôll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 ‚Äì AI gives cyber attackers the advantage‚Ä¶for now ‚Äì Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 ‚Äì AI meets cloud security ‚Äì and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 ‚Äì AI won‚Äôt be a winner takes all market ‚Äì The AI heard ‚Äôround the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that‚Äôs going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 ‚Äì Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack ‚Äì The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it‚Äôs unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data ‚Äì e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week‚Äôs research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance‚Ä¶and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 ‚Äì Connecting the Dots on Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud Ambitions ‚Äì Over the past several months we‚Äôve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week‚Äôs Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of ‚ÄúAll Data / All Workloads‚Äù and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake‚Äôs core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn‚Äôt mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week‚Äôs Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake‚Äôs high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we‚Äôll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 ‚Äì HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits ‚Äì HPE‚Äôs announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE‚Äôs LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company‚Äôs recent Discover conference and we‚Äôll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today‚Äôs public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 ‚Äì Uber‚Äôs architecture represents the future of data apps‚Ä¶meet its architects ‚Äì Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company‚Äôs mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company‚Äôs productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you‚Äôd find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber‚Äôs technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber‚Äôs groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We‚Äôll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 ‚Äì Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps‚Ä¶here‚Äôs our take ‚Äì Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we‚Äôll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 ‚Äì Cisco needs to simplify‚Ä¶Here‚Äôs how ‚Äì With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco‚Äôs portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco‚Äôs challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company‚Äôs mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco‚Äôs business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 ‚Äì The future of AI is real time data‚Ä¶Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines ‚Äì The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company‚Äôs value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia‚Äôs momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we‚Äôll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 ‚Äì The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud ‚Äì AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week‚Äôs post. Look past the buzz and you‚Äôll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it‚Äôs a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we‚Äôll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud‚Ä¶what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware‚Äôs future evolves. We‚Äôll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We‚Äôll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 ‚Äì Searching for gold in enterprise AI ‚Äì The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week‚Äôs Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 ‚Äì Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation ‚Äì While we‚Äôve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don‚Äôt see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We‚Äôll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we‚Äôll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 ‚Äì Don‚Äôt be fooled by slowing cloud growth‚Ä¶cost optimization is a feature not a bug ‚Äì The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don‚Äôt kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We‚Äôll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 ‚Äì RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 ‚Äì The narrative from security vendors is organizations don‚Äôt spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe‚Ä¶but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can‚Äôt hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires‚Ä¶but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week‚Äôs episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we‚Äôre excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we‚Äôll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We‚Äôll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto‚Äôs threat intelligence and response division. As well, we‚Äôll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 ‚Äì RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI ‚Äì In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We‚Äôll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we‚Äôll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 ‚Äì Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day ‚Äì On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE‚Äôs culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll share our takeaways from HPE‚Äôs event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri‚Äôs quarterly all-hands meeting. We‚Äôll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We‚Äôll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE‚Äôs market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 ‚Äì Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft ‚Äì A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week‚Äôs guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we‚Äôll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 ‚Äì Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? ‚Äì The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 ‚Äì GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms ‚Äì The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 ‚Äì Databricks faces critical strategic decisions‚Ä¶here‚Äôs why ‚Äì When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We‚Äôll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We‚Äôll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 ‚Äì MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech ‚Äì While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We‚Äôll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We‚Äôll close with the key innovation areas we‚Äôll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 ‚Äì MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business ‚Äì The world‚Äôs leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It‚Äôs become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We‚Äôll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they‚Äôre faring in the telecomms vertical. And we‚Äôll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 ‚Äì Google‚Äôs Point of View on Confidential Computing ‚Äì Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it‚Äôs just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we‚Äôll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let‚Äôs summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 ‚Äì Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 ‚Äì The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won‚Äôt abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what‚Äôs happening in cloud markets ‚Äì not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we‚Äôll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 ‚Äì Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 ‚Äì Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security ‚Äì lots to talk about there ‚Äì generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 ‚Äì ChatGPT Won‚Äôt Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage ‚Äì OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don‚Äôt believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company‚Äôs early entry into the space may not confer ‚Äúgame over‚Äù advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 ‚Äì Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps ‚Äì Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we‚Äôll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 ‚Äì CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization ‚Äì Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it‚Äôs to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data ‚Äúright‚Äù is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 ‚Äì AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive ‚Äì A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We‚Äôll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 ‚Äì Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions ‚Äì Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year‚Äôs enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 ‚Äì How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity ‚Äì Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week‚Äôs cybersecurity update. We‚Äôll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 ‚Äì Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean ‚Äì While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we‚Äôve previously reported, the CISO‚Äôs budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We‚Äôll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren‚Äôt as much. We‚Äôll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 ‚Äì re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud ‚Äì The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives ‚Äì i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud ‚Äì compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier‚Äôs annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We‚Äôll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we‚Äôll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 ‚Äì Snowflake caught in the storm clouds ‚Äì A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we‚Äôve stressed many times, the company‚Äôs management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn‚Äôt matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 ‚Äì Cloudflare‚Äôs Supercloud‚Ä¶What Multi Cloud Could Have Been ‚Äì Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine‚Äì allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company‚Äôs future. In this post, we‚Äôll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We‚Äôll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we‚Äôll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 ‚Äì Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy ‚Äì Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you‚Äôre cruising along thinking‚Ä¶ok that was weird but it‚Äôs clear sailing now‚Ä¶only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations ‚Äì including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll review the implications of this week‚Äôs earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform‚Äôs growth accelerated. We‚Äôll explain why GCP‚Äôs growth is still not fast enough. We‚Äôll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 ‚Äì Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data ‚Äì The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It‚Äôs understandable why there‚Äôs so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we‚Äôre going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 ‚Äì CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next ‚Äì This past week, we saw two of the ‚ÄúBig 3‚Äù cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today‚Äôs cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We‚Äôll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors ‚Äì Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 ‚Äì Analyst Take on Dell ‚Äì Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 ‚Äì Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend ‚Äì Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that‚Äôs clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations‚Ä¶but these levels are still well above historical norms ‚Äì so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good ‚Äì at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs‚Ä¶and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 ‚Äì As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch ‚Äì Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not‚Ä¶ the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there‚Äôs no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it‚Äôs becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can‚Äôt hide behind the macro. Which is why it‚Äôs important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum ‚Äì and relative high spending velocity on their platforms ‚Äì albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 ‚Äì UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course ‚Äì Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath‚Äôs customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company‚Äôs prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 ‚Äì How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform ‚Äì In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike‚Äôs user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 ‚Äì We Have the Data‚Ä¶What Private Tech Companies Don‚Äôt Tell you About Their Business ‚Äì The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there‚Äôs lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn‚Äôt as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you‚Äôre an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we‚Äôve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It‚Äôs called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they‚Äôre able to capture. We‚Äôve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we‚Äôre going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 ‚Äì VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey ‚Äì While the precise direction of VMware‚Äôs future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We‚Äôll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we‚Äôll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 ‚Äì What Black Hat ‚Äô22 tells us about securing the Supercloud ‚Äì Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE‚Äôs supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It‚Äôs a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they‚Äôve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We‚Äôll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We‚Äôll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 ‚Äì Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others ‚Äì At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 ‚Äì What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 ‚Äì The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network‚Ä¶essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner ‚Äì what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud‚Ä¶sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth ‚Äì i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience ‚Äì is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 ‚Äì How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s ‚Äì AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the ‚Äúfree safety‚Äù in the equation ‚Äì i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We‚Äôll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS‚Äô secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 ‚Äì AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity ‚Äì After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we‚Äôll share our view of what‚Äôs changed since our last cyber update in May, we‚Äôll look at the macro environment, how it‚Äôs impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week‚Äôs AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 ‚Äì Amping it up with Frank Slootman ‚Äì Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don‚Äôt need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It‚Äôs called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I‚Äôve read it several times and if you haven‚Äôt picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank‚Äôs philosophy. You‚Äôll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 ‚Äì Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud ‚Äì As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 ‚Äì H1 of ‚Äò22 was ugly‚Ä¶H2 could be worse‚Ä¶Here‚Äôs why we‚Äôre still optimistic ‚Äì After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 ‚Äì Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns ‚Äì Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop‚Äôs relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 ‚Äì Snowflake Summit 2022‚Ä¶All About Apps & Monetization ‚Äì Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop‚Äôs relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 ‚Äì How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard ‚Äì When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW‚Äôs stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli‚Äôs leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they‚Äôd repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn‚Äôt really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman‚Äôs track record of execution‚Ä¶and data. Good bets; but folks really didn‚Äôt appreciate that Snowflake wasn‚Äôt just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud‚Ä¶and we‚Äôve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we‚Äôll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company‚Äôs CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building ‚Äì i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar‚Äôs Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 ‚Äì MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones ‚Äì Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company‚Äôs business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 ‚Äì Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast ‚Äì In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty‚Ä¶nope‚Ä¶they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that‚Äôs inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom‚Äôs planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 ‚Äì Supercloud is becoming a thing ‚Äì Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We‚Äôve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we‚Äôve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we‚Äôve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we‚Äôve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept‚Äôs technical and business feasibility. We‚Äôll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they‚Äôre at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 ‚Äì Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? ‚Äì Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late‚Ä¶Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta‚Äôs performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company‚Äôs stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November‚Ä¶Meanwhile CyberArk‚Äôs recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal ‚Äì In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a ‚Äúgolf clap‚Äù in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World‚Ä¶ and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We‚Äôll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth‚Äôs orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe ‚Äì Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation‚Ä¶the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba‚Äôs cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we‚Äôve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We‚Äôre seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers‚Äô workloads live ‚Äì in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week‚Äôs Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We‚Äôll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what‚Äôs happening in the ‚Äúhybrid zone‚Äù of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter ‚Äì The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely ‚Äî software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we‚Äôve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we‚Äôve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 ‚Äì Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh ‚Äì The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today‚Äôs Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 ‚Äì Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think ‚Äì The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta‚Äôs response have been harsh and the impact on Okta‚Äôs value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company‚Äôs market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta‚Äôs claim that the customer technical impact was ‚Äúnear zero,‚Äù may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta‚Äôs public statements. Okta‚Äôs product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week‚Äôs Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we‚Äôll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 ‚Äì New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending ‚Äì Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we‚Äôre seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We‚Äôll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 ‚Äì Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy ‚Äì There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we‚Äôre talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government‚Äôs track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today‚Äôs policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week‚Äôs Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments‚Äô antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 ‚Äì Snowflake‚Äôs Wild Ride ‚Äì Snowflake‚Ä¶they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That‚Äôs the nature of the business isn‚Äôt it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there‚Äôs no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake‚Äôs stock since its IPO, why it‚Äôs behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 ‚Äì Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle ‚Äì Intel‚Äôs future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company‚Äôs future is in serious jeopardy. It‚Äôs the same story we‚Äôve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel‚Äôs efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today‚Äôs leading foundries and design shops. Intel‚Äôs best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck ‚Äì perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll update you on our latest assessment of Intel‚Äôs competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company‚Äôs February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 ‚Äì RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here‚Äôs What‚Äôs New ‚Äì In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 ‚Äì Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising ‚Äì The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We‚Äôll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 ‚Äì The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes ‚Äì The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS‚Äô dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled ‚ÄúKubernetes.‚Äù In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We‚Äôll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we‚Äôll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 ‚Äì What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond ‚Äì We‚Äôve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won‚Äôt be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don‚Äôt see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 ‚Äì Securing Snowflake ‚Äì The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would ‚Äúchase the chips‚Äù in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds ‚Äì and at the edge ‚Äì practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 ‚Äì Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 ‚Äì The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it‚Äôs had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we‚Äôve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what‚Äôs ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We‚Äôll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 ‚Äì Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse ‚Äì When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It‚Äôs easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it‚Äôs very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 ‚Äì Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management ‚Äì In the 2010‚Äôs, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We‚Äôve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we‚Äôve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 ‚Äì Grading our 2021 Predictions ‚Äì Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we‚Äôll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 ‚Äì Why Oracle‚Äôs Stock is Surging to an All time High ‚Äì On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle‚Äôs success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world‚Äôs most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they‚Äôre convinced Oracle‚Äôs cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll review Oracle‚Äôs most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company‚Äôs cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 ‚Äì Rise of the Supercloud ‚Äì Last week‚Äôs AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world‚Äôs most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it‚Äôs clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS‚Äô cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds‚Äì that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 ‚Äì Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary ‚Äì Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there‚Äôs a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon‚Äôs ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We‚Äôll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 ‚Äì AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum ‚Äì Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers‚Ä¶the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It‚Äôs unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don‚Äôt run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We‚Äôll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 ‚Äì Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability ‚Äì Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye ‚Äì or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called ‚Äúmodern tech stack.‚Äù Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 ‚Äì What Could Disrupt Amazon? ‚Äì Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T ‚Äì off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm ‚Äì The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley ‚Äì broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon ‚Äì has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today‚Äôs trillionaire companies. And we‚Äôll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 ‚Äì Data Mesh‚Ä¶A New Paradigm for Data Management ‚Äì Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it‚Äôs an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it‚Äôs a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 ‚Äì The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real ‚Äì It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We‚Äôve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there‚Äôs little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there‚Äôs a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It‚Äôs unlikely they can buy all that ‚Äì so they‚Äôre going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest ‚Äì between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 ‚Äì The Future of the Semiconductor Industry ‚Äì Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence‚Ä¶these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we‚Äôve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 ‚Äì UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV ‚Äì UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra‚Ä¶creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known‚Ä¶the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week‚Ä¶with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It‚Äôs also ‚ÄúFast Forwarding‚Äù as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 ‚Äì CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 ‚Äì Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR‚Äôs macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 ‚Äì How Cisco can win cloud‚Äôs ‚ÄòGame of Thrones‚Äô ‚Äì Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It‚Äôs doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco‚Äôs dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco‚Äôs portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 ‚Äì The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler ‚Äì Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital ‚Äì i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors‚Äô minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it‚Äôs our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 ‚Äì Thinking Outside the Box‚Ä¶AWS Signals a New Era for Storage ‚Äì By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS‚Äô Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day ‚Äì a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service ‚Äì and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 ‚Äì Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market ‚Äì Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren‚Äôt in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 ‚Äì Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try‚Ä¶ ‚Äì Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta‚Äôs market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 ‚Äì Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s ‚Äì Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 ‚Äì Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 ‚Äì Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year‚Äôs contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs.

Title: AI: The New Aesthetics of Fascism

New Socialist. February 9, 2025 Gareth Watkins It's embarrassing, destructive, and looks like shit: AI-generated art is the perfect aesthetic form for the far right. 15 min read Tommy Robinson tweets an image of soldiers walking into the ocean on D-Day. Britain First‚Äôs co-leader produces imagery of Muslim men laughing at sad white girls on public transport. An AI-generated song combining kitsch schlager pop with crude racial stereotypes makes it into the German top fifty and becomes number three on Spotify‚Äôs global viral chart. Benjamin Netanyahu conjures a vision of an ethnically-cleansed Gaza connected by bullet train to the equally ephemeral Neom. Keir Starmer‚Äôs Labour Party posts, then is forced to take down, a video of its policies as embodied by anthropomorphic animals. A few days later, they promised to ‚Äúmainline AI into the veins‚Äù of Britain. The right loves AI-generated imagery. In a short time, a full half of the political spectrum has collectively fallen for the glossy, disturbing visuals created by generative AI. Despite its proponents having little love, or talent, for any form of artistic expression, right wing visual culture once ranged from memorable election-year posters to ‚Äòterrorwave‚Äô. Today it is slop, almost totally. Why? To understand it, we must consider the right‚Äôs hatred of working people, its (more than) mutual embrace of the tech industry and, primarily, its profound rejection of Enlightenment humanism. The last might seem like a stretch, but bear with me. The first point is the most obvious. ‚ÄòAI‚Äô ‚Äì as embodied by large language models like ChatGPT, and largely diffusion-based image generators like DALL-E and Midjourney ‚Äì promises to make anyone who can write a single-paragraph prompt into a copywriter or graphic designer; jobs generally associated with young, educated, urban, and often left-leaning workers. That even the best AI models are not fit to be used in any professional context is largely irrelevant. The selling point is that their users don‚Äôt have to pay (and, more importantly, interact with) a person who is felt to be beneath them, but upon whose technical skills they‚Äôd be forced to depend. For relatively small groups like Britain First, hiring a full-time graphic designer to keep up with its insatiable lust for images of crying soldiers and leering foreigners would clearly be an unjustifiable expense. But surely world leaders, capable of marshalling vast state resources, could afford at the very least to get someone from Fiverr? Then again, why would they do even that, when they could simply use AI, and thus signal to their base their utter contempt for labour? For its right wing adherents, the absence of humans is a feature, not a bug, of AI art. Where mechanically-produced art used to draw attention to its artificiality ‚Äì think the mass-produced modernism of the Bauhaus (which the Nazis repressed and the AfD have condemned), or the music of Kraftwerk ‚Äì AI art pretends to realism. It can produce art the way right wingers like it: Thomas Kinkade paintings, soulless Dreamworks 3D cartoons, depthless imagery that yields only the reading that its creator intended. And, vitally, it can do so without the need for artists. Javier Milei, a prodigious user of AI-generated art, wants Argentinians to know that any of them could join the 265,000, mostly young people who have lost jobs as a result of the recession that he induced, to the rapturous praise of economic elites. He wants to signal that anyone can find themselves at the wrong end of his chainsaw, even if doing so means producing laughably bad graphics for the consumption of his 5.9 million deeply uncritical Instagram followers. On the subject of Instagram, anyone old enough to read this will also be old enough to remember when Mark Zuckerberg, and by extension the rest of Silicon Valley, was broadly perceived as liberal. ‚ÄòZuck‚Äô was even touted as the only presidential candidate who could beat Donald Trump. (It‚Äôs worth noting that as Zuckerberg has drifted to the right he has also started dressing badly, a fact which we will return to later.) But even Zuck can‚Äôt make AI happen. The weird AI-powered fake profiles that Meta deployed in 2023 were quietly mothballed six months later, and would have disappeared from history completely, had Bluesky users not found some that had escaped deletion. This appears to be the fate of all commercial AI projects: at best, to be ignored but tolerated, when bundled with something that people actually need (cf: Microsoft‚Äôs Co-pilot); at worst, to fail entirely because the technology just isn‚Äôt there. Companies can‚Äôt launch a new AI venture without their customers telling them, clearly, ‚Äúnobody wants this.‚Äù And yet they persist. Why? Class solidarity. The capitalist class, as a whole, has made a massive bet on AI: $1 trillion dollars, according to Goldman Sachs ‚Äì a figure calculated before the Trump administration pledged a further $500 billion for its ‚ÄòProject Stargate‚Äô. While previous bets on the Metaverse and NFTs didn‚Äôt pay off, their bet on cryptocurrency has paid off spectacularly ‚Äì $3.44 trillion dollars, at the time of writing, have been created, effectively out of thin air. All of the above technologies had heavy buy-in from the political right: Donald Trump co-signed an NFT project and a memecoin; the far-right, shut out of conventional banking, uses cryptocurrency almost exclusively. This isn‚Äôt just about utility, it‚Äôs about aligning themselves with the tech industry. The same is true of their adoption of AI. OpenAI is unable to make money on $200 subscriptions to ChatGPT. Goldman Sachs cannot see any justification for its level of investment. Sam Altman is subject to allegations of sexually abusing his sister. ‚ÄòSlop‚Äô was very nearly word of the year. And then, to top it all off, the open-source DeepSeek project, developed in China, wiped $1 trillion off the US stock market overnight. In other words, the AI industry now finds that it needs all the allies it can get. And it can‚Äôt afford to be picky. If the only places that people are seeing AI imagery is @BasedEphebophile1488‚Äôs verified X account ‚Äì well, at least it‚Äôs being used at all. The thinking seems to be that, if it can hang on long enough in the public consciousness, then, like cryptocurrency before it, AI will become ‚Äòtoo big to fail‚Äô. Political actors like Tommy Robinson won‚Äôt be the ones to make that call, but they can normalise its use, and Robinson certainly moves in the digital circles of people who can offer the AI industry far more concrete help. Just as we might donate to a GoFundMe, the capitalist class will provide mutual aid in the form of billions in investment, adding AI to their products, and attempting to normalise AI by using it. This process of normalisation has led to the putatively centre-left Labour government pledging vast sums to AI infrastructure. If one of the key features of the Starmerite tendency is their belief that only conservative values are truly legitimate, their embrace of AI and its aesthetics may be part of this. We have seen how sensitive the tech industry‚Äôs leaders are to criticism. Marc Andreessen‚Äôs techno-optimist manifesto, when not conferring sainthood upon deeply evil figures like Nick Land, largely consists of its writer begging the world to love him. Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs recent interview with Joe Rogan featured lengthy sections on how he does not feel validated by the press and governments. Just as when they reach out to ‚Äòcancelled‚Äô celebrities, the right is now proactively creating an alliance with the tech industry by communicating that, even if they can‚Äôt materially support companies like OpenAI, they can at least offer emotional support. We may all be good materialists, but we can‚Äôt underestimate the effects that non-material support has in creating networks within capital. No amount of normalisation and ‚Äòvalidation‚Äô, however, can alter the fact that AI imagery looks like shit. But that, I want to argue, is its main draw to the right. If AI was capable of producing art that was formally competent, surprising, soulful, then they wouldn‚Äôt want it. They would be repelled by it. There was a time when reactionaries were able to create great art ‚Äì Dostoyevsky, G.K Chesterton, Knut Hamsun, and so on ‚Äì but that time has long passed. Decades of seething hatred of the humanities have left them unable to create, or even think about, art. Art has always been in a dialectical push and pull between tradition and the avant garde: ‚Äòart is when there is a realistic picture of a landscape, or a scene from Greek mythology‚Äô versus ‚Äòa urinal can be art if an artist signs it‚Äô. The goal of the avant-garde, as their name suggests, has been to expand art‚Äôs territory, to show that Rothko‚Äôs expanses of colour, or Ono‚Äôs instructional paintings, can do what Vermeer‚Äôs portraits can, and do it just as well. There was even a time when the right partook in this, the Italian Futurists being a prime example. There were, at one point, writers like C√©line and artists like Wyndham Lewis, who not only produced great work, but developed and pushed forward the avant-garde styles of their day. Are there any serious artists on the right today who do not parlay in nostalgia for some imagined time before art was ‚Äòruined‚Äô by Jews, women, and homosexuals? Perhaps only Michel Houellebecq, and he is long past his two-book prime. Art has rules ‚Äì like the rules of the physical universe they are sufficiently flexible to allow both Chopin and Merzbow to be classed as music, but they exist, and even internet memes are subject to those rules. The most burnt-out shitpost is still part of a long tradition of outsider sloganeering stretching back through 60s comix to Dada and Surrealism. They aren‚Äôt nothing, and if they‚Äôre ugly then, often, they‚Äôre ugly in an interesting, generative way. A person made them ugly, and did so with intent. No matter how deeply avant-garde art has engaged in shock and putative nihilism, no artist, to my knowledge, has ever made art with the sole aim of harming the already vulnerable. Even the most depraved Power Electronics acts or the most shocking performances of the Viennese Actionists had something more to them than simply causing suffering for its own sake. Andy Warhol‚Äôs mass-produced art did not create enjoyment by enabling its viewers to imagine their class enemies being made unemployed. Those are the goals of AI art, and that is why it resonates with the right. If art is the establishing or breaking of aesthetic rules, then AI art, as practiced by the right, says that there are no rules but the naked exercise of power by an in-group over an out-group. It says that the only way to enjoy art is in knowing that it is hurting somebody. That hurt can be direct, targeted at a particular group (like Britain First‚Äôs AI propaganda), or it can be directed at art itself, and by extension, anybody who thinks that art can have any kind of value. It can often be playful ‚Äì in the way that the cruel children of literary clich√© play at pulling the wings off flies ‚Äì and ironised; Musk‚Äôs Nazi salute partook of a tradition of ironic-not-ironic appropriation of fascist iconography that winds its way through 4Chan (Musk‚Äôs touchpoint) and back into the countercultural far right of the 20th century. I would not be the first to observe that we are in a new phase of reaction, something probably best termed ‚Äòpostmodern conservatism‚Äô. The main effect of this shift has been to enshrine acting like a spoilt fifteen-year-old boy as the organising principle of the reactionary movement. Counter-enlightenment thought, going back to Burke and de Maistre, has been stripped of any pretence of being anything but a childish tantrum backed up by equally childish, playground-level bullying. It is, and has always been, ‚Äúirritable mental gestures which seek to resemble ideas,‚Äù and to ‚Äòpost-liberal‚Äô ‚Äòintellectuals‚Äô, that is in fact a good thing ‚Äì if anything, they believe, the postmodern right needs to become more absurd; it needs to abandon Enlightenment ideals like reason and argumentation altogether.1 The right wing intellectual project is simply to ask: ‚Äòwhat would have to be true in order to justify the terrible things that I want to do?‚Äô The right wing aesthetic project is to flood the zone ‚Äì unsurprisingly, given their scatological bent, with bullshit ‚Äì in order to erode the intellectual foundations for resisting political cruelty. Truth does not set you free. Once you know that 2+2=4, that the administrative capital of the Netherlands is The Hague and not Amsterdam, or that immigration is a net economic positive for Britain, then you are forever bound to that truth. Your world has become, in some respects, smaller, your options diminished. If it would be more enjoyable ‚Äì because this is, at the end of the day, about enjoyment ‚Äì to create your own truth then you are out of luck. Combine truths with a concern for human life and thriving, and suddenly rules start to proliferate: we have established the truth that heating milk reduces the bacteria and viruses in it that can harm human beings, which is undesirable to us, therefore we must heat all milk that is sold. A lot of people are fine with this, accepting small impositions on their freedom in the name of the greater freedom from disease. Some are not. There is no reason, of course, that any rule made in the name of Enlightenment humanism should be necessarily good: liberal politics, Labour‚Äôs current mania for austerity, or the interminable justifications for the Iraq war, are often framed as being based on reason and humanism while being anything but. If you‚Äôve been subject to computer-says-no rules governing your access to the basic necessities of life, then you‚Äôll know how easy it is to disguise arbitrary and highly politicised whims as laws of nature, as ironclad as A = œÄ r¬≤. The application of rationality and compassion in the real world brings to mind the (likely apocryphal) Ghandi quote about Western civilisation: ‚ÄúI think it would be a good idea.‚Äù The right is a libidinal formation; it is, for many of its proponents, especially those who aren‚Äôt wealthy enough to materially benefit from it, a structure in which to have fun. A hobby, almost. Sartre‚Äôs injunction to remember that antisemites are primarily ‚Äúamusing themselves‚Äù2 is true of most ‚Äì perhaps all ‚Äì right wing discourse, no matter how serious it seems or how terrible its real-world effects. As such, the right are strongly averse to any sort of reality-testing. It is, to them, beside the point whether anything they say stands up to the tests developed by the sciences and humanities, including those which determine (insofar as such a determination can be made) whether a piece of art is ‚Äògood‚Äô, or at least serious. When they do invoke objectivity, it is misplaced, and as deeply na√Øve as their artistic output, premising their objection to the existence of trans people on ‚Äòbasic biology‚Äô, when not only can biology not define ‚Äòwoman‚Äô, it is having difficulty deciding what a fish or vegetable is. Serious engagement with the world as it is ‚Äì with the facts that emphatically don‚Äôt care about your feelings ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt often, if ever, yield the simple explanations that the right require. In the face of this complexity, most people will conclude that it is best to be humble: What is a woman? No idea, don‚Äôt really care, but let‚Äôs act in a way that causes the least suffering. But the right seem incapable of doing this. Despite all their absurdist posturing, they struggle to come to terms with a contradictory world that does not conform to their pre-decided categories. They want to assert, simultaneously, that unambiguous laws govern all aspects of being, while acting as though ‚Äòtruth‚Äô is whatever they want or need it to be at any given moment. Gender revanchism is one of the main organising principles of the postmodern right, and much everyday AI usage demonstrates a particularly gendered form of cruelty: deepfake nudes, AI ‚Äògirlfriends‚Äô used as a rhetorical cudgel to show real women that they are being replaced, AI ‚Äòart‚Äô of Taylor Swift being sexually assaulted. It‚Äôs no coincidence that the internet‚Äôs largest directory of deepfakes uses Donald Trump as a mascot. These attitudes are reflected in the upper echelons of the tech and AI industry. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman ‚Äì the man we are being told is a generational talent, a revolutionary, on a par with Steve Jobs or Bill Gates ‚Äì is also, allegedly, a rapist and paedophile, who considered his own sister his sexual property since she was three years old, and who responded to allegations by lamenting that ‚Äúcaring for a family member who faces mental health challenges is incredibly difficult.‚Äù A love of sexual violence is a key part of the identity of the contemporary right, and it is no coincidence that, the further right one goes, the more likely one is to encounter open celebration of rape and, particularly, paedophilia. Altman‚Äôs legal trouble will, for many on the right, only confirm that he is one of them. Meanwhile, on the Joe Rogan podcast, Mark Zuckerberg described the tech industry as ‚Äúculturally neutered‚Äù and called for more ‚Äúmasculine energy‚Äù and ‚Äúaggression‚Äù. Let‚Äôs return to Zuckerberg‚Äôs clothing. It was he that established the ubiquitous ‚Äògrey hoodie‚Äô style for tech CEOs. But recently he has begun to exhibit a new style. Oversized t-shirts emblazoned with ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs either Zuck or Nothing‚Äô in Latin, the unwieldy lines of his Meta AI glasses, a gaudy and unnecessary gold chain. This isn‚Äôt taking risks with fashion, like Rick Owens or Vivienne Westwood. It‚Äôs just ugly and stupid. Zuckerberg is also significantly more muscular than he used to be, despite doing nothing in his life that would seem to require a bodybuilder physique. I don‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs a coincidence that, as he embraces corporate incelism and AI, he has felt liberated to ignore what does and doesn‚Äôt look good, choosing instead to display that he is wealthy and powerful enough to look terrible if he wants. All the emperor has to do, when the child laughs at his nudity, is ignore them. Trump‚Äôs haircut, which we all seem to have become inured to, serves the same purpose. It looks like shit and that‚Äôs the point. It is a display of power and a small act of cruelty. AI is a cruel technology. It replaces workers, devours millions of gallons of water, vomits CO2 into the atmosphere, propagandises exclusively for the worst ideologies, and fills the world with more ugliness and stupidity. Cruelty is the central tenet of right wing ideology. It is at the heart of everything they do. They are now quite willing to lose money or their lives in order to make the world a crueller place, and AI is a part of this ‚Äì a mad rush to make a machine god that will liberate capital from labour for good. (This is no exaggeration: there is a lineage from OpenAI‚Äôs senior management back to the Lesswrong blog, originator of the concept of Roko‚Äôs Basilisk.) Moreso even than cryptocurrency, AI is entirely nihilistic, with zero redeeming qualities. It is a blight upon the world, and it will take decades to clear up the mountains of slop it has generated in the past two or three years. AI is, unfortunately, a fever that will have to burn itself out. It may be the case that, like cryptocurrency, elites are simply so invested in this technology that, despite its total lack of utility, they will keep trying to make it happen. Given how great a fit it is for them psychologically, I would say that this is more likely to happen than not. However, as we saw in those two brief weeks of last year‚Äôs US election campaign, the right wing psyche is incredibly fragile. For some reason, they are able to process any inversion of empirical reality, but are acutely sensitive to being laughed at. Calling them weird absolutely works, and telling them their sole artistic output looks like shit also works. Laughing at people who treat AI art as in any way legitimate works. Talking about AI‚Äôs environmental impact or its implications for the workforce will not work - they like that, it makes them feel dangerous. Instead of talking about taking money from artists, talk about how it makes them look cheap. If hurting and offending people is part of the point, then we can take that fun away from them by refusing to express hurt or offence, even if we feel it. Technological progress isn‚Äôt linear, and it‚Äôs not wholly undemocratic. We, ordinary people, stopped Google Glass from being widely released because we mocked its users, calling them ‚Äòglassholes‚Äô. The Cybertruck ‚Äì itself a work of anti-art that could only be the product of a mind addled by the far right ‚Äì failed, largely because it is embarrassing to be seen in one. We have already seen that the AI industry is vulnerable ‚Äì it was possible for Chinese grad students to build the same thing for a fraction of the price, calling into question the entire model of growth through massive investment in data centres. The left is powerless across much of society, but a training in ruthless criticism of all that exists has made us masters of negativity, while always keeping one eye on the better world that is possible when the slop has been cleared away. Our most effective weapons against AI, and the right wing that has adopted it, may not be strikes, boycotts or the power of dialectics. They might be replying ‚Äúcringe,‚Äù ‚Äúthis sucks,‚Äù and ‚Äúthis looks like shit.‚Äù There are, of course, important left critiques of those values, and of the European Enlightenment project itself. These are not the same as the revanchism of the right. ‚Ü© Jean-Paul Sartre. [1948] 1995. Anti-Semite and Jew. Translated by George J Becker. New York: Schocken, p.20.

According to Musk, the merger values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion. Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion in April 2022. By October 2024, Fidelity Investments adjusted the valuation of its stake in X, estimating the company‚Äôs overall value to be approximately $9.4 billion. Though its valuation had recovered somewhat by December 2024, it was still down a whopping 77% from Musk‚Äôs purchase price. How Musk arrived at a $33 billion valuation, in other words, would make for interesting reading. @xAI has acquired @X in an all-stock transaction. The combination values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion ($45B less $12B debt). Since its founding two years ago, xAI has rapidly become one of the leading AI labs in the world, building models and data centers at‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 28, 2025 Already the head of several companies, including SpaceX and Tesla, Musk launched xAI in July 2023, a year after purchasing Twitter. While he said the goal of xAI was to ‚Äúunderstand reality,‚Äù an ongoing feud with former business partner OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was also a driving factor. ‚ÄúToday, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution, and talent. This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI‚Äôs advanced AI capability and expertise with X‚Äôs massive reach,‚Äù Musk wrote on X Friday. ‚ÄúThe combined company will deliver smarter, more meaningful experiences to billions of people while staying true to our core mission of seeking truth and advancing knowledge.‚Äù Calling X ‚Äúthe digital town square,‚Äù Musk said the platform boasted over 600 million active users. However, Meta, which launched a rival social media platform, Threads, in July 2023, and Bluesky, which launched in February of that year, have been trying to woo away users. Bluesky's user count surpassed 27.44 million users in January 2025, many of whom had left Twitter after Musk‚Äôs takeover. At the same time, bolstered by its connections to Facebook and Instagram, Threads had over 320 million monthly active users as of February 2025. Musk made headlines in July of last year when it was revealed that Grok would be trained on X user data. The setting can be disabled, but is on by default for user accounts. Some social media users jeered today‚Äôs announcement, mocking the apparently sizable valuation boost in a deal between two of Musk's own companies. ‚ÄúI also sold my 2008 Honda Accord to myself for $1 million,‚Äù New York Times tech reporter Ryan Mac said on Bluesky. ‚ÄúWait a min‚Ä¶what‚Äôs different though‚Ä¶ other than on paper?‚Äù an X user asked. Congratulations to @elonmusk on xAI's acquisition of X. Not even we could have predicted this! pic.twitter.com/6d0ao7h3ci ‚Äî Polymarket (@Polymarket) March 28, 2025 The merger, however, could serve a more pragmatic purpose. With X still carrying significant debt‚Äî$12 billion, according to Musk's tweet‚Äîfolding it into the xAI umbrella could give the company access to new investors, improved valuation, and a narrative pivot away from Twitter‚Äôs chaotic takeover. ‚ÄúThis will allow us to build a platform that doesn‚Äôt just reflect the world but actively accelerates human progress,‚Äù he said.

March 28, 2025 18:07 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, March 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On March 27, 2025, investors in AppLovin (NASDAQ: APP) saw the price of their shares drop $65.92, wiping out about $20 billion of the company‚Äôs market value, after prominent short seller Muddy Waters Research revealed its short position in the stock. Muddy Waters‚Äô report comes on the heels of a recently filed securities class action lawsuit, captioned Quiero v. AppLovin Corporation, et al., No. 4:25-cv-02294 (N.D. Cal.). The suit seeks to represent investors who purchased AppLovin securities between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. Hagens Berman is investigating the claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 ‚Äì Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Recent Development: On March 27, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a scathing report titled ‚ÄúAppLovin: Deep Data Analysis Shows APP is Just Another Scammy AdTech Company.‚Äù The report‚Äôs focus is in part on ‚Äúretargeting‚Äù (a strategy that aims to re-engage potential customers who have previously interacted with a brand), ‚Äúincrementality‚Äù (the additional or incremental lift in sales or conversions that a marketing activity generates), and AppLovin‚Äôs compliance with third party platforms‚Äô TOS (terms of service). Muddy Waters contends that ‚ÄúAPP e-commerce is Mostly Retargeting, Incrementality is Low, and it Clearly Violates Platforms‚Äô TOS.‚Äù Muddy Waters alleges that: AppLovin Corporation (APP) Securities Class Action: The Muddy Waters report follows the filing of a securities class action complaint alleging AppLovin made false and misleading statements, while failing to disclose critical details about its flagship AXON 2.0 digital advertising platform. The company had heavily promoted the platform as "the best and fastest-growing product we‚Äôve ever released." Investors were allegedly led to believe that the platform, which reportedly leverages ‚Äúcutting-edge AI technologies,‚Äù would redefine the digital advertising landscape by enhancing ad placement efficiency and expanding into e-commerce and web-based marketing. However, the alleged narrative first shifted on February 26, 2025, when short sellers Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research published damaging reports that raised pointed questions about the company‚Äôs claims. Both research firms accused AppLovin of misleading investors regarding the platform's true capabilities and ethical practices. Fuzzy Panda Research alleged that the company violated app store policies by exploiting user data in questionable ways, predicting that tech giants Apple and Google would ban AppLovin from their app stores. Additionally, they accused AppLovin of ‚Äústealing data from Meta‚Äù as part of its e-commerce initiatives, foreseeing swift retaliation from Meta. Culper Research criticized the company for allegedly using AXON 2.0 as little more than a promotional facade to obscure the real drivers behind its business strategy. Culper's report further claimed that AppLovin's growth in mobile gaming has relied on ‚Äúsystematic exploitation of app permissions that enable advertisements themselves to force-feed silent, backdoor app installations onto users‚Äô phones, with just a single click ‚Äì an event that is often inadvertent thanks to the Company‚Äôs notorious UX gimmicks‚Äù and that ‚Äúeach illicit install translates directly to profit.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe are investigating claims that AppLovin may have misled investors about whether its growth may be attributable to illegitimate conduct,‚Äù said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Title: CoreWeave Cofounder Discusses Cloud AI Firm‚Äôs IPO, Biggest Of 2025

ByPhoebe Liu ByPhoebe Liu Forbes Staff. CoreWeave cofounders Brian Venturo (chief strategy officer), Michael Intrator (CEO) and Brannin McBee (chief development officer), from left to right. CoreWeave made its public market debut on Friday with the first big IPO of 2025. The company, which rents cloud computing power to customers that need it for AI applications, exploded onto the scene over the last couple of years. On Friday, its stock closed around $40 per share, the same as its pricing and slightly above its opening $39 per share‚Äîimplying a valuation of $23 billion on a fully diluted basis (accounting for outstanding options and restricted stock). ‚ÄúGod, like, what a crazy thing to accomplish. I‚Äôve been shoulder to shoulder with some of the most amazing people on the planet executing for the last seven years,‚Äù gushed cofounder and Chief Development Officer Brannin McBee in an interview with Forbes on Friday. ‚ÄúAt the same time, it‚Äôs the quintessential ‚Äòthis is the beginning‚Äô statement. ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just another day at CoreWeave.‚Äù In one way it was: the cloud computing company, which initially aimed to raise between $2.3 billion and $2.7 billion ended up pricing its shares at $40, well below its target of $47 to $55. As such, the company raised less money ($1.5 billion) and at a lower valuation than they‚Äôd aimed for, per documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In fact its valuation of $23 billion is almost exactly what it was when it sold shares in a private transaction in October 2024, according to the company‚Äôs initial public offering prospectus filed in early March. It was based on that information that Forbes declared the three founders and one board member all billionaires in early March. CEO Michael Intrator, Chief Strategy Officer Brian Venturo and McBee own 11%, 7% and 5% of CoreWeave‚Äôs shares, respectively, while board member Jack Cogen owns 4%. After factoring in the stock they sold while CoreWeave was still a private company, Forbes estimates that Intrator is now worth $2.7 billion, Venturo is worth $1.7 billion, McBee is worth $1.3 billion, and Cogen is worth $1 billion; those net worths are actually down more than 10% apiece than when we first estimated their fortunes, due to the lower pricing. A spokesperson for CoreWeave did not respond to a request for comment on the cofounders‚Äô net worths. ‚ÄúI think we raised exactly what we needed for the business,‚Äù McBee says. ‚ÄúPricing discovery is hard. Pricing discovery is harder in market volatility. But what you‚Äôre looking at today is a business with immense value and immense investor interest.‚Äù CoreWeave is in many ways a poster child of the exponentially growing appetite for computing power for the AI boom. In 2017, the then-commodity traders Intrator, Venturo and McBee started Atlantic Crypto, using Nvidia chips they‚Äôd stockpiled to mine cryptocurrency. Two years later, they renamed it CoreWeave and shifted the business model to building data centers and selling computing power to companies that didn‚Äôt have enough of their own GPU servers‚Äìstorage systems comprised of electronic circuits called graphics processing units. After OpenAI released ChatGPT in 2022 and unleashed something of an AI firestorm, CoreWeave‚Äôs customers were, increasingly, AI companies. Now, according to the company‚Äôs new filing, CoreWeave‚Äôs biggest customers are Microsoft, IBM, Meta, NVIDIA and billion-dollar AI labs Cohere and Mistral. Still, investors expressed concerns about CoreWeave‚Äôs dependence on these large customers (with $10-billion-plus, multi-year deals with OpenAI and Microsoft; the latter generated more than 60% of CoreWeave‚Äôs 2024 revenue), heavy net losses ($860 million on $1.92 billion in revenue in 2024) and debt-reliant financing. The OpenAI deal, a $12 billion contract announced on March 10, complements OpenAI‚Äôs ‚Äúcommercial deals with Microsoft and Oracle, and our joint venture with Softbank on Stargate,‚Äù CEO Sam Altman wrote in a press release‚Äîreferring to a $500 billion partnership aiming to secure American AI supremacy. McBee isn‚Äôt worried. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bit of a self-reinforcing mechanism,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre helping the biggest companies grow, they‚Äôre just going to get bigger.‚Äù Between glances out the window, he adds that CoreWeave plans to target slightly smaller customers to diversify their customer base. On CoreWeave‚Äôs path to profitability, McBee is confident that the company‚Äôs contracts will pay off infrastructure costs in less than three years. Also up in the air, of course, is whether demand will continue to grow. It‚Äôs expensive to build data centers, and CoreWeave has 32 of them running more than 250,000 GPUs as of the end of 2024‚Äîand plans to continue expanding long-term. CoreWeave is certainly betting that it will. In late 2024, for example, CoreWeave signed a 15-year, $4.5 billion agreement with crypto company Galaxy to lease their data center in west Texas. Regardless of where CoreWeave‚Äôs share price ends up, the cofounders have nothing to worry about‚Äîfinancially speaking. They have cashed out more than the typical pre-IPO founder does: the three cofounders and Cogen each sold more than $150 million of CoreWeave‚Äôs shares (before taxes) as part of private market sales in 2023 and 2024. McBee says the cofounders intend to stay at CoreWeave for the foreseeable future. ‚ÄúWe are the long-term management team,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe have so much to build.‚Äù

Title: A quality improvement initiative to increase HIV post-exposure prophylaxis treatment for emergency department patients after sexual assault: A pre-post study
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0320690

Many emergency department (ED) patients after a sexual assault face barriers to receiving HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). We implemented a quality improvement initiative which updated the sexual assault electronic health record (EHR) template and made available free, full-course PEP treatment packs for use at provider discretion. The aim of this study was to compare the receipt of HIV PEP for ED patients receiving sexual assault care before and after the initiative. This was a retrospective, quasi-experimental, pre-post study of all ED patients who completed a sexual assault examination between June 1, 2022 ‚Äì January 31, 2023 (pre-intervention) and March 1, 2023 ‚Äì October 31, 2023 (post-intervention). An odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to determine the initiative‚Äôs effect on PEP prescribing. Multivariable logistic regression models estimated the independent effect of the initiative while controlling for potential confounders. Of the 235 sexual assault examinations, 117 (49.8%) were during the pre-intervention and 118 (50.2%) were during the post-intervention periods. Pre-intervention, the mean age was 33.0 years (standard deviation [SD] 12.3), 94.0% were female, 30.8% Black, 31.6% Latinx, and 28.2% White. Post-intervention, the mean age was 29.2 years (SD 12.6), 90.7% were female, 42.4% Black, 28.8% Latinx, and 17.8% White. Patients were more likely to receive HIV PEP post-intervention (33/118, 28.0%) than pre-intervention (11/117, 9.4%) (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.8 to 7.8). The independent effect of the initiative on HIV PEP prescribing remained significant after controlling for demographics (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.6 to 8.0), assault characteristics (OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.6 to 11.1), and provider experience (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.7 to 7.5). The availability of HIV PEP treatment packs plus a modification to the EHR template led to a significant increase in the provision of HIV PEP for ED patients after sexual assault.

This conflict does not alter our adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. United States (US) emergency departments (ED) provide care to tens of thousands of patients after sexual assault each year [1‚Äì3]. This care includes providing trauma-informed medical and forensic examinations, screening for sexually transmitted infections (STI), and initiating post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for STIs, including the initiation of HIV PEP [4‚Äì6]. HIV PEP, the use of antiretroviral medications after a single high-risk event (such as may occur with sexual assault), is highly effective in preventing HIV seroconversion if taken as soon as possible after the exposure (within 72 hours) and with strict adherence to a 28-day regimen [7]. The risk of HIV transmission after sexual assault is not known but felt to be low, with the per-act risk of HIV seroconversion extrapolated from consensual vaginal (0.08%) and receptive rectal intercourse (1.38%) [7,8]. Because of this, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend HIV PEP to be considered on a case-by-case basis and after an assessment of assault-related factors that might increase the risk of HIV exposure and transmission. These factors include the likelihood that the assailant has HIV (is a man who has sex with other men or uses injection drugs) or exposure characteristics (did rectal or vaginal penetration occur or were mucosal injuries sustained) [7,9‚Äì11]. For many patients in whom HIV PEP is indicated after a sexual assault, receiving PEP in a timely manner and accessing a full treatment course remains a significant barrier [12]. A national survey of nearly 600 US EDs showed that only 65.3% of EDs offered HIV testing and HIV PEP to patients receiving care after a sexual assault [13]. Even when EDs routinely provide HIV testing and HIV PEP after sexual assault, initial compliance with PEP depends on the ability of a patient to first obtain the prescription, which can be impeded by limited access to pharmacies and cost. And for patients who just survived sexual assault, making a separate trip to an outpatient pharmacy may be emotionally triggering and further hinder the ability to obtain medications [12]. To circumvent these barriers, the standard practice for ED HIV PEP delivery in the US is to provide a first dose of an FDA-approved regimen while the patient is still in the ED followed by a prescription for the remaining 27 days [14]. To facilitate short term compliance, some EDs will provide patients with a 3-5 day bridging starter pack in conjunction with a standard prescription [15‚Äì17]. Providing the entire 28-day PEP medication supply at the initial visit is another strategy to increase the likelihood of adherence, especially when patients face difficulties returning for follow-up visits [18]. A recent study by Cherabie et al demonstrated an innovative model where 87% of patients at risk for HIV acquisition after sexual assault were provided a full 28-day, meds-in-hand, supply of HIV PEP [19]. In February of 2023, at the Alameda Health System (AHS), Highland Hospital ED, we implemented a quality improvement initiative, ‚Äúsexual assault PEP‚Äù (SA PEP), to increase the receipt of HIV PEP for sexual assault patients. The initiative included two interventions: 1) a modification to the sexual assault electronic health record (EHR) template to include a field prompting examiners to discuss PEP and 2) making available free 28-day supplies of meds-in-hand HIV PEP therapy (PEP treatment packs) for use at the discretion of the sexual assault examiners. The purpose of this study was to compare the receipt of HIV PEP for ED patients receiving sexual assault care in the period before (pre-intervention) and after the SA PEP initiative (post-intervention). This was a retrospective, quasi-experimental pre-post study of a quality improvement initiative. We included all ED patients who completed a sexual assault examination between June 1, 2022 ‚Äì January 31, 2023 (pre-intervention period) and March 1, 2023 ‚Äì October 31, 2023 (post-intervention period). We chose this time period based on a consensus agreement among authors that 8 months was a reasonable duration of time to observe both an effect and sustainability of the intervention. The initiative was rolled out in February 2023, which served as a one-month washout period. Patients receiving a sexual assault examination during February 2023 were therefore excluded. We also excluded patients for whom PEP was not indicated (either because they were living with HIV infection or presented ‚â•72 hours after the assault) or who were transferred from an outside facility and received a first dose of PEP as well as a 28-day prescription by the transferring hospital. The AHS Institutional Review Board approved the study with a waiver of written informed consent. This study was performed in the ED at Highland Hospital in Oakland, California, a level-1 trauma center with an annual census of 57,000 visits. The ED supports a well-established routine HIV screening program and provides rapid antiretroviral therapy (ART) using Biktarvy¬Æ (bictegravir, emtricitabine, tenofovir alafenamide) starter packs (donated by Gilead, Sciences) to eligible patients [20]. The Highland Hospital ED serves as the county referral center for sexual assault forensic examinations. At the Highland Hospital ED, sexual assault forensic examinations are conducted by the department‚Äôs pool of 20 advanced practice providers (APP) who have specialized training in conducting forensic examinations, with support from a sexual assault patient advocate. Forensic assault examinations are performed within 5 days of the assault, after approval by the responsible law enforcement agency, and with the consent of the patient. The Highland ED performs approximately 180 sexual assault examinations each year, accounting for 75% of the sexual assault examinations in Alameda County for patients ‚â• 14 years of age. Using a structured template, a written log with basic patient information and characteristics of the assault is completed by the APP and maintained in a locked cabinet in the sexual assault examiners‚Äô office. Prior to the SA PEP initiative, the protocol for ED HIV PEP was Truvada¬Æ (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) plus Tivicay¬Æ (dolutegravir) or Isentress¬Æ (raltegravir) for eligible patients presenting within 72 hours after sexual assault [21]. Eligibility for HIV PEP was based on the clinical judgment of the treating APP and was not strictly mandated. By protocol, patients were given the first doses of HIV PEP (available in the ED pyxis) as soon as possible during the index visit and then prescribed a complete course of treatment upon discharge (28 days total). Additionally, APPs could use an EHR ‚Äúsexual assault‚Äù template to facilitate accurate and comprehensive documentation of encounters for sexual assault. In January of 2023, an internal review of pharmacy records identified low numbers of ED HIV PEP prescriptions and potential missed opportunities for PEP among patients evaluated after sexual assault. This prompted a meeting between the ED Director of HIV Screening (DAEW) and the APPs to discuss barriers to prescribing PEP. Citing concerns that prescriptions often go unfilled because of pharmacy copays, lack of insurance coverage, and patient difficulties accessing outpatient pharmacies for PEP, the APPs requested approval to use the Biktarvy¬Æ starter packs for HIV PEP after sexual assault. They also requested improving the sexual assault EHR template to include a field ‚Äúreminding‚Äù them to assess HIV PEP eligibility. The decision to expand the indications of Biktarvy¬Æ to PEP for sexual assault patients was approved from the Division Chief of HIV Medicine, the HIV clinical pharmacy lead, and backed by recommendations of the East Bay Getting to Zero collaborative that included Biktarvy¬Æ as one of three preferred HIV PEP regimens [22]. A modification to the sexual assault template included the addition of embedded fields reminding providers to 1) discuss the risks and benefits of PEP and 2) document whether PEP was given. On February 15, 2023, the APPs were notified at a departmental staff meeting and by email that Biktarvy¬Æ starter packs could be used for HIV PEP for sexual assault patients at their discretion. APPs were instructed to obtain baseline laboratory testing to ensure the safe use of Biktarvy¬Æ, which included having liver function tests < 5 times the upper limit of normal, an estimated glomerular filtration rate > 30 mL/min, and a negative pregnancy test. APPs were instructed to provide eligible patients with 4 starter packs, equaling a 28-day course of PEP (each starter pack consisted of a labeled, sealed bottle containing 7 tablets). This was referred to as an HIV PEP treatment pack. If desired, standard PEP prescriptions using any FDA-recommended regimen could be provided instead of the Biktarvy¬Æ treatment packs. Eligibility for HIV PEP remained unchanged, based on the clinical judgment of the treating APP, and was not strictly mandated. The primary outcome measure was the number and proportion of patients undergoing sexual assault examinations who were provided PEP in the pre-intervention compared with the post-intervention period. The sexual assault database was used by trained research staff to identify all sexual assault forensic examinations completed between June 1, 2022, through October 31, 2023. Using a structured data collection instrument, patient level data for each forensic examination were abstracted from a review of the EHR (Epic Systems). The instrument had both closed response and free text fields. Data included patient demographics (age, gender, race, ethnicity), discharge time, treating APP, assault characteristics (type of penetration, condom use), whether PEP was offered and provided, and details of any PEP prescription or treatment pack given, including medication type and duration. Data was accessed for research purposes on 11/9/2023, 11/20/2023, 11/29/2023, 3/21/2024, and 3/22/2024. The authors had access to information that could identify individual participants during and after data collection. Study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at the AHS [23,24]. REDCap is a secure web application for building and managing online surveys and databases. Receipt of PEP was defined as EHR documentation that an HIV PEP prescription was electronically signed by the treating provider or an HIV PEP treatment pack was given. Patients that received only a first dose of HIV PEP while in the ED, but no additional prescription or treatment pack, were not considered as being provided HIV PEP. Incorrect PEP treatment (PEP prescribing errors) was defined as either an incorrect PEP regimen (inadequate treatment, such as Truvada¬Æ only) or an incorrect duration of treatment (total duration fewer than 28 days). Correct PEP treatment was defined as a 28-day prescription of an approved HIV PEP regimen. Risk of HIV acquisition from the sexual assault was defined as high (condomless receptive rectal or vaginal sex), moderate (condomless insertive rectal or vaginal sex), and low (insertive or receptive oral sex, exposure to blood, saliva, urine, sex with a condom) according to Pacific AIDS Education and Training Center Criteria [22]. APPs were categorized as high, moderate, or low volume examiners based on the number of sexual assault examinations performed during the study period. Categories were determined posteriori and based on tertiles of completed sexual assault examinations. Descriptive statistics were computed for all variables. Continuous variables were reported as medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) and means with standard deviations (SD) and categorical variables as proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CI), where appropriate. An odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI were calculated to determine the effect of the SA PEP initiative on PEP prescribing for sexual assault patients. Posteriori, three multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the independent effect of the SA PEP initiative while controlling for potential confounders. Model 1 controlled for patient characteristics (age, gender, race/ethnicity), model 2 controlled for assault characteristics (assailant known, risk of HIV risk exposure, discharge time), and model 3 controlled for number of sexual assault examinations performed by APPs. Statistical analyses were performed on de-identified data with Stata (version 14; StataCorp). Between June 1, 2022, and October 31, 2023, 279 patients aged ‚â• 14 years underwent 288 sexual assault examinations. Of these, 53 encounters were excluded from the analysis because they occurred during the month of February 2023 (N = 23), were patients living with HIV (N = 7), received PEP at a different facility prior to transfer (N = 8), or presented ‚â• 72 hours after the assault (N = 15), leaving 235 sexual assault encounters in the study population. Of the 235 sexual assault examinations, 117 (49.8%) were during the pre-intervention period and 118 (50.2%) were during the post-intervention period (Fig 1). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0320690.g001 Overall, the mean patient age was 31.1 years (SD + /-12.5 years); 217 (92.3%) were female; 86 (36.6%) were Black, 54 (23.0%) were White, and 71 (30.2%) were Latinx. One hundred nineteen (50.6%) assaults were by a known assailant and 127 (54.0%) were documented as being at a high risk for HIV exposure. One hundred and eleven (61.3%) of the sexual assault examinations were completed by high-volume APP examiners (‚â•15 examinations). Only 31.1% of sexual assault patients were discharged during daytime hours (7am-3pm). Although patients in the pre-intervention period were slightly older than those in the post-intervention period(mean age 33.0 years, SD + /-12.3 years vs. mean age 29.2 years, SD + /- 2.6 years, P = 0.02), there did not appear to be any clinically meaningful differences in characteristics between the study periods (Table 1). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0320690.t001 Use of the sexual assault template was similar between the study periods (pre-intervention: 98/117, 83.8%; post-intervention: 101/118, 85.6%, P = 0.70). Documentation of offering HIV PEP was infrequently recorded in the pre-intervention period (14/117, 12.0%) compared to the post-intervention period(91/118, 77.1%) (P < 0.0001). During the pre-intervention period, 11 of the 117 patients completing sexual assault examinations (9.4%) were provided PEP compared to 33 of the 118 patients (28.0%) during the post-intervention period (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.8 to 7.8) (Table 2). Of the 33 patients receiving PEP during the post-intervention period, 22 (66.7%) received treatment packs and 11 (33.3%) received a prescription. Prescribing errors occurred with 3 (13.6%) of the 22 PEP prescriptions (incorrect PEP regimen N = 1, incorrect treatment duration N = 2) and with none of the 22 PEP treatment packs. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0320690.t002 The results of the three models of multivariable logistic regression are shown in Tables 3‚Äì5. After controlling for demographics (model 1: age, gender, and race/ethnicity) (Table 3), assault characteristics (model 2: assailant known status, HIV risk, and time of ED discharge) (Table 4), and APP experience (model 3: high, moderate, low volume examiner) (Table 5), the independent effect of the SA PEP initiative on PEP prescribing remained significant (model 1: OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.6 to 8.0; model 2: OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.6 to 11.1; model 3: OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.7 to 7.5). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0320690.t003 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0320690.t004 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0320690.t005 EDs play an essential role in the evaluation and care of patients after sexual assault, including providing HIV PEP when assault-related factors are felt to put the patient at increased risk for HIV exposure and transmission [19]. Receiving PEP in a timely manner and accessing a full treatment course are critical for PEP to be effective in preventing HIV transmission after sexual assault and policies to minimize barriers to receiving a full 28-day course of PEP treatment should be prioritized [5‚Äì7,12]. This study evaluates the SA PEP program, a quality improvement initiative designed to increase the receipt of HIV PEP for ED patients after sexual assault through two strategies: 1) a modification to the sexual assault EHR template reminding providers to consider and offer PEP and 2) making available free, 28-day HIV PEP treatment packs. Combined, these strategies increased the receipt of HIV PEP three-fold, from 9.4% to 28.0%, for ED patients after sexual assault. Although the increase in PEP prescriptions during the post-intervention period cannot be attributed with 100% certainty to the SA PEP initiative alone, the differences remained statistically significant across our three logistic regression models which controlled for patient demographics, characteristics specific to the assault, and the experience of the sexual assault examiners. Although unmeasured variables may have influenced the provision of PEP in our study, we are not aware of significant changes in APP staffing, APP training, or ED census that occurred between the pre-intervention and post-intervention periods. Despite minimizing barriers to accessing PEP treatment with the SA PEP initiative, the proportion of patients receiving HIV PEP after sexual assault was relatively low (28%), especially when compared to other published reports of ED HIV PEP after sexual assault [15,16,19,25,26]. A large academic ED in the Northeastern US participating in a sexual assault nurse examiner program reported 124 (69%) of 179 patients receiving sexual assault examinations received HIV PEP over a 3-year period [15]. And a study conducted at the Boston Medical Center ED reported that 82 (45%) of 181 patients evaluated after sexual assault received HIV PEP in the form of a 3-day starter pack [16]. Another study in a large Midwestern ED reported that over a 13-year period, 87% of 423 patients evaluated after a sexual assault where a high-risk HIV exposure was identified received a full course of HIV PEP prior to discharge [19]. The magnitude of differences in HIV PEP treatment rates between these studies and ours may be explained, in part, by specific study exclusion criteria. In our analysis, we included patients regardless of the risk for HIV transmission (post-intervention period excluded only 15 of 133 encounters) whereas in the study by Cherabie et al, over 50% of their initial study population of 908 patients with a visit for sexual assault/abuse were excluded, including patients for whom PEP was not offered [19]. We believe the main driver of our low overall PEP numbers may be due to a low acceptance rather than a lack of offering. During the post-intervention period, EHR documentation revealed that the majority of patients (77%) were offered HIV PEP but only 28% accepted PEP, lower than other ED studies which report higher proportions of HIV PEP acceptance after sexual assault, ranging from 32% to 87% [15,16,19,25,26]. The retrospective nature of the study and available data, however, do not allow for an accurate understanding of why PEP acceptance was so low. A better understanding of the true offer and acceptance rate and reasons behind a patient‚Äôs decision to accept or decline PEP requires prospective evaluation. Importantly, we have seen an upward trend in PEP provision and the use of treatment packs with ongoing implementation of our SA PEP initiative, suggesting that the sustainability of this initiative is robust. An analysis of more recent 3 months (February 2024 to April 2024) demonstrate that PEP was provided to 50% of patients completing sexual assault examinations (26/51), with the majority (85%) being treatment packs. Sharing the outcomes from this initiative and eliciting feedback from the APPs at our site will hopefully identify foci for improvement and inform future trainings, educational sessions, and protocols designed to streamline eligibility assessments and increase the acceptance rate of PEP. We believe that providing HIV PEP medications-in-hand for ED patients after a sexual assault examination is the best strategy to ensure timely and appropriate treatment. Same day treatment for ED patients has been shown to improve compliance and decrease return visits and hospitalizations, especially for those who are underinsured or who are discharged at times when pharmacies are closed [27,28]. Prior studies have demonstrated that providing PEP medications-in-hand for ED patients is feasible and increases the receipt of PEP compared to providing standard prescriptions [29,30]. Compliance with PEP, although not assessed in our study, is further improved when single dose versus multiple dose regimens are used [31,32]. Additionally, we recommend supplying the full 28-day treatment at the time of discharge rather than a short bridging course to an outpatient prescription. Full treatment packs are associated with higher acceptance and completion rates than other PEP treatment strategies and assure that the correct medication regimen and duration are provided [33]. Incorrect PEP prescriptions by emergency physicians are not uncommon [34]. In our study, prescribing errors occurred in 3 (13.6%) of the 22 PEP prescriptions written by physicians and in none of the PEP treatment packs. How EDs should best go about providing HIV PEP medications to patients after sexual assault, however, is complicated, and policies guiding implementation will need to be developed at the institutional level, with input from multiple departments, balancing cost, pharmacy considerations, compliance, and safety. Providing medications-in-hand, pre-discharge is not standard ED practice. Routinely providing either starter packs or the entire 28-day course requires that EDs stock PEP drugs or have an established agreement with a pharmacy to stock, package, and rapidly dispense PEP drugs. At our institution, we leveraged an existing hospital Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee exemption which allowed the use of industry-provided Biktarvy¬Æ starter packs for use in the ED, expanding the indications to include HIV PEP. The use of industry-provided starter packs, donated free-of-charge, is often prohibited due to institutional policies and regulatory barriers, which may limit replication of our model. The use of ED or hospital-based pharmacies, however, can be used to ensure timely access to HIV PEP therapy for ED patients [30,35]. EDs with discharge pharmacies have been shown to reduce barriers like cost, transportation, and pharmacy access when compared to prescriptions requiring filling at local, outpatient pharmacies [35]. Further, many EDs have access to 24-hour inpatient pharmacies and protocols have been developed whereby these pharmacies store, package, and urgently dispense HIV PEP medications to patients prior to discharge [30]. An additional benefit of utilizing existing pharmacy infrastructure is that patients without insurance or with high copayments can be identified immediately and be enrolled in a patient-assistance program or a no-charge compassionate care provision can be applied [7,36]. This was a retrospective evaluation of a single center and the magnitude of influence of our intervention may not be generalizable to other EDs, particularly those with different patient populations, standardized PEP guidelines for sexual assault patients, and improved access to PEP medication dispensing, such as an in-house, 24-hour, 7-days-per-week pharmacy. The pre-post study design also makes it impossible to attribute the increased provision of PEP solely to the intervention (PEP treatment packs and updated sexual assault template), as other unmeasured factors, such as patient characteristics, examiner practice patterns, or other external events, may influence the primary outcome [37]. Additionally, the relative contribution of the EHR template modification versus the availability of PEP treatment packs with regards to driving the primary outcome measure of PEP prescribing is not known, as these were considered a bundled intervention. Both interventions likely influenced PEP prescribing. Missing data was not uncommon for several of the clinical variables abstracted from chart review (estimation of risk of HIV acquisition missing 32.8% and knowledge of assailant missing 18.5% of the time) and which were included in logistic regression, possibly reducing the model‚Äôs ability to accurately predict dependent variables. Patient centered outcomes, such as adherence with PEP, follow-up for repeat HIV testing and surveillance for HIV seroconversion, and opportunities to transition patients with ongoing risk for acquiring HIV infection to pre-exposure prophylaxis, were not assessed. Multiple studies have shown that both adherence with HIV PEP and outpatient follow up after ED initiation are extremely low [15,18,19,38,39]. Prospective studies evaluating barriers to adherence and follow-up are needed. EDs play an important role in the evaluation and care for patients after sexual assault. A clinical intervention consisting of an EHR template modification plus HIV PEP treatment packs led to a significant increase in the provision of PEP for ED patients evaluated after sexual assault and eliminated errors in treatment. Future research should evaluate medication receipt, adherence, and cost effectiveness of PEP treatment packs compared to prescriptions.

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob Forbes Staff andForbes Daily Forbes Staff. Last year was a banner year for companies in the S&P 500. But for small businesses, the picture is more complicated. For the first time in three years, more small businesses reported a drop in revenue in 2024 than an increase, a new Fed survey shows. Meanwhile, around 75% of firms in the S&P reported year-over-year revenue growth for fiscal year 2024, according to data from FactSet. Still, the picture isn‚Äôt entirely gloomy. Fewer small businesses said costs were going up, meaning customers may not be spending less‚Äîthe companies just may not be pushing through as many price increases that inflate revenue. ILLUSTRATION BY EMILY SCHERER FOR FORBES; PHOTO BY NATHAN DUMLAO/UNSPLASH After Donald Trump won the election in November, conditions seemed ripe for a boom in mergers and acquisitions after several years of declines. But that hasn‚Äôt happened yet, primarily due to Trump‚Äôs tariffs and other moves that have sparked fears of a slowdown. The Trump Administration‚Äôs policies‚Äîfrom tariffs to the high-profile detentions of foreigners with legal tourist visas and green cards‚Äîare having a negative impact on tourism to the U.S., a growing body of data shows. Tourism Economics, a nonpartisan Oxford Economics company, is forecasting total U.S. travel spending will be 3.7% lower than its original prediction from December, amounting to an estimated $64 billion loss this year for the U.S. economy. The New York Stock Exchange‚Äôs parent company signed a memorandum of understanding with Circle, issuer of the world‚Äôs second-largest stablecoin, to explore integrating Circle‚Äôs products into its trading and clearing empire. Stablecoins are having a moment amid a legislative push from the Trump Administration, which sees the tokens as a key way to maintain the U.S. dollar‚Äôs global dominance. Gather Health cofounder and CEO Brent Asplin with patient Karen Sterling. After watching patients come to the emergency room for chronic diseases, Dr. Brent Asplin launched a primary care startup, Gather Health, to focus specifically on higher risk older people. The firm has signed up more than 2,500 patients, all of whom are 65 or older and on Medicare. And with $17 million in new funding, he projects revenue will explode by 25 times to reach $44 million this year. AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster and Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images The Federal Election Commission, an independent agency charged with enforcing campaign finance laws, is issuing rulings and functioning with just four remaining members after President Donald Trump‚Äôs unprecedented firing of longtime Democratic member Ellen Weintraub. Following Weintraub‚Äôs ouster, which Democrats say is illegal, the agency now requires unanimous agreement to take any significant action, which is difficult considering it is often split along party lines. As Republicans seek to protect their tight majority in the House, President Donald Trump withdrew his nomination of Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) for United Nations Ambassador. Republicans hold just five more seats than Democrats in the House, after two GOP members resigned‚Äîcontroversial former Rep. Matt Gaetz, who took himself out of the running for Attorney General, and former Rep. Michael Waltz, who resigned to become Trump‚Äôs national security advisor. Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed a United Nations-led temporary administration to govern Ukraine, said he believes President Donald Trump was sincere about ending the Ukraine war and suggested that Trump‚Äôs bid to annex Greenland was ‚Äúrooted in history.‚Äù Putin, whose administration has repeatedly questioned the legitimacy of the Volodymyr Zelenskyy-led Ukrainian government, implied that such a temporary administration would be necessary for ending the war in Ukraine, though Zelenskyy and his administration have yet to respond. Shalom Meckenzie of Amp Shalom Meckenzie made a $1.4 billion fortune after merging his software company SBTech with DraftKings and going public via a SPAC. With his latest venture Amp Fitness, he‚Äôs hoping there‚Äôs a big business in at-home workouts. Amp‚Äôs business model is nearly identical to that of a slew of failed and struggling exercise companies like Tonal, Peloton and Mirror: Sell wealthy folks an expensive machine, hire a bunch of celebrity trainers, collect ‚Äúdata‚Äù and then pray you can make money by expanding into more profitable ancillary markets like personalized nutrition, subscriptions and apparel before the customers get bored and move on. It hasn‚Äôt worked for anyone else, but that‚Äôs not stopping Meckenzie, who is largely self-financing the company for now. A minimalist version of a cable crossover machine found at any gym, the wall-mounted Amp costs $2,000, and accessing the trainers (both AI and human) through the app requires a $23 monthly subscription. Amp, which launched sales in January, has hired a dozen or so fitness influencers and minor celebrities as trainers, the most famous of whom is America‚Äôs Got Talent host Terry Crews. Still, the connected at-home fitness device market is ultracompetitive and highly saturated. It boomed during the pandemic but is now littered with the shells of companies vastly better financed and much earlier to market than Amp. But Meckenzie has dealt with doubters before. ‚ÄúWhen I started SBTech, many people came to me and said, ‚ÄòShalom, you‚Äôre stupid, you‚Äôre using all the money you have and [money] you don‚Äôt have, and you‚Äôre going to get you and your family in trouble,‚Äô ‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWhen people offend me, that‚Äôs what keeps me going.‚Äù WHY IT MATTERS ‚ÄúThe at-home fitness market is rife with challenges, fads and fickle customers,‚Äù says Forbes staff writer Will Yakowicz. ‚ÄúAfter the pandemic-induced valuation boom went bust, companies like Peloton and Tonal fell back down to Earth, while products like Mirror were discontinued. Shalom Meckenzie believes his company Amp can avoid making similar mistakes incumbent companies made and says he has made a superior device infused with AI and other tech. At half the price of Tonal, it‚Äôs now up to the customers to decide.‚Äù MORE How A Swedish Fitness Toy Went Viral Thanks To Tom Brady, RFK Jr. And An Army Of Celebrities The latest target of the Trump Administration‚Äôs cost-cutting efforts is Health and Human Services, as agency head Robert F.

There‚Äôs an old saying about advertising: ‚ÄúHalf the money spent on advertising is working; we just don‚Äôt know which half.‚Äù The same could be said about the comments you hear regarding the state of advertising. Or maybe it‚Äôs our expectations more than our perceptions that don‚Äôt match reality. Conversation about monetization is so nuanced that after a decade of writing on this topic, I am still looking for meaning where there may be little to find. Essentially, what I‚Äôve come to understand is that ad¬≠vertising is like the stock market: Certain aspects of advertising deals are not transparent now and may never become fully transparent. What is clear, ac¬≠cording to research from Statista, is that 64% of rev¬≠enue growth in the U.S. in OTT is coming from ad¬≠vertising. More details on that in a moment. The expectation that buying advertising should be the same in streaming as it is in linear TV is unrealis¬≠tic. ‚ÄúWhen buyers traditionally bought TV, they were able to see exactly where their campaigns were run¬≠ning‚Äîshow and time‚Äîand theoretically, they knew exactly how many people watched,‚Äù says Tameka Kee, SVP of programming and operations at the Coalition for Innovative Media Measurement (CIMM). ‚ÄúWhen it comes to streaming, none of that is true. Buyers do deserve to know where and how their campaigns run, but I think that they‚Äôre holding streaming to a higher standard than they held TV to.‚Äù Regardless of what ad buyers expect, the more phil¬≠osophical question is, ‚ÄúWhy should TV and streaming be the same?‚Äù ‚ÄúIn the past 12‚Äì18 months, as an indus¬≠try, we‚Äôve been far more open to things we were never open to before,‚Äù says Karen Babcock, VP of advertis¬≠ing strategy and partnerships at Comcast. ‚ÄúLooking back 10 years, advertisers, for all intents and pur¬≠poses, bought [gross rating points], and they bought spots. And when they did that, they were buying it based off of the content it was running in.‚Äù They were really buying audiences, she contends, but preferred to think of them as content. ‚ÄúWith the growth of streaming,‚Äù Babcock explains, ‚Äúthis whole idea of ‚ÄòWhat content am I landing in‚Äô and ‚ÄòI bought this show for this reason‚Äô is almost trans¬≠formed into, ‚ÄòI need to reach Nadine somewhere where is she watching,‚Äô and ‚ÄòHow can I find a way to reach her at the right amount of times?‚Äô‚Äù For better or worse, there‚Äôs a lot more information floating out there today about me and every other consumer, so answers to those questions are more readily available now than they were a decade ago. Everyone, of course, speaks about targeting viewers in a privacy-compliant way, although the accuracy of that phrase seems open to debate. As a refresher, advertising, in the best circumstanc¬≠es, is bought based on content channel, ratings, genre, and audience. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs trying to make sure you‚Äôre sending the right identifiers, so the advertiser can choose how they want to match their audience,‚Äù says Reed Barker, head of advertising at Philo. These identifiers can in¬≠clude Unified ID 2.0 (UID2), Google‚Äôs PAIR, Yahoo Con¬≠nectID, Epsilon‚Äôs COREid, LiveRamp‚Äôs RampId, etc. The advertiser is bidding on a block of known data, which in the U.S. includes identifiers created by var¬≠ious groups. The Trade Desk describes its UID2 as ‚Äúan identity fabric for the open internet.‚Äù In this and other identifiers, data is hashed so it remains spe¬≠cific about a consumer‚Äôs interests, but not specific to a person, with direct identifiers removed. However, anonymous details like age, income, and education remain, plus other data that enhances advertisers‚Äô ability to target viewers. Then, device ID and IP ad¬≠dress are thrown into a Venn diagram-like graph, with the resulting intersection of a cohort who likes a certain thing, lives in a particular place, makes a certain amount of money, and has specific beliefs. For a subscription service, this will also be matched to subscriber‚Äôs information if they‚Äôre authenticated. The nature of modern streaming is that the ser¬≠vices were started by many different companies, and ad buyers need to work within this realm. Psycholo¬≠gists say the dynamic of doing the same thing (in this case, buying advertising in streaming) and expecting a different result is not going to get you very far. You really need to change, whether you want to or not. The question is, ‚ÄúWill this advertising market actu¬≠ally adapt to the new normal of streaming?‚Äù Expecting digital to be bought the same way as linear is not re¬≠alistic, no matter how much people want it to be. How¬≠ever, the business of advertising seems to be ticking along fairly well if you look at overall stats. Statista reports on the revenue of what it classifies as OTT. This includes digital media distribution by SVOD, digital purchases via download or permanent cloud storage (electronic sell-through, or EST), OTT video advertising, and FAST services, such as Pluto TV or Tubi. In the U.S., Statista notes, revenue is expected to reach $146.30 billion in 2025. The largest revenue share in OTT belongs to video advertising, with an ex¬≠pected 2025 U.S. revenue of $93.88 billion. U.S. annual growth rate is pegged at 7.25%, and OTT has captured 71.7% of U.S. consumers. However, YouTube has 16% of this market. The average revenue per user (ARPU) Statista reports for OTT is $593.30. I think it‚Äôs safe to say we‚Äôre in the late stage of consumer adoption. Other regions‚Äô general adoption is as follows: Statista also predicts a compound annual growth rate of 5.8% for Latin America for 2025‚Äì2029, result¬≠ing in a projected market volume of $14.56 billion. There has been a business model ping-pong match of subscriptions, ad-supported content (later to in¬≠clude FAST), subscriptions with ads, transactional content, and even outright content purchases. In 2024‚Äì2025, advertising came out on top. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre depending on a single revenue model, then you‚Äôre sort of stuck at the whims of the mar¬≠ketplace,‚Äù says Philo‚Äôs Barker. ‚ÄúYou want to have at least a baseline of guaranteed dollars, which comes from subscriptions. I‚Äôd like to have the same margin on the subscription, and if I‚Äôm not going to get it, if it has ads, then I‚Äôm going to have extra margin from ads so I can charge less for the subscription. Where is the profit coming from?‚Äù One wonders if that means the ad-supported mod¬≠el has a larger potential for growth. ‚ÄúIt does, but you can only show so many ads to people based on how engaged they are with your platform,‚Äù Barker says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs still a finite number of hours that people watch TV and a finite number of ads you can show in an ad-supported environment. I‚Äôve seen multiple people talk about how inventory has grown about 20%, and demand is growing around 13%. I think that‚Äôs across the industry, and everybody is seeing it.‚Äù One reason for this trend could be fragmentation. Another could simply be how easy it is to buy adver¬≠tising elsewhere. ‚ÄúSearch and social have done a tremendous job mak¬≠ing the buy flow for an advertiser so simple, anybody could log on,‚Äù says Comcast‚Äôs Babcock. ‚ÄúDigital premi¬≠um video has been 10 times harder to buy than it ever should have been. It‚Äôs so different and so much more complex than so many other businesses because it‚Äôs 20,000 line items every single month that want $1,000 targeted to three ZIP codes in the U.S. over these 7 days. Trying to do forecasting and optimizations is complex because of just sheer volume.‚Äù Babcock says that one of the biggest challenges or¬≠ganizations like Comcast face in 2025 is, ‚ÄúIf an ad¬≠vertiser has a million dollars to spend today, how do they get it into the system and running tomorrow? Be¬≠cause right now, that level of automation is not there. Do they have video creative that is transcoded to the right specs? Is it approved? What publishers can it run on? What pace do they need? Those are the things that we‚Äôre working on automating this year,‚Äù she says. One way Comcast is addressing this issue is through partnerships like the ad tech platform deal the company‚Äôs FreeWheel expanded with Roku in De¬≠cember 2024. ‚ÄúThat wouldn‚Äôt have existed 5 years ago because everybody looked at each other as competi¬≠tion,‚Äù Babcock says. ‚ÄúNow we‚Äôre realizing the compe¬≠tition isn‚Äôt so much ourselves‚Äîit‚Äôs search and social that have made the buying so easy.‚Äù In addition to the ease of buying on search and so¬≠cial, finding the target audience has become much harder, since consumers have a bounty of choice. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs such a fragmented landscape,‚Äù says Sarah Monahan, co-head of enterprise ad sales at Roku. ‚ÄúSports is just one example where it used to be a very straightfor¬≠ward path to find my NBA game, and now there are so many passive entries and also so many different platforms, apps, OSs, and ways to access my content. I‚Äôm unclear what my consumer is doing. We spent a lot of time educating our advertising community on this household shift [where viewers] cut the cord. Be¬≠lieve it or not, 88% of their time was spent watching completely free ad-supported content.‚Äù Another trend that continued to ramp up in 2024 was programmatic buying, in which automated buy¬≠ing, based on data, budgets, and opportunity, can be handled much more efficiently for many advertising buys. Nearly all large and many smaller companies have a self-serve programmatic offering. Disney an¬≠nounced in 2024 that 50% of its inventory is bought this way, and the company is targeting it to reach 75% by 2027. NBCUniversal had programmatic sales available for the 2024 Paris Olympics. In addition, the company claims to use generative AI to analyze content across its portfolio, paired with its first-party datasets, to pro¬≠duce emotion-based, AI-powered audience segments. As previously mentioned, in December 2024, Roku announced that it expanded its programmatic part¬≠nership with FreeWheel to make Roku content, in¬≠cluding The Roku Channel, available to FreeWheel partners via the Roku Exchange. This will enable real-time bidding among programmatic platforms, with the intent to offer advertisers more of the audiences they are looking for. Location, location, location. CTV operating system companies that are lucky enough to have a home screen environment to sell are continuing to opti¬≠mize their real estate. Home screen ads ‚Äúare the bulk of our inventory,‚Äù says Chris Hock, Whale TV‚Äôs VP of monetization. ‚ÄúWhen you turn on the TV and you get to the home screen, there‚Äôs a big, beautiful masthead that takes over the upper portion of the screen, with some kind of navigation overlay under it. That‚Äôs a great placement opportunity.‚Äù Home screen display ads in LG webOS While this inventory has been around for a while, the type of companies buying it has changed. ‚ÄúThe home screen is an entry point that 120 million peo¬≠ple a day see in the U.S.,‚Äù says Roku‚Äôs Monahan. ‚ÄúFor the first time in 2024, we started to allow advertisers to integrate into our home screen in a way that we had not before. It had been historically really limit¬≠ed to M&E. In Q4, a lot of our streamers saw really interesting brand experiences funded by Macy‚Äôs for Cyber Monday.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôve been doing for a long time for interac¬≠tive program guides,‚Äù says Craig Chinn, TiVo‚Äôs SVP of advertising sales for the Americas, is to ‚Äúhave banners within linear channels. As people are looking through their channels, they can actually click on those inter¬≠active program guide banners and find things that they‚Äôre going to do on our homepage hero ad.‚Äù The one thing all of these companies have in com¬≠mon is that this inventory is exclusive and a direct buy. ‚ÄúIAB Tech Lab has started to do some work around CTV formats where this masthead ad will stick out and get some specifications around it so it‚Äôs easier to buy across different connected TV OSs,‚Äù says Hock. These companies and others hold the major proper¬≠ties on the OTT Monopoly board, but let‚Äôs turn our at¬≠tention to a few disrupters. These may seem like fringe use cases, but they are an important step in moving the conversation away from ‚ÄúWe need change‚Äù to ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs what change looks like.‚Äù A number of companies spoke to me about contex¬≠tual advertising, including Gracenote and Bitmovin. (See more on Bitmovin in The State of Generative AI 2025.) ‚ÄúA lot of the techniques that people have used in browsers to do audience-based advertising are not as effective in CTV,‚Äù says Trent Wheeler, Gracenote‚Äôs chief product officer. ‚ÄúContextual can serve both as a way to help to identify the type of content and also to allow more interesting use cases and brand con¬≠nection.‚Äù Gracenote launched contextual last year along with Magnite. Customers include Cineverse, DIRECTV Advertising, Philo, Tastemade, and Xumo. ‚ÄúGracenote Contextual builds on the company‚Äôs metadata used for recommendation, but helps pub¬≠lishers position their content to the demand side, to the advertiser market overall,‚Äù says Wheeler. ‚ÄúThe most straightforward example is live sports con¬≠tent. It is actually very hard to tell in a live sporting event how important or exciting a particular event is. For advertisers, it‚Äôs a complex data flow. We will very clearly mark the content, ‚ÄòHere‚Äôs live sports.‚Äô We can even do things like tell you the score of the game or tell you how close it is. So, if you want to advertise in particularly exciting segments or close segments, those are datasets we could provide.‚Äù With the extent of fragmentation in CTV, Wheeler continues, ‚ÄúAudience information is harder to get. There are a lot of different, smaller pockets of in¬≠ventory across CTV. The market is huge. I‚Äôve seen estimates between 30 and 40 billion in regard to CTV advertising, and obviously the promise is, ‚ÄòTake what you like about TV advertising and the digital eco¬≠system, and combine them together.‚Äô‚Äù If you look at TV advertising revenue over the last year, it has been pretty flat. ‚ÄúThe best example I have for this is our main customer in Europe called TF1, the biggest channel in Europe,‚Äù says Mathias Guille, VP of cloud platform at Broadpeak. ‚ÄúThey earn around 1.5 billion euros [annually], and that has been pretty flat for the past 20 years. Business growth is 1%‚Äì2% every year. If you compare that to Facebook or Meta in France, every year, they have double-digit growth. How do you explain that difference? TF1 is working with 500 advertisers on TV. Facebook and Meta in France have 500,000 advertisers.‚Äù Many companies have thought this same thing and have set up self-serve platforms where SMB buyers can purchase advertising in streaming as easily as you can on social. ‚ÄúIf you can bring more advertisers every day to your platform, this is where you get more revenue. They may have smaller budgets, but they bring more growth across the platform,‚Äù says Guille. Broadpeak was looking at creating a different type of ad product. ‚ÄúIf you have a small budget, you want to pay per click (otherwise called performance marketing),‚Äù Guille says. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to pay per impression because impressions don‚Äôt bring in new conversions. TV needs to bring what we call perfor¬≠mance metrics‚Äîit needs actually to tell advertisers the number of clicks, the interest, and what you gen¬≠erate with the ad.‚Äù The key challenge, Guille notes, ‚Äúis to make ads on TV clickable. In the last year, you‚Äôve seen a lot of initia¬≠tives with people putting QR codes on ads, and that‚Äôs the first step, because if people can scan the QR code, then you can know how many times they scan the QR code. But that‚Äôs not enough.‚Äù Guille goes on to say that the QR code is too compli¬≠cated for people to use and that the target should be the click itself. ‚ÄúWith a click, especially on the remote, you don‚Äôt think about it. You send a notification to your phone; you can look at that later on,‚Äù he explains. With¬≠in the SDK used for measurement, viewers can pass the URL for a click. ‚ÄúSo, typically, when we request the ad from the ad server, we get the creative, but we also get the URL of the product. The reason that no one is using that on TV today is because there‚Äôs nowhere to put that URL. We put that URL into our SSAI.‚Äù Amazon is using a similar approach, but instead of targeting SMBs, it targets its own retail platform. When you watch Amazon Prime, there are clickable ads. Instead of sending you a push notification, click¬≠ing on that ad means you can put the advertised prod¬≠uct directly into your Amazon cart. Amazon Prime‚Äôs clickable/shoppable ads Edge226 is the developer of Peak, an AI-powered ad tech platform. Boaz Cohen, Edge226‚Äôs chief revenue officer, describes the company‚Äôs strategy as ‚Äúbring¬≠ing new advertisers to the TV space. Traditionally, he says, the TV space is all about ‚Äúbrands. In the past 2, 3 years, apps and games have started advertising in the streaming services.‚Äù All of a sudden, advertising has another new revenue source. ‚ÄúWe are bringing new adver¬≠tisers‚Äîapps and games‚Äîto the space,‚Äù Cohen notes. ‚ÄúThat happened because the mea¬≠surement companies in our in¬≠dustry‚ÄîAdjust, AppsFlyer, Sin¬≠gular, and Branch‚Äîadded the ability to measure the impact of app downloads on CTV. Once that had happened, advertis¬≠ers who are very much perfor¬≠mance-driven started adding CTV or streaming to their ad¬≠vertising mix.‚Äù They either pro¬≠vide a link on mobile or have a call to action to search the app store to download their cus¬≠tomer‚Äôs app. ‚ÄúWe are definite¬≠ly not buying the $40 Disney or Netflix‚Äù ad, Cohen says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking at the $6‚Äì$10 CPM, sometimes higher, pri¬≠marily running on FAST channels.‚Äù New ad formats have also been creeping onto the screen for a while now, e.g., the L-Wrap, which takes two sides of the screen. There is also a two-box shrink¬≠able ad, where the content will continue to play in one screen, and then the ad will be next to it. ‚ÄúI think those are starting to get a lot of buzz and excitement,‚Äù says one publisher. L-Wrap advertising in live sports streams ‚ÄúThose do pretty well for sporting events, where they still keep viewers engaged to the screen. Viewers can see some activity in a timeout for example, but also see the ad. They‚Äôre probably less effective for binge-watching or episodic entertainment programming,‚Äù says Whale TV‚Äôs Hock. Two gotchas now: How do you sell these, and how do you measure them? ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs usually not even an ad for¬≠mat on a lot of these interfaces, so you obviously can‚Äôt scale if there‚Äôs no nice, automated way to do this,‚Äù Hock contends. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still early to see if these formats catch on.‚Äù Whale TV is currently offering these new formats to the 300‚Äì400 TV manufacturers that use its OS. Two-box shrinkable ads ‚ÄúI‚Äôm most excited to lean into optimization, which is in the middle of a flight with a 3-week campaign that‚Äôs running,‚Äù says Comcast‚Äôs Babcock. ‚ÄúThe adver¬≠tiser should get an email that says, ‚ÄòThese appear to be the three most important performance segments that we‚Äôre running against. Do you want to double down?‚Äô‚Äù That option should be available through the click of a button, she notes. ‚ÄúRight now, it‚Äôs somebody calling and doing a lot of work.‚Äù This seems like an ad tech problem. But realistical¬≠ly, it‚Äôs also how business has been done since time im¬≠memorial, so addressing this particular issue seems like a big ask. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve all seen pressure from Amazon coming into the marketplace with Prime Video,‚Äù says Philo‚Äôs Bark¬≠er. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôve seen multiple reports talking about how even the big guys like Netflix, Max, and Amazon Prime have dropped their CPMs. I think what is inter¬≠esting about where CPMs are going from a publisher perspective is that there are a lot of people who take a tax along the way. Someone may be buying an ad for a high CPM‚Äîlet‚Äôs say $50‚Äîand by the time it gets to us, we may see only half of that because the agency took a cut, the DSP took a cut, the SSP took a cut, the targeting methodology took a cut. By the time we get it, we‚Äôre seeing less.‚Äù One way Philo is working on this is by hav¬≠ing varying pricing levels available within a programmatic buy. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve just started a programmatic direct deal,‚Äù Barker says. ‚ÄúBut we probably have 2,000 private market¬≠place deals through our vendors running it at any one time. A lot of them will be priced differently depending on things like trans¬≠parency. We have multiple tiers that we‚Äôre all constantly adjusting for different types of advertisers.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs just a finite amount of growth that can come from subscriptions,‚Äù states CIMM‚Äôs Kee. ‚ÄúOn the one hand, we‚Äôll see ad-supported services continue to roll out because people want free stuff.‚Äù Regarding a lot of these new formats or approaches, she says, they need to be standardized and scalable. ‚ÄúIf a media agency can‚Äôt put this in a media plan as a line item and run it through Mediaocean in the same way that they can run something else, then it‚Äôs not going to scale.‚Äù ‚Äú2024 was the first time we saw over 50% of 18-to-49-year-olds primarily view their sports‚Äîregard¬≠less of the league‚Äîon streaming versus linear,‚Äù says Roku‚Äôs Monahan. Adding live sports to streaming in the past few years has made the transition to stream¬≠ing complete. ‚ÄúI think the dirty secret in buying is everybody‚Äôs of¬≠fering all these amazing ways to target, whether it‚Äôs contextual or all these IDs. You can send sentiment, all these things that they‚Äôre selling,‚Äù says Philo‚Äôs Reed. ‚ÄúBut while it looks great, if you use the Baskin-Robbins analogy, the top sellers are still going to be chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry, because people are used to that, and that‚Äôs how they do it.‚Äù Will advertising face major disruption anytime soon? I have my doubts. This is a long game. I want to cheer each and every small step that disrupts the sta¬≠tus quo, and maybe one day, we will see a new flavor that everyone loves. But remember: It‚Äôs not enough to want to change. Can generative AI (gen AI) rip things apart and then try to glue it all back together with more insight, more intelligence, more efficiency, and more value? It really depends on what the application is. Within the video workflow, some tasks are good matches for using gen AI, and others aren't. What does the future of streaming monetization look like? This post-Peak TV media ecosystem is a brave new world, and being able to find the content you want, with the price you want to pay, will likely keep consumers on their toes for years to come. Streaming media business and monetization models expanded and diversified in 2022 and sent a clear message: Paid subscription models were a necessary gateway to widespread streaming adoption, but now ad-supported viewing has a chance to flourish.

Title: CoreWeave prices IPO lower than expected, and its stock still sags on its debut before recovering

UPDATED 21:34 EDT / MARCH 27 2025 by Mike Wheatley Updated Friday with market reaction: Shares of CoreWeave Inc. fell more than 5% in their stock market debut Friday morning despite the company downsizing its offer and stock price late Thursday, but by the close it had recouped losses to close 2.5% over the initial trade of $39 a share. Investors had been closely watching CoreWeave Inc.‚Äôs initial public offering after it priced its shares at just $40, much lower than was originally anticipated. The cloud computing infrastructure company, which trades under the ticker symbol ‚ÄúCRWV,‚Äù raised $1.5 billion in the sale Thursday evening, making it the biggest U.S. tech issue since 2021. Its offering was seen as a bellwether for investors‚Äô appetite for IPOs, which have been in a deep freeze for years now. CNBC reported that CoreWeave, which provides access to cloud-based graphics processing units for artificial intelligence workloads, had first targeted a price of between $47 and $55 per share. That would have valued it at around $26.5 billion based on the number of Class A and Class B shares outstanding and raised about $1 billion more. However, the offering has been reduced from 49 million shares to just 37.5 million, according to one anonymous source quoted by Bloomberg, which was the first to report the $40 price. It means CoreWeave‚Äôs valuation will be closer to $19 billion, though its market capitalization will remain higher on a fully diluted basis. According to CNBC, CoreWeave has still managed to attract some prestigious backers at that price, with Nvidia Corp. set to buy up $250 million worth of shares at the $40 price. The company had been hoping to capitalize on the rising demand for AI computing resources and the broader trend that has seen investors throw billions of dollars at AI startups. Buoyed by its close proximity to a number of AI industry leaders, CoreWeave highlighted in its IPO prospectus how its revenue had jumped seven times in the last year. But as investors looked more closely at the company‚Äôs business model, a number of concerns emerged. The company is reliant on two major customers that account for 77% of its total revenue, and it has estimated that it will need to spend billions of dollars in capital to keep up with Nvidia‚Äôs two-year GPU refresh lifecycle. A report by London‚Äôs Financial Times earlier this week dented CoreWeave‚Äôs prospects when it said that Microsoft, which provides around two-thirds of its revenue, had gone back on some of its commitments due to issues around delivery and deadlines. CoreWeave pushed back, saying the report was ‚Äúfalse and misleading,‚Äù but it only intensified concerns some investors have that big technology companies may be overspending on AI. In the last few weeks, several analysts have noted that Microsoft appears to be scaling back on its data center investment plans. And last month, Amazon Web Services Inc., the biggest cloud infrastructure company of all, also appeared to reduce some of its near-term spending plans. Investors also noted that CoreWeave‚Äôs capital spending plans cannot be funded by its existing revenue, even after it added OpenAI as its third major customer earlier this month. It‚Äôs currently sitting on $12 billion in debt, and that‚Äôs expected to grow to about $21 billion by the end of the year. Writing in his column in The Information, the financial market analyst Cory Weinberg revealed that investors he has talked to have shared concerns regarding the proportion of CoreWeave‚Äôs revenue that‚Äôs tied to Microsoft and Nvidia. There are other alarm bells too. ‚ÄúThey worry about CoreWeave‚Äôs founders having sold so much stock already,‚Äù Weinberg wrote. ‚ÄúThey worry about how much cash the company expects to burn.‚Äù EquityZen analyst Phil Haslett told The Street there are also concerns about the broader macroeconomic uncertainties in the economy, plus questions about the strength of AI demand, putting the onus on CoreWeave to tell a more convincing story to investors. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a unique business model that needs to find the right positioning,‚Äù Haslett said. ‚ÄúHyperscalers may decide to build out their own infrastructure (like Meta Platforms), but smaller tech companies could still need a scalable solution (that CoreWeave provides).‚Äù CoreWeave‚Äôs decision to lower both its share price and the number of shares it plans to sell may be an attempt to find that positioning. But although the lower price may make its stock seem more enticing, it‚Äôs not clear if it will be low enough to convince market naysayers, and apparently there are a lot of them. In his column, Weinberg said he had read the results of a confidential survey of 135 investors from an investment bank not involved in the IPO. It revealed that 90% of respondents didn‚Äôt believe CoreWeave had a ‚Äúsustainable moat,‚Äù meaning they don‚Äôt consider it a sustainable long-term investment. ‚ÄúOne respondent summed up a broader perception about CoreWeave: ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs radioactive, and I think every investor knows that,‚Äô‚Äù Weinberg wrote. Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. told SiliconANGLE the concerns over CoreWeave‚Äôs overexposure to Microsoft are justified, but believes there‚Äôs still a great market opportunity for a dedicated AI cloud platform if it gets the execution right. ‚ÄúWithout a firm commitment from Microsoft, it remains a risk, but it might still be worth a shot for some investors,‚Äù he added. CoreWeave‚Äôs debut is being watched keenly by the wider tech industry, for the IPO is seen as a major test for the market‚Äôs readiness for a new wave of stock offerings. IPOs have been few and far between since 2022, with rising interest rates and soaring inflation dampening investor enthusiasm for risky bets. The last technology company that raised more than $1 billion through an IPO was Freshworks Inc. back in 2021, and last year, both Rubrik Inc. and Reddit Inc. raised about $750 million via their offerings. In the wake of President Donald Trump‚Äôs election victory last November, many analysts said they expect to see renewed IPO activity. But the imposition of multiple tariffs has instead shocked the global economy, creating uncertainty that could dissuade investors from betting on new offerings. A number of technology firms have filed to go public later this year, including the ticketing marketplace StubHub Inc., digital health startup Hinge Health Inc., financial platform eToro Inc. and the online lender Klarna Group Plc.

UPDATED 21:34 EDT / MARCH 27 2025 by Mike Wheatley Updated Friday with market reaction: Shares of CoreWeave Inc. fell more than 5% in their stock market debut Friday morning despite the company downsizing its offer and stock price late Thursday, but by the close it had recouped losses to close 2.5% over the initial trade of $39 a share. Investors had been closely watching CoreWeave Inc.‚Äôs initial public offering after it priced its shares at just $40, much lower than was originally anticipated. The cloud computing infrastructure company, which trades under the ticker symbol ‚ÄúCRWV,‚Äù raised $1.5 billion in the sale Thursday evening, making it the biggest U.S. tech issue since 2021. Its offering was seen as a bellwether for investors‚Äô appetite for IPOs, which have been in a deep freeze for years now. CNBC reported that CoreWeave, which provides access to cloud-based graphics processing units for artificial intelligence workloads, had first targeted a price of between $47 and $55 per share. That would have valued it at around $26.5 billion based on the number of Class A and Class B shares outstanding and raised about $1 billion more. However, the offering has been reduced from 49 million shares to just 37.5 million, according to one anonymous source quoted by Bloomberg, which was the first to report the $40 price. It means CoreWeave‚Äôs valuation will be closer to $19 billion, though its market capitalization will remain higher on a fully diluted basis. According to CNBC, CoreWeave has still managed to attract some prestigious backers at that price, with Nvidia Corp. set to buy up $250 million worth of shares at the $40 price. The company had been hoping to capitalize on the rising demand for AI computing resources and the broader trend that has seen investors throw billions of dollars at AI startups. Buoyed by its close proximity to a number of AI industry leaders, CoreWeave highlighted in its IPO prospectus how its revenue had jumped seven times in the last year. But as investors looked more closely at the company‚Äôs business model, a number of concerns emerged. The company is reliant on two major customers that account for 77% of its total revenue, and it has estimated that it will need to spend billions of dollars in capital to keep up with Nvidia‚Äôs two-year GPU refresh lifecycle. A report by London‚Äôs Financial Times earlier this week dented CoreWeave‚Äôs prospects when it said that Microsoft, which provides around two-thirds of its revenue, had gone back on some of its commitments due to issues around delivery and deadlines. CoreWeave pushed back, saying the report was ‚Äúfalse and misleading,‚Äù but it only intensified concerns some investors have that big technology companies may be overspending on AI. In the last few weeks, several analysts have noted that Microsoft appears to be scaling back on its data center investment plans. And last month, Amazon Web Services Inc., the biggest cloud infrastructure company of all, also appeared to reduce some of its near-term spending plans. Investors also noted that CoreWeave‚Äôs capital spending plans cannot be funded by its existing revenue, even after it added OpenAI as its third major customer earlier this month. It‚Äôs currently sitting on $12 billion in debt, and that‚Äôs expected to grow to about $21 billion by the end of the year. Writing in his column in The Information, the financial market analyst Cory Weinberg revealed that investors he has talked to have shared concerns regarding the proportion of CoreWeave‚Äôs revenue that‚Äôs tied to Microsoft and Nvidia. There are other alarm bells too. ‚ÄúThey worry about CoreWeave‚Äôs founders having sold so much stock already,‚Äù Weinberg wrote. ‚ÄúThey worry about how much cash the company expects to burn.‚Äù EquityZen analyst Phil Haslett told The Street there are also concerns about the broader macroeconomic uncertainties in the economy, plus questions about the strength of AI demand, putting the onus on CoreWeave to tell a more convincing story to investors. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a unique business model that needs to find the right positioning,‚Äù Haslett said. ‚ÄúHyperscalers may decide to build out their own infrastructure (like Meta Platforms), but smaller tech companies could still need a scalable solution (that CoreWeave provides).‚Äù CoreWeave‚Äôs decision to lower both its share price and the number of shares it plans to sell may be an attempt to find that positioning. But although the lower price may make its stock seem more enticing, it‚Äôs not clear if it will be low enough to convince market naysayers, and apparently there are a lot of them. In his column, Weinberg said he had read the results of a confidential survey of 135 investors from an investment bank not involved in the IPO. It revealed that 90% of respondents didn‚Äôt believe CoreWeave had a ‚Äúsustainable moat,‚Äù meaning they don‚Äôt consider it a sustainable long-term investment. ‚ÄúOne respondent summed up a broader perception about CoreWeave: ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs radioactive, and I think every investor knows that,‚Äô‚Äù Weinberg wrote. Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. told SiliconANGLE the concerns over CoreWeave‚Äôs overexposure to Microsoft are justified, but believes there‚Äôs still a great market opportunity for a dedicated AI cloud platform if it gets the execution right. ‚ÄúWithout a firm commitment from Microsoft, it remains a risk, but it might still be worth a shot for some investors,‚Äù he added. CoreWeave‚Äôs debut is being watched keenly by the wider tech industry, for the IPO is seen as a major test for the market‚Äôs readiness for a new wave of stock offerings. IPOs have been few and far between since 2022, with rising interest rates and soaring inflation dampening investor enthusiasm for risky bets. The last technology company that raised more than $1 billion through an IPO was Freshworks Inc. back in 2021, and last year, both Rubrik Inc. and Reddit Inc. raised about $750 million via their offerings. In the wake of President Donald Trump‚Äôs election victory last November, many analysts said they expect to see renewed IPO activity. But the imposition of multiple tariffs has instead shocked the global economy, creating uncertainty that could dissuade investors from betting on new offerings. A number of technology firms have filed to go public later this year, including the ticketing marketplace StubHub Inc., digital health startup Hinge Health Inc., financial platform eToro Inc. and the online lender Klarna Group Plc.

Title: CoreWeave Stock May Pop On IPO Then Fall As Growth Becomes Harder

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan Senior Contributor. PARQUE DAS NACOES, LISBON, PORTUGAL - 2024/11/13: Michael Intrator, Co-founder & CEO of CoreWeave, ... More addresses the audience during the second day of the Web Summit 2024 in Lisbon. Web Summit is an annual technology conference featuring high profile individuals. The event was founded in 2009 by Irish entrepreneur Paddy Cosgrave, alongside David Kelly, and Daire Hickey, Web Summit was originally held in Dublin, Ireland. It moved to Lisbon in 2016. (Photo by Bruno de Carvalho/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) By my count, there have been zero initial public offerings related to generative artificial intelligence. That‚Äôs compared to 2,888 IPOs during the dot-com era, according to International Banker. That could change March 28 when shares of AI cloud hosting firm CoreWeave begin trading, according to the Wall Street Journal. The offering size was cut on March 27 to $1.5 billion‚Äî‚Äúselling 37.5 million shares below the range at $40 apiece,‚Äù Reuters reported. This was below the $2.7 billion some investors initially hoped for, added Reuters. When you place yourself between a big buyer and a big seller you are at a high risk of getting squeezed by both. With Microsoft as a big customer and Nvidia as its AI chip supplier, that is where CoreWeave sits in the industry. Therefore, while CoreWeave‚Äôs investment bankers will try to engineer a big first-day pop, I think investors may be better off resisting the urge to buy the stock. That‚Äôs because CoreWeave is: In addition, questions remain about whether Michael Intrator‚Äîwho managed hedge funds before taking over CoreWeave in 2017 and lacks public company CEO experience‚Äîcan deliver expectations-beating financial results and raise guidance each quarter. While extremely rapid growth in demand for Nvidia chips could keep CoreWeave ahead of those expectations, investors seem to have concluded the AI chip designer‚Äôs triple-digit revenue growth is behind it. I have requested comment from CoreWeave and will update this post if I receive a reply. Livingston, New Jersey-based CoreWeave was started in 2017 to mine crypto and has since evolved into a provider of AI cloud computing services. CoreWeave was an early buyer of Nvidia GPUs for data centers before they became popular for running AI applications, reported Bloomberg. In 2024, the company‚Äôs 2024 revenue grew about 730% to $1.9 billion while its net loss increased 45% to $863 million, noted Bloomberg. CoreWeave has signed ‚Äútwo sizable deals ahead of its listing‚Äù‚Äîincluding a pact to deliver up to $11.9 billion in AI infrastructure to OpenAI in exchange for which the startup will receive $350 million worth of CoreWeave stock, Bloomberg wrote. The company also had $15.1 billion in ‚Äúremaining performance obligations‚Äù at the end of 2024 and has said a ‚Äúlittle over half of that will be recognized as revenue by the end of 2026,‚Äù the Journal reported. CoreWeave is in a fierce competition to buy Nvidia chips. Indeed, much wealthier companies‚ÄîMicrosoft (which accounted for 62% of CoreWeave‚Äôs 2024 revenue), Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet‚Äîare increasing capital expenditures by 39% in 2025 to more than $340 billion, the Journal wrote. Intrator will enjoy significant voting control over CoreWeave. He is expected to hold about 2% of the company‚Äôs Class A shares and ‚Äúalmost half the company‚Äôs Class B shares after the deal, giving him 37% of the shareholder voting power,‚Äù according the IPO prospectus. None of CoreWeave‚Äôs founders plan to sell stock in the IPO. Investors must consider whether CoreWeave will be able to manage major risks to its business. The most significant of these include the company‚Äôs high dependence on a few customers, a large inventory of an older generation of AI chips for rent, and high cash burn rate and rising debt. A substantial portion of CoreWeave‚Äôs revenue comes from a small number of large customers. A big risk facing the company‚Äîand hence investors‚Äîis ‚Äúthe loss of, or a significant reduction in, spend from one or a few of our top customers would‚Äù which would damage the company‚Äôs ‚Äúbusiness, operating results, financial condition, and future prospects,‚Äù noted CoreWeave‚Äôs IPO prospectus. How so? About 77% of CoreWeave‚Äôs revenue came from its top two customers in 2024, one of which was Microsoft, which accounted for nearly two-thirds of overall sales, according to the prospectus. A basic truth of the semiconductor industry is chips become obsolete rapidly. This is certainly true of the AI chip segment‚Äîin which Nvidia keeps cannibalizing its biggest selling by developing new ones that are faster and more powerful, according to my book ‚ÄúBrain Rush: How to Invest and Compete in the Real World of Generative AI.‚Äù CoreWeave‚Äîwhich rents hourly access to Nvidia graphics processing units so developers can build more advanced AI models, according to CNBC‚Äîholds a huge inventory of Nvidia‚Äôs slower chips. Most of CoreWeave‚Äôs AI chips ‚Äì some 250,000 H-100 Hopper chips, noted CNBC‚Äîwere in-demand a few years ago but not so much now. The Hopper chips were state of the art and scarce in 2023 and 2024 as AI companies scrambled to buy them when ChatGPT was rapidly gaining users in 2023, CNBC reported. Now, Nvidia‚Äôs Blackwell GPUs ‚Äì which started shipping late last year‚Äîare blowing Hopper chips out of the water. Hopper chips are ‚Äúfine‚Äù for some circumstances but "not many," Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang joked at Nvidia‚Äôs GTC conference last week, CNBC wrote. The risk to CoreWeave? As new chips come out, the value to developers and hence the rate the company can charge to rent its Hopper chips will drop. That price drop could threaten CoreWeave‚Äôs top line‚Äîespecially with Blackwell systems in full production. When Nvidia launches an upgraded version of Blackwell in late 2026, the price of Hopper chips will go down, as will the price of renting them, Huang said. CoreWeave‚Äôs rental rates have plunged and are likely to keep dropping. H100s rented at $8 per hour in 2023‚Äîwhich has since plunged more than 66% to below $2/hour, noted CNBC. To compete with Blackwell on price per output, CoreWeave would need to slash its rental rate to 65% below what customers pay for the Blackwell. More specifically, CoreWeave would need to charge 98 cents per hour to match the $2.20 per hour per GPU for a Blackwell rack system, analyst firm SemiAnalysis told CNBC. CoreWeave may keep struggling to provide developers with state-of-the-art chips at competitive prices. As it strains against too much old inventory, the company may write off the value of its older chips faster than expected‚Äîwhich would cut into earnings, noted Barclays analyst Ross Sandler in a March 21 report featured by CNBC. CoreWeave says change to its ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù assumptions about the useful lifetime of its AI infrastructure, could hurt its business or future prospects, noted the company‚Äôs prospectus. CoreWeave is not adding enough value to the chips it buys from Nvidia to charge a high enough price to generate positive cash flow. Meanwhile, the company is borrowing heavily‚Äî collateralized by Nvidia chips, noted the Journal. To satisfy its revenue growth, CoreWeave‚Äôs cash burn rate soared nearly six-fold to about $6 billion in 2024 ‚Äúbecause of the heavy capital expenditures to build out its AI infrastructure,‚Äù the Journal wrote. So, it comes as little surprise CoreWeave had trouble complying with the terms of a $7.6 billion loan from Blackstone. The good news is CoreWeave ‚Äúdid not miss any payments under the loan facility,‚Äù according to the Financial Times. The bad news is CoreWeave ‚Äúmade a slew of serious administrative errors, which stemmed from beginning to use the financing to expand into western Europe,‚Äù noted The Financial Times, which was prohibited by loan contract terms restricting the debt‚Äôs collateral to the U.S. This highlights another risk of concern to investors‚Äî‚Äúmaterial weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting,‚Äù noted the IPO prospectus. The default incident cast a ‚Äúhorrific‚Äù light on CoreWeave‚Äôs internal controls given how ‚Äúobvious‚Äù the restrictions were, a hedge fund manager told The Financial Times. Weak internal controls are particularly troubling for a company so heavily dependent on debt. By the end of 2024, CoreWeave had raised $12.9 billion of debt and had drawn about $8 billion from the facilities, according to its latest financial report. The cash outflows to meet repayment obligations are significant. The company must make ‚Äúnearly $7.5bn in debt and interest payments by the end of next year,‚Äù reported The Financial Times. Neither Blackstone nor CoreWeave commented on The Financial Times report. To profit from investing in CoreWeave, investors will need many things to go their way. The stock will likely rise only if the company can beat and raise in future quarters. Moreover, CoreWeave lacks the capital those larger rivals can deploy and will not get enough from the IPO to close the distance‚Äîespecially since the company has said $1 billion is earmarked to pay down debt, noted the Journal. The success of CoreWeave also depends on whether demand for AI continues to grow very rapidly. ‚ÄúWe believe this structure may continue to work as long as demand for AI continues to grow exponentially,‚Äù D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria wrote in a March 24 report where he set a neutral rating on CoreWeave‚Äôs shares, according to the Journal. With Nvidia stock down 10% so far this year and the company‚Äôs growth rate slowing down as I wrote in a February Forbes post, it remains unclear how CoreWeave can sustain fast enough growth to exceed the high expectations embedded in its post-IPO stock price.

Title: CoreWeave (CRWV) IPO Turns Into An Epic Disaster As NVIDIA Forced To Step In With A $250 Million Anchor Investment

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. We warned in early March that CoreWeave's IPO, one of the most anticipated public flotation events of the year, faced a growing chorus of headwinds, including moderating GPU prices, data center excess capacity risks courtesy of Microsoft's recent retrenchment in this space, and sustainability concerns around CoreWeave's revenue trajectory. Well, all of these factors are now coming to a head just as the company is about to go public. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, CoreWeave is a cloud company that specializes in handling GPU-intensive AI workloads. Over the past few years, the company has carved out for itself a winning niche: it has created a unique partnership with NVIDIA to be among the first to offer access to NVIDIA's latest-gen GPUs at scale, all packaged within an infrastructure that has been optimized to handle AI workloads, replete with "sub-microsecond" network latency and an effective GPU lifecycle management system. Basically, CoreWeave rents out NVIDIA's latest GPUs, packaged with various bells and whistles designed to attract AI startups. This brings us to the crux of the matter. Originally, CoreWeave planned to raise at least $4 billion via an IPO that would value the company at $35 billion. Scoop: CoreWeave is planning to downsize its IPO and cut the price ‚Äî I'm hearing closer to the $23B valuation it had in the private market a year ago than the ~$30B it wanted. ‚Äî Liz Hoffman (@lizrhoffman) March 27, 2025 However, in what amounted to an inauspicious start to CoreWeave's IPO day, Semafor reported earlier today that the company was now targeting a $23 billion valuation. *COREWEAVE IS SAID PLANNING TO CUT IPO SIZE TO ABOUT $1.5B Was supposed to be $3BN. Couldn't fill half the orderbook. This is very bad for revenue roundtripping schemes https://t.co/adSrC6vqjy ‚Äî zerohedge (@zerohedge) March 27, 2025 Then, reports emerged that CoreWeave could not manage to fill even half of its orderbook and that the company would now raise just $1.5 billion in its IPO instead of its targeted cash raise of $4 billion. This IPO is a total disaster: NVDA forced to step in and "anchor" the IPO with a $250MM order at $40 per CNBC Without NVDA, which already owns 5% of CRWV, IPO would bust https://t.co/GS9rPpneGb ‚Äî zerohedge (@zerohedge) March 27, 2025 Next, CNBC is now reporting that the prevailing situation has compelled NVIDIA to step in with a $250 million investment to anchor CoreWeave's IPO at $40 per share. Of course, TD Cowen's latest note is likely to have played a role in souring the sentiment around CoreWeave's IPO. As a refresher, TD Cowen analyst Michael Elias recently leveraged his channel checks to note that Microsoft's data center lease cancelations are "more pervasive" than previously thought, prompting investors to question the sustainability of the ongoing AI-related CapEx. Specifically, Elias calculated that Microsoft appears to have walked away - via lease deferrals and outright cancelations - from over 2GW of data center capacity in the US and the EU over the past six months. While Elias concedes that Microsoft's decision not to support OpenAI's training workloads might have partially prompted this retrenchment, he goes on to declare that the prevailing paradigm "points to data center oversupply relative to its current demand forecast." Of course, do note that Google and Meta have stepped forward to reclaim some of Microsoft's recently freed data center capacity. Bear in mind that Microsoft was responsible for 62 percent of CoreWeave's revenue in 2024. And, the tech giant previously intended to spend over $10 billion on CoreWeave's services by 2030. Elsewhere, concerns continue to linger around CoreWeave's revenue and cash burn trajectory. The company burned $1.1 billion in cash in 2023, and a whopping $6 billion in 2024, courtesy of its gigantic CapEx to build out AI infrastructure. As of the end of 2024, CoreWeave housed over 250,000 GPUs from NVIDIA across its 32 data centers, with the Hopper architecture constituting the vast majority of these GPUs. Due to its relentless cash needs, CoreWeave has raised $14.5 billion in financing via 12 funding rounds. It currently has a debt load of around $11 billion. Critically, most of CoreWeave's debt stock is secured against its gigantic stash of NVIDIA GPUs. However, with an hour of GPU compute trading at just $2 at the end of 2024 vs. the $8 per hour price tag earlier in the year, some remain concerned about the health of CoreWeave's GPU collateral. CoreWeave does have one thing going for it: consider the fact that its 2024 revenue increased by 737 percent year-over-year to $1.92 billion from just $229 million in revenue that it recorded in 2023. Nonetheless, the company has yet to show a profit, having reported a net loss of $863 million in 2024, and $594 million in 2023. Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Indeed, as bitcoin‚Äôs role in global investor portfolios becomes established, we think that having more than one use will bring fresh capital inflows to the asset. This is particularly true as bitcoin investment becomes more institutionalized." Bitcoin has seen huge Wall Street adoption in the last year as a fleet of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) become some of the fastest growing funds of all time and companies follow Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy in buying bitcoin as a corporate reserve asset. ‚ÄúIf it were included, the implication would be more institutional buying as bitcoin would serve multiple purposes in investor portfolios,‚Äù Kendrick said, adding the Mag7B produced consistently higher risk-adjusted returns than the original group over the past seven years.

More stock markets in recent weeks. The bitcoin price has soared over the last year, boosted first by Wall Street and then by Donald Trump‚Äôs embrace of bitcoin and crypto on the campaign trail. The bitcoin price surged to almost $110,000 per bitcoin following Trump‚Äôs election victory and has since declined along with Tesla and other sky-high tech stocks as traders de-risk in the face of Trump‚Äôs tariff threats. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true that replacing Tesla with bitcoin would improve the historic returns of the Mag 7 group,‚Äù John Haar, managing director at bitcoin-buying app Swan Bitcoin, said in emailed comments. ‚ÄúHowever, the same can be said for including bitcoin in favor of any stock in the group. Over the past 10 years, the best performer of the Mag 7 has been Nvida, which has returned approximately 70% per year. Bitcoin has returned approximately 80% over the past 10 years.‚Äù
