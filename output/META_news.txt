According to a Bloomberg report, the secondary sale lets current and former staff who had held shares for at least two years sell stock to a handful of companies, including Thrive Capital, SoftBank Group, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi’s MGX, and T. Rowe Price. The deal marks OpenAI’s second major tender offer in under a year, following a $1.5 billion SoftBank transaction last November. In January, the Japanese conglomerate was reportedly in talks to earmark up to $25 billion for OpenAI. SoftBank’s U.S.-traded shares (SFTBY) rose 1.7% to $66.04 on Thursday after news of the OpenAI share sale, reflecting investor enthusiasm for its AI-linked deals. The $500 billion figure reflects a steep rise for OpenAI from earlier in the year, when the ChatGPT developer was valued at $300 billion following a $40 billion funding round led by Softbank in March. With this latest move, the company now sits ahead of SpaceX—whose own valuation is estimated near $400 billion—putting OpenAI at the top of the private company universe. Despite scrutiny around the rollout of GPT-5, investor confidence remains undimmed. In September, OpenAI and Nvidia unveiled a strategic infrastructure partnership: OpenAI plans to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems, and Nvidia will invest up to $100 billion progressively as each gigawatt is deployed. Jensen Huang described it as part of “bringing AI infrastructure from the labs into the world.” It also coincides with the ongoing Stargate partnership between OpenAI, Softbank, and Oracle to build out America’s AI infrastructure backed by the Trump Administration. The sale also gives employees liquidity that could help the company fend off nine-figure pay packages from rivals such as Meta, which is aggressively hiring for its new Superintelligence Labs. The timing also coincides with structural moves at OpenAI. The company lifted its capped-profit limit in May, all the while facing continued legal pressure from Elon Musk. An OpenAI co-founder, Musk has sued the company on multiple occasions. Musk has accused OpenAI of abandoning its original nonprofit mission and allegedly attempting to steal xAI data and trade secrets.

OpenAI could now be the world's most valuable startup, ahead of Elon Musk's SpaceX and TikTok's parent company ByteDance, after a secondary stock sale designed to retain employees at the ChatGPT maker. Current and former OpenAI employees sold $6.6 billion in shares to a group of investors, pushing the privately held artificial intelligence company's valuation to $500 billion, according to a source with knowledge of the deal who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The investors buying the shares included Thrive Capital, Dragoneer Investment Group and T. Rowe Price, along with Japanese tech giant SoftBank and the United Arab Emirates' MGX, the source said Thursday. The valuation reflects high expectations for the future of AI technology and continues OpenAI’s remarkable trajectory from its start as a nonprofit research lab in 2015. But with the San Francisco-based company not yet turning a profit, it could also amplify concerns about an AI bubble if the generative AI products made by OpenAI and its competitors don't meet the expectations of investors pouring billions of dollars into research and development. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has sought to dismiss those concerns, most recently last week, when he toured a massive data center complex being built to run the company's AI systems in Abilene, Texas. “Between the ten years we’ve already been operating and the many decades ahead of us, there will be booms and busts,” Altman said after being asked about a bubble. “People will overinvest and lose money, and underinvest and lose a lot of revenue.” He added that “we’ll make some dumb capital allocations” and there will be short-term ups and downs but that "over the arc that we have to plan over, we are confident that this technology will drive a new wave of unprecedented economic growth,” along with scientific breakthroughs, improvements to quality of life and “new ways to express creativity.” Just this week, the company launched two different business ventures, one a partnership with Etsy and Shopify for online shopping through ChatGPT and another a social media app, Sora, for generating and sharing AI videos. OpenAI has been struggling to offer investors and staff the same perks and compensation as the publicly traded tech giants with which it competes. Facebook parent Meta Platforms, in particular, has been on a hiring spree for elite AI engineers and in June made a $14.3 billion investment in AI company Scale that recruited its CEO Alexandr Wang. OpenAI's for-profit subsidiary, valued at $500 billion, is technically controlled by the board of OpenAI’s nonprofit and both are still bound to pursue the nonprofit’s charitable purpose. OpenAI’s partnerships with major companies and its plans to change its corporate structure have drawn the scrutiny of regulators, including the attorneys general of California and Delaware, who oversee charitable organizations that operate or are incorporated in their states. The company has made big deals in recent weeks with Oracle and SoftBank, its partners on a data center venture called Stargate, and with chipmaker Nvidia, which makes the specialized AI chips those data centers need. At the same time, it has lessened its reliance on longtime backer Microsoft. In September, OpenAI announced it had reached a tentative agreement with Microsoft about the future stake of its nonprofit in its for-profit corporation but released few details. It also opened applications for nonprofits to apply for $50 million in funding from OpenAI, an effort it launched in response to the recommendations of an advisory board. The grants will go toward projects that increase public understanding of AI, support the design of AI for uses that communities want and increase economic opportunity.

So the investors really still have any expectations? LOL This article is pure hype. ChatGPT is currently losing between $13 million and $23 million per day, depending on how costs are calculated, reflecting operating losses of roughly $400 million to $700 million per month in the second half of 2025. These figures are from several financial reports and news articles published just recently. OpenAI disclosed to shareholders and international media that it lost $2.5 billion in the first half of 2025, mostly due to R&D and operational costs for running ChatGPT on a global scale. This equates to approximately $400 million per month, or about $13 million per day, with other estimates for ongoing all-in costs reaching higher daily figures based on infrastructure, energy, and training expenditures. ChatGPT's unveiling of version 5 was a serious flop, and many users reverted to older models. The new model design and infrastructure changes obviously reflect an attempt to balance costs but at the expense of 'intelligence'. Claude by Anthropic is now preferred by most serious users, and Perplexity is favored for research. ChatGPT's research now lacks the depth, scope, and accuracy of its competitors by a significant margin. OpenAI on a standalone business basis might not be that valuable, but it turns out they have a vast amount of business partnership opportunities, $synergies which are highly unique and thus in the minds of many highly knowledgeable investors, justifying the $valuation Only time will tell, but their chances seem solid, as their scale and biz model flexibility in AI is hard to $achieve Use your Facebook account to login or register with JapanToday.

Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) capitalized on Wall Street’s artificial intelligence boom Thursday, fueled by billions in chip investments from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and other technology giants. Broadcom has emerged as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the generative AI boom, carving out a strategic niche in the rapidly evolving chip market. While competitors like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) offer off-the-shelf, high-performance GPUs, Broadcom focuses on designing custom AI chips for its hyperscale customers, the tech giants that own and operate the world’s largest data centers. Also Read: Broadcom Wins $10 Billion OpenAI Order, Analyst Sees More Growth Ahead This approach allows companies like Microsoft, Meta, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to tailor silicon to their exact needs, offering a compelling, often less expensive, alternative to the pricier, general-purpose Nvidia chips. By helping these key players design their proprietary AI accelerators, Broadcom solidifies its foundational role in the sector, ensuring its technology is deeply integrated into the core infrastructure of the AI revolution. KeyBanc Capital Markets reinforced this outlook by reiterating its Overweight rating on Broadcom and raising its price forecast to $420 from $400, citing the company’s foundational position in AI and the broader semiconductor supply chain. Following recent channel checks, analyst John Vinh said that the supply chains of Nvidia and Broadcom “sound the best,” as upward revisions are coming to chip-on-a-wafer-substrate (CoWoS) supply. Broadcom’s trajectory as a core AI beneficiary is evident in its expanded targets. Its 2026 CoWoS supply goal has climbed to 190,000 units, reflecting an anticipated year-over-year increase exceeding 160%, Vinh noted. A critical factor in its AI dominance remains control over Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google TPU franchise through 2026, with volumes expected to more than double. Additionally, Broadcom has secured significant new AI ASIC orders, including 400,000-500,000 units for OpenAI and roughly 100,000 units for Apple, reinforcing its influence over AI development and production. Analyst John Vinh raised the price forecast to $420 based on $10.37 fiscal 2026 consolidated earnings per share (EPS). Price Action: AVGO stock was trading higher by 2.31% to $341.10 at last check Thursday. Read Next: Photo by Remus Rigo via Shutterstock © 2025 Benzinga.com.

Title: OpenAI valuation reaches $500 billion, topping Musk’s SpaceX
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/10/02/openai-valuation-reaches-500-billion-topping-musks-spacex/
Time Published: 2025-10-02T18:37:55Z
Full Content:
OpenAI has completed a deal to help employees sell shares in the company at a $500 billion valuation, propelling the ChatGPT owner past Elon Musk’s SpaceX to become the world’s largest startup. Current and former OpenAI employees sold about $6.6 billion of stock to investors including Thrive Capital, SoftBank Group Corp., Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi’s MGX and T. Rowe Price, a person familiar with the transaction said. That boosted the US company’s price tag well past its previous $300 billion level during a SoftBank-led financing round earlier this year. That rapid rise underscores the investment frenzy surrounding the leaders of a technology with the potential to transform industries and economies. Sam Altman’s OpenAI is one of several companies including Nvidia Corp. now leading a global push to build data centers and develop artificial intelligence services, an undertaking that’s expected to cost trillions of dollars. Though it has yet to turn a profit, the US startup is helping fuel that infrastructure boom by inking mega-sized deals with the likes of Oracle Corp. and SK Hynix Inc. Representatives for Thrive Capital and Dragoneer didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. OpenAI, SoftBank and T. Rowe Price spokespeople declined to comment. A spokesperson for MGX said the firm is “pleased to be a core partner to OpenAI and to continue building on our strong relationship as a significant investor across multiple funding rounds.” The deal vaults OpenAI past SpaceX’s $400 billion valuation. That milestone coincides with a pivotal time for Altman’s company, which is in negotiations with Microsoft Corp. to convert into a more traditional for-profit company. OpenAI was founded in 2015 as a nonprofit dedicated to advancing digital intelligence “in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole.” Planned changes will give the existing OpenAI nonprofit entity control over a new public benefit corporation. Both Altman and Musk, who were OpenAI co-founders, have spoken about the potential existential risk to humans posed by AI. Yet they’ve since fallen out: Musk has sued to try and stop the overhaul, accusing OpenAI of forsaking promises to him when he helped to create the nonprofit. He claims it abandoned its founding purpose when it accepted billions of dollars in backing from Microsoft starting in 2019, the year after he left OpenAI’s board. When it comes to the business itself, OpenAI faces an increasingly competitive market for AI talent as big tech firms jockey for the resources they need. Meta Platforms Inc., for one, has recruited researchers aggressively from OpenAI and other top labs for its new “superintelligence” team, offering pay packages in the nine-figure range. A secondary sale could help OpenAI incentivize staff to stay at the company and turn down those lavish compensation offers. Major US startups often negotiate share sales for their employees as a way to reward and retain staff, and also attract external investors. OpenAI is looking to leverage investor demand to provide employees with liquidity that reflects the company’s growth. The value of a company tied to a secondary share sale is separate from the traditional private market valuation set when a startup completes a new round of funding. The total amount of eligible units sold in the secondary fell short of the $10 billion-plus worth of stock that the company allowed for sale, the person familiar said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the information is private. That could mean current and former employees are demonstrating confidence in the long-term viability of the business, the person added. In the long run, OpenAI faces mounting competitive pressure from rivals such as Google and Anthropic, which is also raising capital at a rapid clip. In response, OpenAI has embarked on a spate of recent technology product launches. Those include a pair of open and freely available artificial intelligence models that can mimic the human process of reasoning, months after China’s DeepSeek gained global attention with its own open software. OpenAI released its most powerful GPT-5 model in August, aimed at shoring up its lead in an increasingly crowded sphere. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Elon Musk's Net Worth Just Hit A New Record—Here's How He Made $500 Billion

The world's richest man just got richer. Elon Musk became the first person with a net worth of $500 billion in October 2025, according to Forbes. Rising Tesla shares fueled this jump in Musk's fortune. The company's stock was up nearly 17% year-to-date as of Oct. 2, 2025. Musk's wealth has been in the news for a proposed new pay package that could make him a trillionaire. Tesla (TSLA) is asking its investors to approve a massive pay package for Musk which would be valued at nearly $1 trillion if he can lead the company to achieve certain valuation and operations milestones over the next 10 years, according to a recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing. Shareholders are set to vote on this pay package in November. Musk's net worth is largely driven by his stakes in Tesla and privately held rocket and satellite manufacturing company, SpaceX. The additional shares under the new pay deal could push the value of Musk-owned Tesla shares to over $2 trillion. Tesla's share price increased more than 60% in 2024, with some of those gains coming after President Trump won the election in November. An insider share sale of SpaceX in December 2024 also boosted Musk's net worth by about $50 billion, according to Bloomberg. Musk's wealth surpasses other notable billionaires including Amazon.com (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, Meta's (META) Mark Zuckerberg, and Oracle's (ORCL) Larry Ellison according to Forbes and Bloomberg. Here's how the Tesla CEO made his billions. esla is one of the largest carmakers in the world. The company builds and designs fully electric vehicles and also makes energy generation and storage products like solar panels, solar roof tiles, and battery systems. Its vehicles include sedans, mid-size SUVs and the CyberTruck. Tesla was founded in 2003 as Tesla Motors by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Musk invested in the company and was a member of the board starting in 2004. He became CEO in 2008. Musk was allowed to claim the title of cofounder after an out-of-court settlement. Tesla went public in an initial public offering (IPO) on June 29, 2010. In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from its native Palo Alto, Calif., to Austin, Texas. In July 2023, Tesla unveiled its first Cybertruck built in its Texas factory, almost two years behind the original schedule. Musk is Tesla's largest shareholder, and owns 19.7% of the company's stock as of August 29, 2025. Musk is also the cofounder and CEO of SpaceX, a rocket manufacturing company that counts NASA as a client and helps resupply the International Space Station. SpaceX became the most valuable startup in the world when it considered raising funds at a $400 billion valuation in July 2025, according to Bloomberg. Musk owns 42% of SpaceX, which has launched over 400 rockets since it was founded in 2002, and has more than 4 million subscribers for its Starlink internet service. In April 2022, Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion after threatening a hostile takeover. The deal was finalized in October 2022 after Twitter sued Musk for trying to back out of the deal. His takeover has been controversial, as he laid off much of the company’s workforce and added a paid subscription service ($8 per month) for anyone who wants their account verified. In July 2023, Musk rebranded Twitter as X, replacing the blue bird logo with the letter. Fidelity estimates that X is worth about $9.4 billion, according to Forbes, per disclosures released by the investment firm in September 2024. Fidelity's stake in X is now worth about $4.19 million, down about 79% before Musk bought X. Musk founded artificial intelligence firm xAI in 2023. In July 2025, the company was looking to raise fund from investors that would peg its valuation up to $200 billion, according to the Financial Times. The company also raised $10 billion vis loans and cash investments in June, following a $300 million share sale in July, the Financial Times reported. Musk owns about 54% of xAI, per Forbes. The team at xAI is led by Musk and others who have previously worked with OpenAI, DeepMind, Google Research, Microsoft Research, and Tesla. Musk is also the founder of The Boring Company, a construction company that aims to “solve traffic” by building tunnels. The company raised $675 million in April 2022 at a valuation of $5.7 billion, according to a release. Musk co-founded a company called Neuralink which designed a "brain-computer interface," a chip that can be implanted into the brain and would allow users to control their computers and mobile devices with their thoughts. According to the company's website, Neuralink is working to help those with quadriplegia, a symptom of paralysis that affects a person's limbs and body from the neck down, with the ability to control their devices with their thoughts. The company, which launched its first human trial in January 2024, was valued at an estimated $9 billion, after a raising $600 million earlier this year according to Semafor.

OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has reached a valuation of $500 billion, following a deal in which current and former employees sold roughly $6.6 billion worth of shares, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. This represents a bump-up from its current valuation of $300 billion, underscoring OpenAI’s rapid gains in both users and revenue. Reuters reported details of the stock sale earlier in August. As part of the deal, OpenAI employees sold shares to a consortium of investors including Thrive Capital, SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi’s MGX and T. Rowe Price, according to the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the media. The company had authorized sales of $10-billion-plus worth of stock on the secondary market, the source added. Thrive Capital, SoftBank, Dragoneer, MGX and T. Rowe Price did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. The share sale adds to SoftBank’s earlier investment in OpenAI’s $40 billion primary funding round. The company generated around $4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025, about 16% more than it generated all of last year, the Information reported earlier this week. The sale comes at a time when tech giants are competing aggressively for AI talent with lucrative compensation packages. Meta is notably investing billions in Scale AI and poached its 28-year-old CEO, Alexandr Wang, to lead its new super intelligence unit.

OpenAI has reportedly finalized a secondary share sale that values the artificial intelligence company at $500 billion, making the ChatGPT owner the world's most valuable startup ever. The share sale, which allows employees to cash out, comes just months after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that Meta Platforms (META) was poaching the company's AI staff with signing bonuses as high as $100 million. OpenAI's sky-high valuation suggests investor demand for AI plays, which has helped propel the major U.S. equities indexes to record highs, remains strong. According to Bloomberg, OpenAI's current and former employees sold about $6.6 billion in stock in a deal that has has vaulted the company past Elon Musk’s SpaceX to become the world’s largest startup. OpenAI had a $300 billion valuation earlier this year. Rocket company SpaceX is valued at $400 billion, Bloomberg said. Investors that bought into the secondary share sale—where investors buy from other investors rather than the company—included Japan's SoftBank, which put forth $30 billion in a funding round earlier this year. Thrive Capital, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi’s MGX, and T. Rowe Price also snapped up shares, the report said. OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft (MSFT), is the latest of a string of AI startups to have seen valuations soar as investors are eager for exposure ahead of potential market entries. Nvidia (NVDA) also said last month that it plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI to build out AI data centers. Nvidia, the chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom, has a market capitalization of well over $4 trillion, making it the world's most valuable publicly listed company. OpenAI didn't immediately respond to an Investopedia request for comment.

The sale pushed OpenAI’s total valuation to $500 billion, the highest ever achieved by a privately held company. Purchasers included SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group, Thrive Capital, MGX, and T. Rowe Price, the report said. The sale was not a conventional funding round, as the cash went to individuals holding shares or options in OpenAI rather than the company’s own coffers. Still, it’s a powerful retention tool for the company, which has faced significant pressure from Meta’s newly revitalized AI lab. This summer, Meta poached at least seven top engineers from OpenAI, often luring them away with multimillion-dollar signing bonuses. OpenAI’s most recent funding round came in August, when it completed a $40 billion fundraise at a $300 billion valuation. SoftBank, Thrive, T. Rowe Price, and Dragoneer were also investors in that round, as well as private equity firms like Blackstone and TPG, and major venture capitalists like Founders Fund, Sequoia Capital, and Andreessen Horowitz. The sale is also a reminder of OpenAI’s ability to raise cash as needed — a particularly important resource given the company’s ambitious infrastructure plans. OpenAI has committed to spending $300 billion on Oracle Cloud Services over the next five years, a sum that vastly outstrips its current revenue or reserves. However, the powerful momentum of the company’s fundraising suggests it’s not as outlandish as standard arithmetic would indicate. In September, Nvidia announced a plan to invest $100 billion in OpenAI as part of a strategic infrastructure partnership. The new sale comes just weeks after a non-binding agreement between OpenAI and Microsoft, which many saw as paving the way for OpenAI’s conversion into a for-profit entity. But OpenAI’s conversion has not yet been confirmed in court, and the new sales could cause significant complications if the conversion fails to proceed as planned. OpenAI continues to develop and launch products at a blistering pace, releasing its latest Sora 2 video model and accompanying social media feed earlier this week. The company reported $4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025, while burning through $2.5 billion in cash.

It seems like it's AI or nothing. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The explosion of generative AI over the last few years signals a change in the job market alongside it, and this brings with it worries of job instability and losses. With big players like Nvidia, Meta, X, and the governments worldwide further committing to AI, questions are posed to those at the very top. In a recent interview with the British news channel, Channel 4, Nvidia's CEO Jensun Huang, gave his thoughts on what's next. He says, "If you're an electrician, if you're a plumber, if you're a carpenter, we're going to need hundreds of thousands of them. To build all of these factories." Huang argues, "The skilled craft segment of every economy is going to boom". "You're going to have to build. You're going to keep doubling and doubling… every single year." Just last week, Nvidia shared plans to spend $100 billion on OpenAI. This cash is intended to go towards greater supplies of data centre chips, to further train upcoming AI models. Just weeks before that, Nvidia's earnings report showed it made almost 10 times more from AI than gaming. Nvidia's stock price is also at an all-time high, over 10 times what it was half a decade ago. CEO of US chip giant Nvidia, Jensen Huang, tells Channel 4 News, that ‘electricians and plumbers’ will be the big winners in the AI race as the skilled craft segment of every economy is going to see a 'boom'. #Tech #AI #Nvidia #Economy #C4News OpenAI's spending has also skyrocketed, alongside ChatGPT's popularity, and the US government is firmly behind cementing "US dominance in artificial intelligence". From a PC gaming perspective, we've even seen brands like Razer jump on the AI bandwagon. This is all to say AI doesn't appear to be going away, and it has backing in the hundreds of billions. When asked what could happen if the UK doesn't 'grasp this opportunity', Huang says, "just as the last industrial revolution, the reason why it came about was because you needed it. And so the industrial revolution that started here in the UK came out of need. You need it now, too." Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Earlier this year, the UK's Department for Science, Innovation and Technology signed an agreement with OpenAI to push the chatbot into the public sector in a further bid to make the UK an AI powerhouse. Though highlighting future employment seems relevant to current fears around the job market, this doesn't address those who have degrees and experience in fields being replaced. Senator Bernie Sanders argued in June that "Artificial intelligence is going to displace millions and millions of workers". A month after this, OpenAI's Sam Altman shared that he thinks some jobs will be "totally, totally gone" due to AI. A former Google executive in August argued AI will lead to a "short-term dystopia" because it will struggle to create new jobs for those it is replacing. Huang tells reporters, "You're going to be building out AI infrastructure here in the UK for a decade," but it's not clear what the plan is for workers after that. 1.

Title: ChatGPT Shopping: How to Get AI to Recommend Your Products
URL: https://backlinko.com/chatgpt-shopping-optimization
Time Published: 2025-10-02T14:05:17Z
Full Content:
A 14-day trial for premium features. 55+ tools.Free access for core features. Backlinko readers getaccess for 14 days. 55+ tools. Written by Yongi Barnard ChatGPT recommends products — complete with photos, pricing, and purchase links — to its 700 million weekly users. And now customers can complete purchases without leaving the chat. BIG deal. But will ChatGPT recommend your products? That’s not automatic. And you can’t pay for placement. What you can do is optimize your site so ChatGPT understands what you sell, trusts your brand, and surfaces your products when buyers search. This guide shows you how. You’ll learn the eight-step framework for getting featured in ChatGPT Shopping. I also spoke with Leigh McKenzie, Backlinko’s Head of Growth and founder of the ecommerce brand UnderFit, to get his insights on what’s actually working. First, let’s look at how ChatGPT decides which products make the cut. ChatGPT Shopping kicks in automatically for some shopping intent prompts. While it doesn’t fire every time, I found it appears more often than not after testing 100+ prompts. The key? Typing a prompt with clear buying intent. Like “e-bikes that can handle potholes.” Instead of just explaining things or offering advice, ChatGPT Shopping recommends specific products. This includes product images, pricing, and links to online stores and websites where users can make a purchase. Side note: The ChatGPT Shopping experience isn’t consistent. Even with the same prompt, the carousel may (or may not) show. It can also appear at the top, middle, or bottom of the chat. This variability suggests the feature is still evolving. If your store gets recommended, countless high-intent shoppers will see your products. For example, when I tested the e-bike query, ChatGPT gave me a brief explanation of what features to prioritize. But it also provided a visual product carousel with eight products, each in its own card with key details. (It looks similar to Google Shopping ads, except you don’t have to pay for them.) Clicking on any card opens a side panel with: From there, users simply click “Visit” to reach the merchant’s product page. But this experience is changing. As of September 2025, OpenAI is rolling out Instant Checkout — a feature that lets shoppers buy directly inside ChatGPT. This is a huge shift. ChatGPT is no longer just a product discovery tool. It’s a full shopping destination. Right now, Instant Checkout is only available to Etsy sellers in the United States. But OpenAI plans to expand this feature to Shopify merchants and other countries soon. Not on either platform? They’re also accepting applications for merchants to build their own integrations. (More on this in Step #7.) A shopper describes what they’re looking for (“running shoes with arch support under $150”), and ChatGPT’s AI goes to work. It scans the web for the most relevant products based on that request. And weighs details like product names, descriptions, features, reviews, brand authority, and other signals to find the best matches. If your product checks the right boxes — and the information on your site is clear and crawlable — it has a chance to be recommended. ChatGPT may also consider the user’s location and preferences when making recommendations. Ultimately, all product recommendations must also pass through OpenAI’s safety systems. This filters out low-quality, misleading, or unsafe products. So, what does all of this mean for you? ChatGPT Shopping is evolving fast — and the brands that keep up will win the most visibility. Here’s how to ensure ChatGPT can understand, trust, and recommend your products. ChatGPT needs structured data to understand what you sell. Schema markup is code that labels key details on your product pages (and website as a whole): name, price, description, availability, reviews, and more. It turns raw HTML into data AI tools can parse instantly. Without it, ChatGPT (and other AI systems) have to guess what’s on your page. With it, they see clean, structured information they can confidently include in product recommendations. At a minimum, your product schema should include: It may look intimidating, but many content management systems — like WordPress, Shopify, and Wix — offer plugins or built-in tools that generate the markup for you automatically. Once your markup is in place, test that it’s working correctly using Google’s Rich Results Test or Schema.org’s validator. These tools make it easy to check that your structured data is valid, visible, and error-free. Pro tip: Go beyond the schema basics. Add AggregateRating for average review scores or FAQPage markup to answer common buyer questions. The more context you provide, the easier it is for AI to surface your product in response to specific prompts. A product feed is a structured file that packages up your product details and sends them to platforms like Google Merchant Center, Shopify, and Etsy. It includes details like titles, prices, availability, images, links, and more. ChatGPT may use data from major platforms like Google to decide which products to recommend. Pro tip: Want to add your product feed directly to ChatGPT? OpenAI will notify interested merchants when this feature is available. Fill out the Merchant Application form for consideration. For example, if your Google Shopping feed is outdated, incomplete, or inaccurate, ChatGPT may return bad information about your products. Or skip recommending them entirely. That’s why a high-quality, up-to-date product feed is critical. Side note: If you’re on an ecommerce platform like WooCommerce or Shopify, feeds are usually created automatically. But keeping feeds accurate is easier said than done. There are a lot of moving parts, like site updates, refresh schedules, and third-party tools. And it only takes one slip for mismatches to creep in. Here are a few common product feed issues — and how to fix them: Automation keeps most updates in sync. And manual checks before major launches or sales help catch anything that may slip through. Here’s how Leigh maintains a balance of the two for his ecommerce store: “I keep all my product data in a spreadsheet. Whenever I change a product detail, I update it there first. WooCommerce uses that data to update my site’s pages and schema automatically. Then, Channable takes the same spreadsheet and syncs those updates into my product feeds. That way, my site and my feeds are always pulling from the same source, so everything stays consistent.” If ChatGPT can’t read your site, it can’t recommend your products. Two simple technical issues block many ecommerce sites from showing up: hidden content and restricted crawlers. Many AI bots — including ChatGPT — still struggle with content that only loads via JavaScript. If key details aren’t in the page’s raw HTML, the bot might never see them. This includes your product descriptions, prices, and images. Eek. Here’s how to check if that’s happening: If your product details disappear, it means they’re only loading through JavaScript. To fix this, work with a developer to ensure all essential information is in your site’s raw HTML. Your robots.txt file can also block AI crawlers. This small file tells bots which parts of your site they can (and can’t) crawl. By default, most sites already allow all bots, including ChatGPT’s crawler, OAI-SearchBot. But it’s still worth double-checking. Here’s how: First, go to yourdomain.com/robots.txt. Then, look for a rule like this: And this: If it says “Disallow,” then ChatGPT is unable to crawl your site. You (or your dev team) can fix this issue by changing it to “allow.” Further reading: 23 Best Large Language Models ChatGPT matches products to prompts by language, not keywords. So, if your product copy doesn’t sound like the way people talk, it may not surface in shopping results. The goal: write the way buyers phrase their prompts. You don’t have to guess how your customers talk. Use research tools like: Look for modifiers that mimic real queries — terms like “best,” “for beginners,” “eco-friendly,” or “kid-friendly.” Tools like Semrush’s AI SEO Toolkit show you the actual prompts people type into AI engines. So, instead of manually guessing or testing one by one, you get a ready-made list of conversational queries buyers already use. Once you understand how your audience speaks, weave the terms naturally into your product titles and descriptions. This will increase the odds of your products showing up in ChatGPT when shoppers search. Further reading: 11 Awesome ChatGPT Alternatives to Try When you’re writing copy, pay special attention to your product titles. They often feed directly into the shopping carousel. And they’re the first thing shoppers see before deciding to click. The golden rule: Lead with what matters most to your audience. If trust drives decisions — like in categories such as laptops or smartphones — put your brand front and center. If features, benefits, or use cases are more important, focus on those instead. Use this simple formula: [Main Benefit or Feature] + [Product Type] (+ [Brand] if it builds trust) On Leigh’s site, for example, his titles highlight what buyers care about most: product benefits. That’s why they’re structured as Benefit (Invisible) + Product Type (Undershirt). But when brand recognition is vital to trust, it makes sense to include the brand name. Like this product title for a Sony home theater: Don’t worry about cramming every detail into the title. Most ecommerce platforms give you multiple fields for product info. Use those strategically to sprinkle in conversational keywords. Titles get people to click. Descriptions get them to buy. This is where you expand on features, benefits, and use cases — all in plain, natural language. For example, UnderFit’s product copy mirrors the words buyers use when searching for an undershirt. These words aren’t filler — they’re search terms. Which means they’re likely the same language people use when prompting ChatGPT. Your product’s value proposition needs to be clear and visible at the top of your product page. This ensures ChatGPT immediately understands: But that’s not enough. The rest of your page should support and reinforce that promise. This gives ChatGPT a complete picture of your product. And helps it see your product as the best fit for the query. This means every section — features, benefits, reviews, specs — should back up your value proposition with proof and detail. Huel’s Black Edition product page is a great example of this in action. The value proposition is right under the product title: “High Protein Complete Meal.” This instantly explains: The image reinforces this by highlighting complementary copy: “This is a meal. Not a protein shake” and “40g protein per meal.” The product description repeats the promise yet again: “40 grams of protein.” But it also adds details like “27 essential vitamins and minerals.” This repetition is exactly what you want. While you can (and should) use word variety, your page should tell one clear story from top to bottom. Explain what the product is, why it’s valuable, and how it delivers on that promise. So, audit your site. If copy and images don’t reinforce your core message, rework them until it does. The more consistent and focused your messaging is, the easier it is for ChatGPT to understand (and recommend) your products. Further reading: How to Use AI for Writing Exceptional Content (7 Best Practices) ChatGPT doesn’t just look at your product page when deciding what to recommend. It cross-checks authority signals from across the web to figure out whether your brand (and your product) are trustworthy enough to recommend. These signals include: One way to see which sources matter most for your brand is to run a manual check in ChatGPT. Type a shopping prompt into the tool, scroll to the answer, and click “Sources.” The links you see there are the sites that ChatGPT used to pull its recommendations. (And, by extension, the sites it trusts.) For example, when I asked for a “yoga mat with serious grip for hot yoga,” ChatGPT cited: Use the sources as your roadmap. Target them with outreach strategies like expert quotes, partnerships, and co-branded content. Can’t land mentions on the exact sites ChatGPT cited? Go after similar ones with comparable authority. And build your presence on community platforms, too. A strong showing on Reddit, Quora, and niche Facebook groups can boost your brand’s credibility. Instant Checkout lets shoppers go from product recommendation to purchase without ever leaving ChatGPT. Once they find something they like, they can confirm details, pay, and place an order — all within the same chat window. (Hashtag mind blown) Instant Checkout currently supports single-item purchases in the U.S. on Etsy. (But Shopify integration is coming soon.) If you’re on either platform, you’re in luck. Eligibility is automatic. For everyone else? You’ll need to apply and integrate with OpenAI’s Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP). Translation: Roll up your sleeves. There’s work to do. Here’s what you can do now. Start by filling out OpenAI’s merchant application form. This lets OpenAI know you want in. They’re onboarding merchants on a rolling basis and will reach out when you’re accepted. Once you’re in the pipeline, you’ll need to: Pro tip: Even if ChatGPT Instant Checkout isn’t available for your store yet, preparing your product data, feeds, and backend now will help you move faster when it is. This should give you a head start as this feature gains popularity. It’s not enough to show up in ChatGPT Shopping. You also need to measure how well you’re performing. Start with tracking traffic. The easiest way is through OpenAI’s built-in UTM tag. This is code that OpenAI automatically adds to all outbound links. And looks like this: Set up a custom segment in Google Analytics to track and analyze ChatGPT traffic to your site. Once that’s done, look for patterns: Side note: Not every ChatGPT mention will be traceable. Some users see your product in a chat and search your brand directly on Google instead of clicking. Look for spikes in branded search traffic or direct visits to gauge the broader impact of LLMs. But traffic only tells you what happens after people click. You also need to measure what happens before — specifically, which prompts surface your products. To do this, it helps to understand the kinds of prompts shoppers type. Most fall into four buckets. Think of these buckets as templates. Test prompts in each category and ask yourself: Repeatedly run these checks to gather more data. You’ll learn which prompts lead to product mentions, how your LLM visibility changes, and how buyers talk about your brand. Rather automate this process? Tools like Semrush’s AI SEO Toolkit let you: There isn’t a magic formula for getting ChatGPT to recommend your products. But the brands that consistently get recommended all have three things in common: Get these right, and you’re not just optimizing for ChatGPT Shopping.

OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has reached a valuation of $500 billion, following a deal in which current and former employees sold roughly $6.6 billion worth of shares, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters today. This represents a bump-up from its current valuation of $300 billion, underscoring OpenAI's rapid gains in both users and revenue. Reuters reported details of the stock sale earlier in August. As part of the deal, OpenAI employees sold shares to a consortium of investors including Thrive Capital, SoftBank, Dragoneer Investment Group, Abu Dhabi's MGX and T Rowe Price, according to the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media. The company had authorised sales of $10-billion-plus worth of stock on the secondary market, the source added. Thrive Capital, SoftBank, Dragoneer, MGX and T Rowe Price did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. The share sale adds to SoftBank's earlier investment in OpenAI's $40 billion primary funding round. The company generated around $4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025, about 16% more than it generated all of last year, the Information reported earlier this week. The sale comes at a time when tech giants are competing aggressively for AI talent with lucrative compensation packages. Meta is notably investing billions in Scale AI and poached its 28-year-old CEO, Alexandr Wang, to lead its new super intelligence unit. Accreditation: Reuters © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Economy Candy: Three generations of sweets and success
URL: https://woocommerce.com/posts/economy-candy-custom-woocommerce/
Time Published: 2025-10-01T20:47:09Z
Full Content:
The WooCommerce Blog The WooCommerce Blog October 1, 2025 We recently got to visit Mitchell and Skye Cohen at Economy Candy to learn about the history of their business and how they use WooCommerce. While our team was in New York, we also filmed a short interview, which you can check out below or on our YouTube channel. Want the full story? Keep on reading for all of the sweet, sweet details of their success. 🍬🍭 Please note that some quotes have been edited for clarity and brevity. Economy Candy began in the 1930s as a penny sweets cart outside a shoe and hat repair shop in New York City. Since then, three generations of the Cohen family have turned the business into a Lower East Side mainstay — with the corner of Rivington and Essex named after Mitchell’s grandfather — and national distributor of goodies from around the world. Now, Mitchell Cohen and his wife, Skye Greenfield Cohen, continue that legacy. “Starting before he could even see over the counter, Mitchell would work with his dad behind the register standing on a milk crate, tallying bills and calculating the change in his head,” Skye shared. Skye has also continued an important tradition: ensuring that her husband continued the family business, just as Mitchell’s mother and grandmother had done for their husbands. Their most recent evolution included an upgraded ecommerce strategy in March of 2020. When they overhauled their website, which luckily happened just in time for Covid-19 closures, they also updated their store operations. Economy Candy brought nearly 2,500 SKUs into their online store, live syncing their inventory management, and began using a combination of shipping and local pickup options to keep their business going (and their customers happy) through the pandemic and beyond. Economy Candy has weathered significant worldwide and local catastrophes in its 88-year history, and yet, they’re still going strong. Their enduring presence is due in large part to their commitment to their customers, maintaining the accessibility of their products through all of the challenging times. Over the past five years, they’ve added nearly 500 new products to their inventory — which now boasts an astounding 2,500 different sweets and goodies. Getting to 2,500 SKUs, however, required an operational pivot: all of their inventory operations used to reside exclusively in Mitchell’s brain. “Up until the pandemic, all of Economy Candy’s inventory was stored in Mitchell’s head,” Skye shared. “Our staff had to memorize the prices of all 2,000+ items we carried because we were still using dumb cash registers where the price of each item had to be manually entered. In 2021 we took a leap into the 21st century and upgraded to Square digital registers.” Their modernization coincided with the pandemic, which exasperated the need for efficient (and online-friendly) inventory management. Not allowed to bring staff in-store, Mitchell and Skye moved all sales online, managing fulfillment themselves. In 2021, they added Square digital registers and implemented barcode scanning, using Thrive to sync in-store sales with their ecommerce business. Economy Candy has been online since the dawn of the millennium. In their hunt for a solution that didn’t feel restricted in functionality or growth, they switched platforms several times until 2015 — when they found WooCommerce. “When WooCommerce was presented to us, it was clear that limitations would no longer be an issue. Because WooCommerce is open source, there is no ceiling. There’s no limit to what you can do, what you can customize, what you can create. And it’s been great ever since.”— Skye Greenfield Cohen, Co-owner, Economy Candy Their WooCommerce store is responsible for 20 to 25% of their total sales each year, with seasonal spikes in traffic around the holidays. Thrive sits between WooCommerce and Economy Candy’s other third-party tools, and syncs sales data for in-store purchases, online transactions, and ShipStation. They’ve also integrated the site with UPS, FedEx, Route, Mailchimp, Google, and Meta. With a total of 57 active plugins and custom code, Economy Candy manages a complex network of tools and services. “It’s incredible the way that WooCommerce is able to talk to all these different programs.”— Skye Greenfield Cohen, Co-owner, Economy Candy One aspect that Mitchell and Skye love about WooCommerce is the breadth of options for customization — something that comes in handy when your products might melt during warmer seasons: “Shipping chocolate in the summer is tough. It is a challenge, but one thing that Woo has been great [for], there’s a myriad of popups and messages that you can easily set up.” “[For example,] I can set a warning,” noted Skye, “for anything that’s chocolate, put this text on that page so that the person ordering it knows that this is chocolate, there is a risk of melting. Do they want to add ice? Do they want to add cold packaging? So all those plugins [allow us to] set it and forget it… And it has really made shipping chocolate much less of a heartbreak.” Their focus on customer satisfaction has been the key to their success: “Economy Candy has survived for nearly 90 years on word of mouth,” Skye shared. “Of course, what ‘word of mouth’ means has changed a bit in the last century, from literal word of mouth to now including having our customers post about us on TikTok and Instagram and having a social media presence ourselves.” To inspire that organic promotion, they follow the rule of threes: If three people give the same feedback or request, they do their best to accommodate it. This often impacts their product and inventory decisions, from importing international sweets to making sure they stock candy from their oldest customers’ youth. They take a similar approach to new product decisions, considering the selection from the customer’s point of view: Would the customer be excited to see it in store, or has someone requested something similar? Is it a unique product that they haven’t seen before? Mitchell and Skye are also mindful of future generations of their audience. Their Gen Z staff members help them stay up to date on TikTok trends and viral sweets, such as Swedish candy, freeze-dried candy, and slime lickers. As the business grows, Economy Candy continues to play to WooCommerce’s strengths. Taking advantage of all of the customization options, Mitchell and Skye know that they can change direction whenever the need arises. “Being able to pivot without recreating your website from scratch every few years, which we used to do — now we’re making tweaks on an existing platform instead of starting from scratch, and that saves a lot of money, a lot of time.”— Mitchell Cohen, Co-owner, Economy Candy “With WooCommerce as the central foothold of our platform and adding pieces around that, … EconomyCandy.com is customized to what EconomyCandy.com needs to be for Economy Candy customers and for Economy Candy staff to be able to operate on the backend. We are able to put in all those custom functionalities that work for our specific business.” About Ship your WooCommerce orders with confidence, save on top carriers, and automate your processes with ShipStation.

Title: Morgan Stanley: Adobe’s Future at Risk Due to AI
URL: https://petapixel.com/2025/10/01/morgan-stanley-adobes-future-at-risk-due-to-ai/
Time Published: 2025-10-01T19:31:25Z
Full Content:
Morgan Stanley has downgraded Adobe’s stock rating, cutting its price target for the software giant amidst a perceived inability to stand out amidst the rise of generative AI. According to a report from The Street, top Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss noted a growing gap between Adobe’s AI development (and promises) and reported revenue in its Digital Media division. “Since that upgrade, we have seen the Digital Media annual recurring revenue (ARR) growth directionality diverge from the pace and quality of innovation being embedded within the product portfolio,” Weiss writes in his report. The full report notes that Adobe’s revenue which it can tie directly to its AI-based efforts has been lagging, and monetization is going slowly. Compounding issues are growing from competitors like Canva, Google, and Meta, who all have introduced AI-based features that they can more directly tie to revenue growth. As a result, Morgan Stanley lowered their price target for Adobe from $520 to $450. It doesn’t look like it’s close to even hitting that lower mark, however, as the stock has been steadily falling in the past couple of weeks. It hit $353 per share on September 24 and sits at $344 on October 1. Adobe’s current weakened situation is likely a product of its own making. For the last year, Adobe has been shouting loudly about its AI development and the power of its in-house generative AI platform, Firefly. However, after updates and iterations, Firefly remains significantly behind competitors in terms of usefulness. While its select subject and remove tools have become a lot better over the last couple of months, for most of the year, its generative tools have been downright ghastly, resulting in Eldritch nightmares that don’t solve the problems they should. Its AI-based generative video tool is still far from being usable. The AI situation at Adobe has been so behind that the company recently opened up its platform to use other Generative AI tools — most recently Nano Banana — diminishing the value of its “responsible” AI to the degree that Adobe seems less concerned with it now than ever, especially as pressure mounts to make good on its AI-based revenue promises. In June, Adobe finally started tracking generative AI use through its apps via credits, which will very likely be an indicator that Adobe can use to tie AI to revenue. But if those numbers aren’t high and showing an upward trend, investors still won’t be happy. That’s tricky for the software company, as the main users of its Digital Media division are still artists, many of whom are less than happy with the proliferation of generative AI that has been trained on human work, effectively stealing knowledge so it can be sold back to them. Adobe is not wholly beloved by its customers either, who regularly clamor for someone else to step in and give Adobe competition. Its recent foray into social media network Bluesky is the best example of how Adobe’s customers feel as the company was hit with so much backlash after joining that it was effectively forced off the platform.

Title: Contrarians Only: A “Flash” Sale On Our Top AI Dividend
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/10/01/contrarians-only-a-flash-sale-on-our-top-ai-dividend/
Time Published: 2025-10-01T15:24:00Z
Full Content:
ByBrett Owens, Contributor. We contrarians live for the “one-off” shots at extra income (or gains!) our favorite AI dividend plays throw our way. One of these “special situations” just landed in our lap: A shot at buying a megatrend-powered 7.6% dividend that’s rarely cheap. And we’re picking it up for a song. It’s a long-time holding of our Contrarian Income Report advisory, and it’s sitting right in the tracks of the surging AI buildout. In fact, it may be the last “cheap” AI play on the board! This one’s dropped from trading for more than its portfolio is worth to a lot less. As you can see, this fund dropped from trading 6% above its net asset value (NAV, or the per-share value of its portfolio) to 7.1% below, as of this writing. It’s a huge drop, and it stands out because, as you can see above, this fund, the 7.6%-yielding Cohen & Steers Infrastructure Fund (UTF), is rarely cheap for long. UTF’s latest tour in our Contrarian Income Report portfolio started in November 2020, and this reliable utility fund has been humming away since, handing us a 7.8% yield on our original buy, plus a monthly payout that’s rolled in like clockwork. That’s exactly what we bought it to do. And it’s handed us a 41% total return in that time, too. And now we have a shot at buying it cheaper than we did five years ago! Let me put all of this in dollars and cents for you. In the past year, UTF’s average premium has been 1.8%. If the discount reverts to that level, price upside of around 10% is on the table here. And that’s before we factor in the growth of its portfolio. Let’s talk about that now. We bought UTF in late 2020 because its utility-stock holdings—including big players like NextEra Energy (NEE), Duke Energy (DUK) and Southern Co. (CO)—are essentially “bond proxies.” When rates fall, as they did then, utilities rise. Nowadays, we have a similar setup. As we discussed in last week’s article on some of our favorite gold dividends, long rates are essentially capped, and short-term rates (controlled by the Fed) are falling. Plus we have another, far bigger driver: AI’s limitless power demand. Let’s take Texas, ground zero for the AI power boom. Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) have built data centers there. According to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), Texas alone expects a 62% surge in power demand by 2030 as these data centers multiply. That’s just one state, utilities nationwide are racing to add capacity. To be sure, this AI-utility trade is far from a secret, so why the discount on UTF? Look at the chart below. In orange, we have UTF’s total NAV return (again, the value of its underlying portfolio) for 2025. In purple we see its total return based on market price (or what investors are paying for the fund itself on the open market). As you can see, the total NAV return has continued its climb. The market-price return, meantime, has dropped, carving out that 7.1% “discount gap.” This is the kind of sign we contrarians love because it shows that this discount is not because management blew a stock selection (or many). It’s all about investor sentiment. And we’re happy to take the other side of the bet when investors turn bearish on a solid fund like this one. Why the sour mood? UTF’s management firm, Cohen & Steers, is doing something CEF managers rarely do: conducting a “transferable rights offering” on the fund. Under this setup, if you held shares of UTF as of the “record date”—September 22—you get one “right” to buy new shares at a discount: Every five rights lets you buy one new UTF share. Here’s how that will work: When the offer expires on October 16, the price of the new shares will be set at 95% of the stock’s average closing price on that date and the four trading days leading up to it. If the fund’s average price is below 90% of its NAV—again, the per-share value of its underlying portfolio—the price will be set at 90% of NAV. That “floor” helps limit the offer’s downside pressure on the shares. If you owned UTF as of September 22, you’ll be able to exercise your rights and even more, if there are leftover shares other investors don’t pick up. If you don’t want to get in on the action here, that’s fine—you can sell your rights—hence the “transferable” in the name. All of the details of the rights offering are on C&S’s website. All of this, in a nutshell, is why UTF has dropped to a discount.. But how do I know this is a buying opportunity? Let’s look at history. I did say earlier that rights offerings were rare for CEFs, but on March 19, Nuveen announced a similar deal on its Nuveen Credit Strategies Income Fund (JQC). JQS’s discount deepened on the offer’s announcement, then ground back toward its norm when the expiry date rolled around. I expect the same with UTF’s AI tailwind, capped interest rates and management’s ability to sniff out winning infrastructure plays. And thanks to the rights offering, they’ll have even more cash to work with. If you own UTF, this is your chance to buy more at a bargain. If not, you still get to buy a rarely cheap fund for 93 cents on the dollar—and ride its closing “discount gap” higher. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: CoreWeave Stock To $250?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/01/coreweave-stock-to-250/
Time Published: 2025-10-01T13:22:50Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CoreWeave stock (NASDAQ:CRWV) exhibited an impressive performance increase of 12% on September 30, 2025, following the announcement of a groundbreaking $14.2 billion partnership with Meta Platforms, affirming the organization’s position as a leading AI infrastructure provider. The seven-year agreement with Meta, which extends through December 2031 with the potential for expansion into 2032, signifies a strategic diversification success for CoreWeave. Having been reliant on Microsoft for roughly 70% of its revenue, this partnership fundamentally alters CoreWeave’s risk related to client concentration while illustrating the scalability of its specialized GPU infrastructure model. The partnership guarantees Meta access to CoreWeave’s Nvidia GB300 server racks, each outfitted with 72 of Nvidia’s advanced Blackwell AI GPUs, establishing CoreWeave as Meta’s infrastructure partner for forthcoming AI workloads. This agreement comes on the heels of CoreWeave’s recent $6.5 billion expansion with OpenAI, raising the total contracted revenue with OpenAI to $22.4 billion and creating a varied blue-chip client portfolio. We elaborate further on this development and CoreWeave’s valuation in the sections below. That being said, if you’re looking for a less volatile investment than holding a single stock like CRWV, you might consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has realized returns surpassing 91% since its inception. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; avoiding a tumultuous experience, as demonstrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics. In addition, refer to – Wait For A Dip To Buy Hims & Hers Health Stock Meta’s dedication grants CoreWeave unparalleled revenue visibility and confirms the company’s specialized “AI Hyperscaler” strategy. As Meta actively enhances its investments in AI infrastructure—with capital expenditures anticipated between $66-72 billion for 2025—CoreWeave becomes an essential infrastructure provider for one of the largest AI spenders in the tech industry. The agreement bolsters CoreWeave’s competitive advantage against hyperscale cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud by showcasing that specialized AI infrastructure can command premium pricing and foster client loyalty. CoreWeave’s current market capitalization of approximately $70 billion and its current revenue base of $3.5 billion indicate that the company trades at roughly 19 times trailing revenue—a compelling multiple considering its rapid growth trajectory. For context, CoreWeave's revenue is projected to increase over 3.5 times, nearing approximately $18 billion by 2027. Does this imply the company’s valuation will decrease to under 4 times sales, assuming the stock price stays stable? We do not think so. Even at a more conservative 8 times revenues, the company’s valuation would likely surpass $145 billion, representing more than a doubling from current levels in the next three years. Indeed, this valuation seems conservative when compared to other high-growth technology stocks that trade at considerably higher revenue multiples. For instance, among AI and Data Infrastructure Leaders, Snowflake trades at around 18x revenue despite slower 28% growth rates, while Palantir commands a 124x revenue multiple with a 39% growth rate. In the realm of High-Growth SaaS Companies, Palo Alto Networks trades at a 15x revenue multiple, and HubSpot at a 10x multiple. There are numerous other comparable examples. CoreWeave’s recent achievements authenticate our previous forecasts of substantial upside potential, with the stock rising 47% over the last month and more than tripling since its IPO in March 2025 at $40 per share. The company’s revenue growth of 206% year-over-year in Q2 2025, reaching $1.213 billion with 62% adjusted EBITDA margins, showcases significant operational leverage at scale. With a contracted backlog of $30.1 billion offering multi-year revenue predictability and nearly 50% anticipated to be realized within 24 months, CoreWeave presents investors with both growth and certainty—an unusual pairing in high-growth technology stocks. The partnership with Meta reinforces CoreWeave’s thesis as the specialized infrastructure layer driving the AI revolution, positioning the company for sustained growth as enterprise AI adoption accelerates across various verticals. Naturally, we could be incorrect in our evaluations, and investors should carefully consider the risks prior to investing in CRWV stock. The primary risks associated with CoreWeave revolve around its financial stability and market standing. Specifically, the company confronts substantial challenges stemming from fierce competition with major cloud providers and the possibility of market cyclicality in AI spending. From an operational perspective, CoreWeave has a -29% net margin and a $15 billion debt burden necessary for significant infrastructure investments, compounded by a critical customer concentration risk with major clients such as OpenAI. It’s important to recognize that investing in a single stock without thorough analysis can be perilous. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to generate strong returns for investors. What accounts for this success? The quarterly rebalanced combination of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks has offered a dynamic means to capitalize on favorable market conditions while minimizing losses when the markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Pseudonymous X user Buzzlamic Jihad, who is called Buzz by his friends and family, told Decrypt that he hopes to address Aptos’ image problem and position it as a premium stablecoin network—harking back to the original Libra vision from Facebook in which Aptos was founded. He said that one way he aims to do this is by leveraging his personal connections with the co-founders of the President Trump-backed World Liberty Financial, two of whom were mentors to the shitposter. "Buzz is an inventor and true Aptos missionary through and through,” Ash Pampati, head of ecosystem at Aptos, told Decrypt. “I'm excited for him to come on board as an advisor to expand everyone's imagination of what is truly possible only on Aptos.” Aptos looking good here https://t.co/eTQrNlu1ga — 🐝 (🌐/acc) (@BuzzlamicJihad) September 14, 2025 Back in February, Buzz was partly responsible for a 17% pump for Aptos' APT token as the crypto community started to notice the memes he had been posting for months. The then-little-known social media user had been spamming “Aptos lookin’ good here,” “sidelined?” and “motion not priced in yet” in unwavering support for the layer-1 blockchain. These phrases have since become canonical crypto memes, with major crypto figures and companies embracing them. The buzz, pardon the pun, was so effective that Pampati told Decrypt in May it helped to revive developer interest in the network, in an unexpected display of the power of memes. Aptos looking good here This is just the last 24h pic.twitter.com/pagwYwZ1nD — 🐝 (🌐/acc) (@BuzzlamicJihad) February 16, 2025 At the time, people wondered how a seemingly random X user could have such a large impact. It turns out Buzz has a history in growth marketing, specializing in Facebook advertising, and claims to have generated millions with this venture. During that period, Buzz told Decrypt, he was mentored by Chase Herro and Zak Folkman, successful Facebook marketers who went on to co-found World Liberty Financial. At one point, Buzz said he lived with the pair in Puerto Rico and was briefly their business partner. Given his history with Facebook, now Meta, Buzz explained that he was immediately attracted to Aptos as it was formed by developers from Libra—a now-defunct stablecoin project led by Facebook. The deeper he dug, the more he liked about Aptos, and he started posting about it under the pseudonym Buzzlamic Jihad. After the February pump, Buzz claims he was offered a role in marketing at Aptos but turned it down. Over the coming months, he continued conversations with the Aptos team and has now signed a deal to become an advisor. In many ways, Buzz joining Aptos as an advisor is comparable to if meme stock influencer Keith “Roaring Kitty” Gill joined GameStop—a rumor that once circulated on the internet. As the possibility of joining Aptos emerged, Buzz reached out to Folkman after years of not being in contact and told him, “Let’s run it back.” He helped connect Folkman with Aptos CEO Avery Ching, with the pair meeting at the White House crypto summit in March. Following this interaction, and without further help from Buzz, World Liberty Financial agreed to list its USD1 stablecoin on Aptos—which was announced in October at Token2049 in Singapore. BREAKING: @DonaldJTrumpJr & @ZachWitkoff just announced that @worldlibertyfi's USD1 is coming to @Aptos as the first Move based deployment. Our teams share a united mission of building the best financial infrastructure for 🇺🇸 and the world. Much more to come… 🦅🌐 https://t.co/DjxBvviJts pic.twitter.com/0P3YfSaY63 — avery.apt 🇺🇸 (@AveryChing) October 1, 2025 But this is just the beginning, Buzz told Decrypt. He intends to continue to leverage his relationship with the World Liberty Financial team to attract “net new buyers” to Aptos, fix its image, and position it as a premium stablecoin network. He went on to hint at bigger potential collaborations to come, although nothing is set in stone. “I think it's very relevant right now because you see chains like Plasma, they’re doing very well. Everyone was talking about them. Now you even have Circle, they’re launching the Tempo blockchain,” Buzz said, referencing the Plasma stablecoin network. “They’re basically doing Libra 2.0 … so the idea is validated. Aptos has the technology, it’s just frustrating that they don’t have the right messaging.” Now officially working for Aptos, Buzz hopes to have a direct hand in fixing this messaging. He also told Decrypt that he has some “bigger goals” which, if he achieves, he will be paid more for. That’s not to mention that he’s requested that he be paid entirely in APT tokens, as a sign of his belief in the network. After making his name by asking people if they’re sidelined, Buzz is finally no longer sidelined himself. “I am trying to community takeover,” Buzz told Decrypt. “That started as a meme, but as it progressed, I’m like, ‘Maybe it's actually possible. Could I actually do this?’,” he said, adding, “This isn’t a joke anymore. I’m actually working on it.” “It’s lookin' good here,” he finished.

Manage all your social accounts in one place Find high-quality content and viral post ideas Design images with stock media editing tools Classify your posts into topic-based buckets Compose, customize and preview your posts Automate your social publishing schedule Evaluate post performance and engagement Create and manage posts on your phone Struggling to figure out which social media management tools for agencies are actually worth it? Most tools look great on the surface — until you try to onboard five clients, publish across 10 platforms, and collaborate with your team… all while staying under budget. That’s when the cracks show. You hit limits on users. Scheduling posts takes forever. You still have to chase down content ideas. And don’t even get us started on clunky approval workflows or missing analytics. What agencies really need is a tool that’s: After testing dozens of social media management tools for agencies, I narrowed it down to these top 9 — each ranked by what they do best. Managing multiple clients or brands? You can’t afford to waste hours every week bouncing between content folders, caption drafts, and platforms. That’s where Post Planner shines. It’s a social media management tool built to help agencies find, create, schedule, and recycle high-performing content across every major social network — without the price tag or complexity of other platforms. You can schedule content across: And the best part? It’s one of the most affordable tools on this list (even when you need more users and social accounts). Here's a demo video that shows just how simple it is to use: Post Planner offers 4 main pricing plans: Visit our pricing page for more details on each plan. Post Planner mainly receives 4-5 stars across online review platforms. Customers love the time they save scheduling their posts with Post Planner's easy-to-navigate UI. More critical reviews mention that they wish more advanced reporting features were available. Here's what Aubrey C. has to say about using Post Planner: “This program is an absolute LIFE SAVER. As a person who runs multiple clients, I needed something that saved me time because I work a full-time day job in addition to my freelance services. I was looking for something affordable, user-friendly, and quick to learn on my own. I got all of those things but learning on my own wasn't necessary. The team is extremely responsive via text chat and they have plenty of training. Aside from that, this program helped me optimize my work and the post batching is potentially my favorite part. I love that there's an app for me to use in addition to my desktop. It makes it very easy for me to use no matter where I'm at. On a personal note, the customer service was better than most places these days. They were responsive, supportive, and encouraging, not to mention extremely helpful and kind. A business like theirs will always get my advocacy and money going forward. Many thanks for everything, Post Planner!” If your agency manages lots of clients or publishes across a high volume of social media profiles, SocialPilot is built for you. It’s a robust, client-ready platform with built-in team collaboration, white-label dashboards, bulk scheduling, and approval workflows. Even better? You get a lot of those premium features for less than you’d pay for other enterprise-level competitors. While it doesn’t include content discovery like Post Planner, it’s a great fit for agencies that already have their content strategy dialed in — and need a clean system to manage the execution. SocialPilot offers 4 main pricing plans: SocialPilot mostly receives 4-5 stars across online reviews. Customers love the value you get for the price, especially if they manage a lot of accounts. Finding many complaints was a struggle, although some mentioned occasional scheduling errors. Here's what Nyika S. has to say about using SocialPilot: “I'm happy with it. The pricing is better than Hootsuite which is what I used before; and it's almost as easy to use. I liked how easy it was to 1. add my team members 2. on-board them (platform is easy to learn) and 3. post and schedule content. I can also easily repost content previously scheduled. Pricing packages are slightly rigid- I am in between packages but I have to go with the more expensive one so I don't miss out on features. There is an inability to add a channel the same way you add a team member. I am optimistic this will be added soon.” Sprout Social is the Swiss Army knife of social media management — especially for agencies that need serious reporting, cross-platform coordination, and team workflows. It’s loaded with features: smart inboxes, sentiment analysis, employee advocacy, influencer tracking, publishing tools, and fully customizable analytics dashboards. But all that power comes at a cost. Sprout Social is one of the most expensive tools on this list — which makes it better suited for larger agencies or high-ticket clients where granular insights and premium reporting are non-negotiable. Sprout Social has 4 main pricing plans: Since Sprout Social was one of the first social media management tools, it has collected thousands of online reviews, mostly between 4-5 stars. Customers love that it's loaded with plenty of advanced features like the Smart Inbox and reports. The high cost is one of the few dislikes some customers mention. Here's what one verified user has to say about using Sprout Social: "As a smaller company with a solo social marketer, Sprout enables us to scale our social presence with purpose and ease. The unified inbox is a game-changer - I'm able to see all mentions, comments, and messages across all of our platforms and it saves hours. Implementation was easy, reporting is professional grade and the interface is intuitive. The biggest drawback of Sprout Social is the price. The base cost is already on the higher end, and then crucial features like social listening are locked behind an even more expensive add-on. This is frustrating, because listening is essential for proactive strategy, but it feels like it’s priced for enterprise budgets only. For a tool that does so much right, it’s disappointing that such a core feature isn’t included or available at a more accessible tier. So we have to maintain a separate, more affordable tool to fill that gap." If your agency juggles multiple clients and approval rounds, Planable was made for you. It turns messy email threads and spreadsheet calendars into one simple, visual platform — where your team and clients can draft, comment, approve, and publish content without the back-and-forth. It’s especially useful for agencies that prioritize client collaboration and fast review cycles. Just note: while Planable excels at internal workflows, it doesn’t offer content discovery or curation tools. So it’s better suited for agencies that already have content ready to go. Planable offers 4 main pricing plans: Paid plans come with unlimited users. Planable mostly receives 4-5 stars across customer reviews online. Users commonly praise its collaboration abilities and its simplicity. Meanwhile, one common thing reviewers criticize is its lack of reporting abilities. Here's what Andrea has to say about using Planable: "Planable has truly changed how we manage our content and social media strategy execution. For me, it’s an all-in-one social media management platform that makes planning and scheduling both visual and intuitive. I can see our content calendar, drag and drop posts, and collaborate in real time. I would say that the value of Planable is its efficiency and ease of use. Everything happens in one place. It helps our small team work like a big one: structured, aligned, and fast. I can’t recommend it enough." Hootsuite has long been a go-to platform for agencies managing complex client needs — especially when it comes to customer interaction, social listening, and paid campaign management. What makes it especially strong for agencies is the ability to engage directly with followers across platforms using a centralized inbox, plus advanced features for ad management, sentiment analysis, and employee advocacy. That said, the price tag is steep — and some users report customer service hiccups. If your agency doesn’t need deep listening or paid social workflows, more affordable tools will give you better ROI. Hootsuite has 3 main pricing plans available: Most Hootsuite customers rate it 4 or 5 stars across review sites. Customers value its social media management and team collaboration features. One of the most common complaints is its higher pricing. Here's what Taylor has to say about using Hootsuite: "I am excited about using Hootsuite because of the social media benchmarking and social listening. One thing that I've noticed since using the product is that customer service doesn't respond to chats, the social media platform analytics are not accurate (I have to go to Meta or Linkedin directly for accurate numbers on impressions and likes), and Hootsuite doesn't seem to see when I check the inbox (I got a message recently saying that if I didn't use the inbox within 5 days, the function would be taken away. I use this function every single work day so this is confusing)." If you’re drowning in DMs, mentions, and client check-ins, Agorapulse might be the sanity-saver your agency needs. Its biggest strength? A unified inbox that lets your team stay on top of comments, messages, reviews, and brand mentions — all from one clean dashboard. Add advanced team roles, saved replies, and reporting that ties posts to ROI, and it’s easy to see why many agencies trust it as their main social media management tool. Just know: it’s not cheap, and you’ll need to move to higher-tier plans to unlock features like bulk scheduling. Agorapulse has 4 main pricing plans and a 30-day free trial: Most customers rate Agorapulse 4-5 stars across online reviews. Customers like being able to manage all of their social media DMs in one place and the ability to track brand mentions across social platforms. One of the most common criticisms is the high price point for smaller businesses. Here's what Bianka B. has to say about using Agorapulse: “Agorapulse is an essential tool for social media management. We use it daily at Effet B and particularly appreciate its intuitive interface, comprehensive features (scheduling, moderation, reporting), and the clarity of the reports. The calendar is very well designed, the unified inbox tool saves us valuable time, and the customer service is always quick and efficient. It is a reliable platform that allows us to better collaborate as a team and optimize our social strategies. I highly recommend Agorapulse to any agency or SME looking to structure and simplify their social media management.” If your agency is focused on Instagram growth — especially for visual brands like ecom, beauty, or lifestyle — Later is one of the most polished tools out there. From grid planning and hashtag suggestions to visual drag-and-drop scheduling and link-in-bio tools, it’s built specifically for teams that live and breathe IG content. And while it supports other platforms too (like TikTok, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Pinterest), many of its best features are Instagram-only. It’s not the most budget-friendly option, and it lacks advanced reporting and content discovery tools — but for agencies that want to nail the look and flow of their clients’ feeds, it’s hard to beat. Later offers 3 pricing plans: Later mostly receives 4-5 stars across online reviews. Users love saving hours by scheduling posts months in advance. Some users mention the price being higher than they'd like and the UI feeling a bit clunky. Here's what Fiona M. has to say about using Later: “Overall experience is 99/100 for Later. I’ve tried other scheduling programs but this is by far the best. Later is so easy to use and the visual grid is excellent - it’s also super easy to manage multiple profiles and multiple client social accounts. There are so many features from drafts to analytics to the linkin bio It’s missing LinkedIn analytics which would make it perfect and I’d love to be able to auto post stories on Instagram but otherwise all good.” Buffer is a clean, intuitive social media management tool that agencies love for one big reason: it just works. If your team values clarity, ease of use, and strong analytics, Buffer delivers. It’s especially great for agencies focused on consistent publishing and reporting — without the distractions of features you’ll never use. You won’t find content discovery or fancy visual planners here. But if you’re managing clients who value strategy, data, and smooth workflows, Buffer is a dependable, low-friction option. Unlike some of the other schedulers on this list, Buffer charges you per channel that you use. Buffer offers 3 main pricing plans: Most Buffer customers rate the software between 4-5 stars across thousands of online reviews. Most users value its scheduling, social media management, and analytics features. On the other hand, users sometimes comment that the UI is a bit funky and dislike the pricing structure being based on channels. Here's what Void D. has to say about using Buffer: "Overall my experience with buffer was really great. I ended up moving to another post scheduler due to the necessity of multiple post queues, but really miss the overall ease of use with buffer. Buffer has a very easy to use interface, and auto-scheduling and reorganizing scheduled posts is extremely easy. The workflow feels intuitive and I never had to pull out the FAQ to figure out how to do what I wanted. The lack of ability to have multiple post scheduling queues for a single social media account. One queue works fine if you only post a single type of content, but having to manually schedule or re-organize the schedule if you have multiple post types (images, video, text, etc) gets really tedious." Onlypult is one of the most underrated social media tools for agencies — especially if you need broad platform support without a bloated price tag. It’s designed primarily for Facebook and Instagram, but it actually supports over a dozen networks (including Telegram, Tumblr, VK, and even Medium). If your clients use a wide range of channels — or if you're managing international brands — Onlypult can help you cover them all. While it lacks modern content discovery and curation tools, it does offer unique extras like a built-in website builder and brand mention tracking. And with scalable pricing for teams, it’s a decent option for lean agencies. Onlypult offers 4 main pricing plans: Onlypult has the fewest online reviews of any schedulers on this list, but of the reviews it has, it mostly gets 4-5 stars. Customers value Onlypult's Instagam-first approach. However, some critics complain that the platform is not as robust as other platforms. Here's what one verified user has to say about using Onlypult: "Using Onlypult, I have managed Social channels easily. For me, it is key the Ig preview and the AI help for the captions I do not like the fact that the pages/profiles of the same client are not really synchronised, so you have to deal them one by one. Also the calendar view is by social media channel, I would prefer a complete view by date. It is a platform for planning, so you can prepare/plan posts in advance." The right social media management tool can save you hours, help you scale clients, and actually make posting fun again. Most of the tools on this list offer a free trial — but if you want a budget-friendly option built specifically for agencies, Post Planner is a great place to start. It’s affordable, easy to use, and packed with time-saving features like content buckets, AI writing tools, and bulk scheduling. Sign up for a free Post Planner account and see how much smoother your agency’s social media can run. No Comments © 2011-2025 Post Planner

Title: Big Tech's AI Spending—and Borrowing—Will Be Even Higher Next Year, Says Citi
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/big-tech-s-ai-spending-and-borrowing-will-be-even-higher-next-year-says-citi-11821812

After a series of big cloud computing deals this month, Citigroup analysts now expect AI spending to exceed their already eye-watering forecast. Citi analysts on Tuesday estimated that hyperscalers—including Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Oracle (ORCL), and CoreWeave (CRWV)—will spend $490 billion on infrastructure and other capital goods next year, up from a prior estimate of $420 billion. Citi’s forecasts are slightly above the Wall Street consensus. The AI infrastructure boom has been a major force behind U.S. stock market gains and economic growth in recent years. If tech companies rely on debt to fund their massive AI investments, they could expose the AI buildout—and the broader economy—to greater risk. The analysts pointed to an onslaught of announced partnerships, investments, and products in recent weeks as evidence of strong AI demand. They said their recent conversations with CIOs and CTOs at a range of companies “reflect a similar increase in urgency around adoption at the enterprise level.” Citi expects AI infrastructure providers like Nvidia (NVDA) to benefit from higher spending. As such, the firm’s analysts raised their price target on Nvidia shares to $210 from $200 on Tuesday. The hyperscalers are among the world’s largest, most profitable companies, a fact that has enabled them to increase their infrastructure spending exponentially over the past few years. But not even hugely profitable tech giants can undertake this level of investment on their own. “It is notable that we have gone from the cash flow funded stage of this investment cycle to the debt funded stage, with the incremental risks that come with it,” Citi’s analysts wrote. Oracle last week sold $18 billion of bonds in the second-largest U.S. debt deal this year, according to a Bloomberg report. Oracle, which has spent more than it's made in each of the last two quarters, is expected to use the debt to increase its cloud capacity so it can deliver on a five-year, $300 billion deal with OpenAI. Adding that much capacity will be expensive. Citi sees Oracle’s capital expenditures ballooning to $58 billion in fiscal year 2027, nearly three times what it spent in the fiscal year that ended in May. OpenAI, another company that will need to spend a lot to support its ambitions, took a different approach to raising money. Last week, the company struck a deal with Nvidia to deploy 10 GW of Nvidia systems over the next five years in exchange for an incremental $100 billion equity investment. OpenAI is reportedly discussing leasing—not buying—the chips from Nvidia, a novel arrangement that could cut its hardware costs by 10 to 15%, according to The Information. The deal raised eyebrows on Wall Street, where some analysts and investors expressed concern about the “circularity” and concentration of the AI ecosystem. Some skeptics likened it to a bailout, with Nvidia stepping in as an investor of last resort to support a cash-starved OpenAI. It has also inspired comparisons to the Dotcom Bubble, when telecom equipment providers lent to and invested in their own customers, fueling speculative fervor. But analysts see important differences between the 1990s and today. “The critical distinction, in our view, is the ‘off-ramp’ created by growing external demand for AI services driven by enterprise adoption,” write Citi analysts. Companies like OpenAI and Meta (META), they say, are rolling out AI-driven applications and services with clear monetization prospects. And the rate of AI’s technological progress, they argue, is quickly expanding the scope of potential applications.

Title: Wall Street shrugs off shutdown threat as S&P 500 heads for fifth straight winning month

U.S. stocks coasted to the finish of their latest winning month. The S&P 500 rose 0.4% Tuesday to close out its fifth straight winning month after setting a record last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.3%. The quiet trading came as a potential shutdown of the U.S. government loomed. Past shutdowns have had limited impact on the economy and stock market, and many investors expect something similar this time around. Treasury yields wavered but ultimately held relatively steady following mixed reports on the U.S. economy. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. U.S. stocks are coasting toward the finish of Wall Street’s latest winning month on Tuesday, as financial markets give a collective yawn for the potential shutdown of the U.S. federal government that’s looming. The S&P 500 edged up by 0.1% and is on track for a fifth straight winning month after setting a record last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 18 points, or less than 0.1%, with an hour remaining in trading, and the Nasdaq composite was virtually unchanged. The quiet trading came as a midnight deadline approached, when the U.S. government looks likely to shut down because of Washington’s latest political impasse. That’s because history has shown that past shutdowns have had limited impact on the economy and stock market, and many economists and professional investors expect something similar this time around. The S&P 500 has climbed an average of 4.4% during past shutdowns and is positive over the last five, according to Monica Guerra, head of U.S. policy at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. The broad stock market has been on a nearly relentless run since hitting a low in April on expectations that President Donald Trump’s tariffs won’t derail global trade and that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates several times to boost the slowing job market. Treasury yields wavered in the bond market but ultimately held relatively steady following a couple mixed reports on the U.S. economy. One said consumers are feeling less confident than economists expected, with many respondents in the Conference Board’s survey pointing to the job market and to inflation that has remained higher than anyone would like. A second report suggested the job market may be remaining in its “low-hire, low-fire” state. U.S. employers were advertising roughly the same number of job openings at the end of August as the month before. The hope on Wall Street had been for a number that’s neither too high nor too low, one balanced enough to keep the Fed on track to continue cutting interest rates. The Fed just delivered its first cut of the year, and officials have penciled in more through the end of next year to give the job market a boost. Too-strong data on jobs could make the Fed less willing to cut rates, which would back up criticism that the U.S. stock market has become too expensive after prices ran so high. Too-weak numbers, meanwhile, could signal a coming recession, which would also hurt stock prices. When Wall Street will get upcoming data reports on the job market and inflation is uncertain, though. A shutdown of the federal government would cause delays for several important reports, including Friday’s on how many jobs U.S. employers created and destroyed in September. That could make Wall Street more twitchy when investors are already nervous about the state of the economy and what that means for the potential for cuts to rates. The Department of Labor has already said that the Bureau of Labor Statistics will completely cease operations if there’s a lapse. On Wall Street, Spotify Technology sank 5.4% after the Stockholm-based streaming giant said its founder, Daniel Ek, is stepping down as CEO to become the executive chairman. Two of his lieutenants will replace him as co-CEOs: Chief Product and Technology Officer Gustav Söderström and Chief Business Officer Alex Norström. Oil-related companies weighed on the market after the price of crude fell again as traders see too much oil washing around the world. Schlumberger fell 2.7%, and Halliburton dropped 2%. On the winning side of Wall Street was CoreWeave, which jumped 11.8%. It said Meta Platforms will pay up to $14.2 billion for a new order for cloud computing power made under its existing service agreement, with the potential for more. Lamb Weston climbed 4% after the supplier of frozen French fries and other potato products reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. In stock markets abroad, indexes ticked higher in Europe following a mixed finish in Asia. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury held steady at 4.15%, where it was late Monday. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.
