ByGuruFocus ByGuruFocus Contributor. By Nabeel Bukhari Broadcom Inc is a semiconductor giant, making the chips and infrastructure that power the most advanced computing systems in the world. Broadcom’s technology is everywhere, whether it’s the hyperscalers such as Amazon and Alphabet training large AI models or enterprises integrating AI-driven applications. But the more interesting thing is that the company just delivered another blowout quarter, with revenue exploding and AI-related sales skyrocketing. It's also very profitable, with a very high expected adjusted EBITDA margin, which is rare in semiconductors. Despite a premium valuation, Broadcom's future still looks bright with strong cash flow and noteworthy partnerships. Also, as the stock has dropped 16% YTD, this dip might be a buying opportunity before the next leg up and the stock could continue to surprise investors. The question is, how high can Broadcom go? Let's dive in to find out. Broadcom crushed estimates in its first quarter of fiscal 2025. The AI hardware leader beat on earnings-per-share (EPS) of $1.60 by 9 cents and significantly surpassed revenue expectations of $14.92 billion, $330 million ahead of estimates. The 25% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth of the company is a result of continued heavy investment by data centers and hyperscalers upgrading their AI infrastructure. Infrastructure software revenue clocked in at 47% and Broadcom's semiconductor solutions revenue grew 11% year over year on broad-based demand across its portfolio. Now, let’s talk a bit about AI spending, which is only accelerating, placing Broadcom to ride a long-term tailwind. Tech giants like Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Apple are shelling out in order to stay at the forefront of the AI race, and Broadcom is benefiting from their activities. The company's Q1 AI-related revenue increased 77% compared to the previous year to $4.1 billion, which is clear evidence of the growing demand for its AI-optimized chips and connectivity solutions. And this is only the beginning. The data center and AI-related hardware and software market are seen as expanding at a ridiculous 40-55% annually toward $1.4 trillion by 2027. As more and more industries increasingly adopt AI usage in their business processes, the demand for AI infrastructure will quickly increase and Broadcom is well set to take a large portion of it. Strong free cash flow momentum: Beyond top-line growth, Broadcom's free cash flow (FCF) increased even faster than revenue, which is evidence of strong cash generation and operational efficiency by Broadcom. The company generated a FCF of $6.0 billion, up 28% YOY. This figure outpaced revenue growth by three percentage points. It also meant a 40% FCF margin, up 1 percentage point quarter-over-quarter and validating Broadcom's ability to reinvest in growth, pay down debt and return capital to shareholders. Since Broadcom is executing flawlessly and AI demand is growing rapidly, the company should continue to deliver brilliant results in the quarters ahead. Q2 FY25 looks just as strong as well. Revenue is expected to come in around $14.9 billion, which is a strong 19% YOY increase, a symbol that the demand for its products is not slowing down anytime soon. And with no surprise, the biggest driver is AI. Broadcom's AI semiconductor revenue alone is expected to be around $4.4 billion in the quarter due to hyperscalers spending on AI XPUs and connectivity solutions. This is a huge tailwind, and it resonates with the importance of Broadcom's tech in driving the AI revolution. Finally, their profitability with an expected 66% adjusted EBITDA margin is more impressive. That's rare in semis, but such a mix of high-value AI chips and infrastructure software of Broadcom maintains fat margins. Broadcom is pushing the semiconductor innovation boundaries as hyperscalers step it up on AI investments. Its tech has become extremely essential, and the company's Q2 expectations in AI semiconductor revenue are a testament to that. The company is pouring resources into R&D to keep ahead, putting focus on cutting-edge AI XPUs and networking. It is developing a 10,000 teraflops XPU with 2nm 3.5D packaging and scaling AI clusters to 1 million XPUs on Ethernet. On the networking side, it has doubled RAID capacity and is prepping 1.6T bandwidth switches for sampling. These advancements in AI will be game-changers in the AI accelerator industry. Strategically, Broadcom is winning big. Just recently, two more hyperscalers tapped Broadcom for AI XPUs in order to draw on its stature as a key enabler of AI infrastructure. Now the company is making Alphabet’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), Microsoft's Maia, Amazon's Trainium and Inferentia, Meta Platforms' MTIA, and ByteDance's AI ASIC chips, essentially providing the custom silicon for the biggest names in AI. Broadcom's balanced model of high-margin software and AI-driven hardware is shown by this deep integration across most of the major cloud and AI players and the VMware-driven enterprise software growth. If Broadcom continues at this speed, the company might cement itself as one of the most powerful forces in AI infrastructure. Broadcom has done an excellent job of maintaining an earnings consistency track record, having either met or beaten EPS estimates in every quarter over the past few years. Such outperformance speaks to the company's business model's enduring power as well as the ability to drive continued growth. Broadcom Inc Price Chart Investors have taken notice as Broadcom's stock price has surged 53% over the past year and a whopping 931% over the past half-decade. This performance is not simply luck but instead reflects the company's strategic positioning in AI-driven semiconductors and enterprise software. Broadcom Inc EPS Quarterly Estimate Chart Looking ahead, Broadcom is set to post robust earnings and revenue growth. The EPS for FY2025 and FY2026 are projected to increase substantially YOY, at $6.62 and $7.86 respectively. Nonetheless, seeing how Broadcom has a track record of exceeding estimates, it can do the same in the future as well. If Broadcom delivers results in line or above the past quarters by the same margin of say 3-5%, then its EPS for FY2025 can touch $6.80-$6.95 and for FY2026 can cross $8.00. This means that the potential of this outperformance will make its valuation even more attractive. Premium price? Not really: Broadcom's forward P/E at 28.7 may seem elevated at first glance compared to traditional value stocks. However, as stated above, premium valuations are justified if a company generates superior growth. Broadcom's earnings trajectory supports its multiple in its case. A deeper look at Broadcom's Price-to-Earnings Growth (PEG) ratio provides further evidence that it is relatively cheap. The stock is trading at a PEG ratio of 1.31, based on a forward P/E of 28.7 times and a matching EPS growth rate. Broadcom's PEG indicates that the company is attractively priced in view of its strong earnings trajectory and is notably 18.75% lower than the sector median of 1.67. The bottom line is that despite the premium valuation of Broadcom, the stock is still relatively cheap when one takes into consideration its growth rate. With a solid track record of consistent estimate beats and strong EPS and revenue growth, Broadcom has a lot of room to run. In FY2025, EPS is forecasted to be $6.62, rising to $7.86 in FY2026 and higher. This implies a short-term price target of about $205 to $210 (based on FY2025 estimates) given this company's forward P/E of approximately 28.7 times. In the long-term, EPS is expected to rise to $9.12 in FY2027 and $12.74 in FY2028. If it happens, a conservative P/E multiple of about 21 times implies the stock should trade near $280-$290 in 3-4 years. Broadcom Inc EPS Quarterly Estimate Trends Bullish case scenario: If Broadcom exceeds estimates, due to AI demand, networking expansion, and software growth, EPS would grow faster than expected. If EPS reaches $7.00 in FY2025 and $8.25 in FY2026, and the market rewards Broadcom with a higher multiple of 32 times P/E, the stock could trade above $235 in the short-term. And if EPS hits $10.50 by FY2027 and $14.00 by FY2028, a 23-25 times P/E multiple would take the stock to $350-$375 within the next few years in the long-term bullish case. Broadcom Price Target Scenarios Broadcom insiders have been selling a notable amount of stock over the past year, which naturally piques some eyebrows. CEO Hock Tan sold $26 million worth of shares at $173 each, one of the biggest sales. It seems concerning, but as it was only 10% of his holdings, it's not necessarily a red flag. In addition, insider selling dropped in the past three months and no insider sales occurred in the past month, perhaps implying that the company's executives hang on to their shares after Broadcom's latest earnings release. Furthermore, Broadcom's 1.3% insider ownership worth $14 billion is still a good thing. It is not a huge stake, but it is a statement that executives and important decision-makers have an interest in the company's long-term success. Institutional investors are stepping in: Although there have not been any insider buys recently, institutional investors are increasingly confident in Broadcom's long-term potential, even as insiders are cashing out. Institutional buying tends to outweigh insider selling, as these funds are taking a long-term, research-backed approach. Broadcom Inc Number of Guru Trades While some gurus are taking profits or rebalancing, trades demonstrate a steady accumulation trend, which implies that large funds see Broadcom as a stock they want to hold or add to at current levels. One of the standout among them is Ken Fisher, the founder of Fisher Investments who currently has 23.9 million shares. Fisher uses tech stocks heavily in bull markets, as they are supposed to lead the rally. According to him, Broadcom is a key pillar of market strength, and his large stake in his firm reflects his confidence that the stock will continue to be this way. Balancing debt repayment with growth potential: Broadcom's insider selling could be deemed a strategic move of offloading shares at premium valuations to repay debt. Broadcom took on a big bet on debt with its $69 billion VMware acquisition and has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.14 which is very low, so it makes sense to lower leverage. That said, the company has enough free cash flow to reinvest in innovation while improving its balance sheet. If Broadcom continues to grow at such a pace, the dilution from insider sales may be minimal and the company may be able to grow past any concerns, making these insider sales a natural part of its financial strategy, not a reason to worry. Broadcom's growth trajectory is still very compelling, but a few risks may counter its bullish outlook. The biggest risk is Broadcom relying on Apple. Beginning with the iPhone 17 in 2H25, Apple's transition to in-house Wi-Fi chips could have a big impact on Broadcom's sales. This revenue stream may decline, provided Apple fully phases out Broadcom's chips over the next three years. Another concern is valuation risk. If growth fails or doesn't merit these superior multiples, Broadcom might face downward pressure. Lastly, profitability concerns remain. While sales are growing, gross margin expansion must be sustained. Investors would shift out of Broadcom if it grows revenue but cannot keep the margin momentum. Broadcom is in a perfect situation to take advantage of the AI boom and enjoy solid top and bottom-line growth. The long-term risk from Apple's move toward in-house chips is a big one, but the stock's AI momentum is more than enough to make up for lost revenue. Valuation too continues to be a point of debate, but the history of beating estimates and AI demand surging make its premium multiple justified. Insider selling might also make investors worry, which is justified and should be kept an eye on, but investors should not finalize their bet on a stock based on it. There are many other watch factors, for instance, maintaining profitability. Broadcom can stay ahead as long as it continues to expand margins with revenue growth. For now, the stock looks well positioned for long-term upside.

An AI bubble threatens Silicon Valley, and all of us. by Bryan McMahon March 25, 2025 5:30 AM This article appears in the April 2025 issue of The American Prospect magazine. Subscribe here. The week of Donald Trump’s inauguration, Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, stood tall next to the president as he made a dramatic announcement: the launch of Project Stargate, a $500 billion supercluster in the rolling plains of Texas that would run OpenAI’s massive artificial-intelligence models. Befitting its name, Stargate would dwarf most megaprojects in human history. Even the $100 billion that Altman promised would be deployed “immediately” would be much more expensive than the Manhattan Project ($30 billion in current dollars) and the COVID vaccine’s Operation Warp Speed ($18 billion), rivaling the multiyear construction of the Interstate Highway System ($114 billion). OpenAI would have all the computing infrastructure it needed to complete its ultimate goal of building humanity’s last invention: artificial general intelligence (AGI). Art for this story was created with Midjourney 6.1, an AI image generator. But the reaction to Stargate was muted as Silicon Valley had turned its attention west. A new generative AI model called DeepSeek R1, released by the Chinese hedge fund High-Flyer, sent a threatening tremor through the balance sheets and investment portfolios of the tech industry. DeepSeek’s latest version, allegedly trained for just $6 million (though this has been contested), matched the performance of OpenAI’s flagship reasoning model o1 at 95 percent lower cost. R1 even learned o1 reasoning techniques, OpenAI’s much-hyped “secret sauce” to allow it to maintain a wide technical lead over other models. Best of all, R1 is open-source down to the model weights, so anyone can download and modify the details of the model themselves for free. It’s an existential threat to OpenAI’s business model, which depends on using its technical lead to sell the most expensive subscriptions in the industry. It also threatens to pop a speculative bubble around generative AI inflated by the Silicon Valley hype machine, with hundreds of billions at stake. Venture capital (VC) funds, drunk on a decade of “growth at all costs,” have poured about $200 billion into generative AI. Making matters worse, the stock market’s bull run is deeply dependent on the growth of the Big Tech companies fueling the AI bubble. In 2023, 71 percent of the total gains in the S&P 500 were attributable to the “Magnificent Seven”—Apple, Nvidia, Tesla, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft—all of which are among the biggest spenders on AI. Just four—Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta—combined for $246 billion of capital expenditure in 2024 to support the AI build-out. Goldman Sachs expects Big Tech to spend over $1 trillion on chips and data centers to power AI over the next five years. Yet OpenAI, the current market leader, expects to lose $5 billion this year, and its annual losses to swell to $11 billion by 2026. If the AI bubble bursts, it not only threatens to wipe out VC firms in the Valley but also blow a gaping hole in the public markets and cause an economy-wide meltdown. The basic problem facing Silicon Valley today is, ironically, one of growth. There are no more digital frontiers to conquer. The young, pioneering upstarts—Facebook, Google, Amazon—that struck out toward the digital wilderness are now the monopolists, constraining growth with onerous rentier fees they can charge because of their market-making size. The software industry’s spectacular returns from the launch of the internet in the ’90s to the end of the 2010s would never come back, but venture capitalists still chased the chance to invest in the next Facebook or Google. This has led to what AI critic Ed Zitron calls the “rot economy,” in which VCs overhype a series of digital technologies—the blockchain, then cryptocurrencies, then NFTs, and then the metaverse—promising the limitless growth of the early internet companies. According to Zitron, each of these innovations failed to either transform existing industries or become sustainable industries themselves, because the business case at the heart of these technologies was rotten, pushed forward by wasteful, bloated venture investments still selling an endless digital frontier of growth that no longer existed. Enter AGI, the proposed creation of an AI with an intelligence that dwarfs any single person’s and possibly the collective intelligence of humanity. Once AGI is built, we can easily solve many of the toughest challenges facing humanity: climate change, cancer, new net-zero energy sources. And no company has pushed the coming of AGI more than OpenAI, which has ridden the hype to incredible heights since its release of generative chatbot ChatGPT. Last year, OpenAI completed a blockbuster funding round, raising $6.6 billion at a valuation of $157 billion, making it the third most valuable startup in the world at the time after SpaceX and ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company. OpenAI, which released ChatGPT in November 2022, now sees 250 million weekly active users and about 11 million paying subscribers for its AI tools. The startup’s monthly revenue hit $300 million in August, up more than 1,700 percent since the start of 2023, and it expects to clear $3.7 billion for the year. By all accounts, this is another world-changing startup on a meteoric rise. Yet take a deeper look at OpenAI’s financial situation and expected future growth, and cracks begin to show. “Big Tech Incinerates Its Fortune,” in the style of Vincent van Gogh To start, OpenAI is burning money at an impressive but unsustainable pace. The latest funding round is its third in the last two years, atypical for a startup, that also included a $4 billion revolving line of credit—a loan on tap, essentially—on top of the $6.6 billion of equity, revealing an insatiable need for investor cash to survive. Despite $3.7 billion in sales this year, OpenAI expects to lose $5 billion due to the stratospheric costs of building and running generative AI models, which includes $4 billion in cloud computing to run their AI models, $3 billion in computing to train the next generation of models, and $1.5 billion for its staff. According to its own numbers, OpenAI loses $2 for every $1 it makes, a red flag for the sustainability of any business. Worse, these costs are expected to increase as ChatGPT gains users and OpenAI seeks to upgrade its foundation model from GPT-4 to GPT-5 sometime in the next six months. Financial documents reviewed by The Information confirm this trajectory as the startup predicts its annual losses will hit $14 billion by 2026. Further, OpenAI sees $100 billion in annual revenue—a number that would rival Nestlé and Target’s returns—as the point at which it will finally break even. For comparison, Google’s parent company, Alphabet, only cleared $100 billion in sales in 2021, 23 years after its founding, yet boasted a portfolio of money-making products, including Google Search, the Android operating system, Gmail, and cloud computing. OpenAI is deeply dependent on hypothetical breakthroughs from future models that unlock more capabilities to boost its subscription price and grow its user base. Its GPT-5 class models and beyond must pull godlike capacities for AI out of the algorithmic ether to create a user base of hundreds of millions of paid subscribers. Yet, with the release of the open-source DeepSeek R1 model earlier this month, OpenAI has no moat for its increasingly expensive products. The R1 matched its performance across math, chemistry, and coding tasks, independently learned OpenAI’s reasoning techniques, and can be downloaded, modified, and deployed for free. Why would people continue to pay $20, let alone the $200 tier OpenAI reserves for its latest, greatest models, rather than use something that can deliver the same performance at a 95 percent lower price? Venture capital funds, drunk on a decade of “growth at all costs,” have poured about $200 billion into generative AI. Wall Street asked itself the same question after the release of DeepSeek R1 and panicked, wiping more than 15 percent ($600 billion) off Nvidia’s stock price, the largest single-day loss for a company ever. And that’s not the only bad sign Altman received about OpenAI’s future. OpenAI is in talks again to raise more money (less than a year after raising $10 billion) at a proposed $340 billion valuation. In most cases, a startup doubling its valuation would be great news. But for OpenAI, the money may make things worse. It signals a desperate need for cash and puts more pressure on a company that today loses $2 for every dollar it makes. As Zitron pointed out, at $340 billion, few companies have the liquidity to acquire OpenAI, and public investors expect strong returns and profitability to justify an IPO anywhere near that price. Plus, the latest round of funding is being led by Masayoshi Son, a billionaire investor known more for losing money than making it. Given Son’s Vision Fund’s disastrous investing record, Zitron said, it’s as bearish a signal as you could find. Hanging over all this for OpenAI is the fact that Microsoft’s investments in the company, which run north of $10 billion, are not standard equity investments but “profit participation units” that will convert to debt in a year and a half. It’s not just OpenAI that’s burning through billions. Silicon Valley has hyped AI as the next internet or iPhone, and has invested like it cannot afford to miss out on the next big tech revolution. In 2021, with the last gasp of zero-interest-rate loans paired with trillions in COVID relief spending, venture capitalists poured a record $78.5 billion into the AI space. And, despite a broader slowdown in venture activity, the second quarter of 2024 set the record for quarterly venture investing in AI at $23.3 billion. In fact, 33 percent of VC portfolios are committed to AI, another worrying sign of concentration. … in the style of Hokusai Even so, Big Tech companies are the biggest spenders on AI. While VCs dropped approximately $200 billion into AI between 2021 and 2024, Big Tech is on pace to surpass that amount this year alone. According to Goldman Sachs research, cloud computing giants are expected to plow over $1 trillion over the next five years into graphics processing units (GPUs) and to build data centers to power generative AI. AI is an expensive technology like few before it. All those racks of GPUs and supercluster data centers need power, and the power industry is also embarking on a once-in-a-generation investment spree to keep up. The scale of expected data centers to power generative AI is difficult to wrap your head around. Oracle recently announced plans to build a gigawatt-scale data center just for AI, powered by a trio of nuclear reactors, while OpenAI pitched the White House on the necessity of five-gigawatt data centers, which would be enough power for about three million homes consumed by a single AI data center. A recent report from McKinsey expects the electricity going to fuel AI data centers will triple from 3 to 4 percent of the country’s electricity to 11 to 12 percent by 2030. The power industry typically grows 2 to 3 percent a year, far too little to meet the predicted jump in demand. McKinsey estimates that power utilities would have to spend $500 billion on top of their planned capital expenditure to keep up with AI needs. If true, this presents a serious bottleneck for not just OpenAI but the expected growth of the AI industry. Between VCs, Big Tech, and power utilities, the bill for generative AI comes out to close to $2 trillion in spending over the next five years alone. Adding all this up, some are starting to question the economic fundamentals of generative AI. Jim Covello, head of global equity research at Goldman Sachs, doubts the technology can recoup what’s been invested as, unlike the internet, it fails to solve complex business problems at a lower cost than what’s available today. Plus, he argues, the most expensive inputs for generative AI, GPUs and energy, are unlikely to decline meaningfully for the tech industry over time, given how far demand outstrips supply for both. While AI-fueled coding could definitely boost productivity, it’s hard to see how it could become a multitrillion-dollar industry. Surveys confirm that for many workers, AI tools like ChatGPT reduce their productivity by increasing the volume of content and steps needed to complete a given task, and by frequently introducing errors that have to be checked and corrected. A study by Uplevel Data Labs tracked 800 software engineers using Copilot on GitHub and found no measurable increase in coding productivity, despite this exact use case being the one pointed to the most by AI companies. And even productivity gains may come at a cost: Microsoft researchers concluded that workers became more productive using generative AI tools but their critical thinking skills declined, presumably because they were offloading the thinking to AI. Looking past the hype, the business case for generative AI two years after the stunning success of ChatGPT appears weaker by the day. … in the style of Jacob Lawrence Even worse, as AI expert Gary Marcus pointed out, DeepSeek’s R1 model spells serious trouble for OpenAI and the cloud giants. The only way OpenAI could hope to recoup the billions it was spending on GPUs to train bigger and bigger models was to maintain a large enough technical lead over other AI companies to justify charging up to $200 for paid subscriptions to its models. That lead just vaporized and was given to the entire industry for free. In response, Altman has already twice cut the prices of his subscriptions in an effort to stay competitive. But without millions of paid subscriptions, it’s difficult to see the pathway to profitability for a company that loses $2 for every $1 it brings in and expects costs to continue to grow approximately tenfold in five years. OpenAI has set $100 billion as its break-even point, which would require it to increase its revenue by a factor of 25 in just five years, an incredible feat of scale that its current business model does not justify. OpenAI is, however, the perfect kind of growth-at-all-costs story investors need to think still exists—capable of not only achieving Meta- or Amazon-like growth again, but becoming an indispensable part of growth and innovation in every industry in the future, too. No industry could escape, and software would close its jaws around the world, finally, as Marc Andreessen predicted in 2011. For his part, Gary Marcus has taken to calling OpenAI the WeWork of AI—WeWork, of course, is the poster boy for wasteful, nearly fraudulent, growth-at-all-costs investing that led to a spectacular downfall. Marcus is so confident current approaches cannot take us to the promised land of AGI that he bet Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei $100,000 that AGI would not be achieved by the end of 2027. Without AGI, the valuations of leading AI startups like OpenAI ($340 billion) and Anthropic ($61.5 billion) stop making sense. If GPUs are no longer the most capital-efficient or effective way to build better AI models, then the expected AI computing “supercycle” that the hundreds of billions in capital expenditure is premised on never arrives. Instead, the underlying asset bubble of a multitrillion-dollar bet on GPUs as the necessary component to an internet-like era of growth vanishes into thin air. For many workers, AI tools reduce their productivity by increasing the volume of steps needed to complete a given task. OpenAI’s incredible burn rate, the trillions in capital expenditure by cloud giants and utilities to build out the infrastructure necessary to support AI, the supply bottlenecks ahead from the power and semiconductor industries, and the questionable economic gains from these tools all point to a generative AI bubble. Should the bubble burst, startups and venture funds alike face possible extinction, and a big enough drop from the Magnificent Seven could spark skittish markets to panic, leading to wider economic contagion, given how dependent on the growth of the top technology companies the public markets have become. In 2024, the Magnificent Seven were responsible for the lion’s share of the growth of the S&P 500, with the returns of the other 493 companies flat. When Nvidia hit its peak valuation of $3 trillion over the summer, just five of the seven—Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Amazon—accounted for 29 percent of the total index’s value, surpassing the concentration of the five top technology companies just before the dot-com crash. Nvidia has been on an incredible bull run over the last five years, its shares gaining a dizzying 4,300 percent, reminiscent of how network equipment maker Cisco grew about 4,500 percent in the five years leading up to its peak just before the dot-com crash in 2000. Nvidia and the other Magnificent Seven members are in a codependent relationship when it comes to AI hype. They are Nvidia’s biggest customers, feeding the bull run by pushing demand for GPUs beyond even what chipmaker TSMC can supply. At the moment, Nvidia can pass those prices on to their customers, the only clusters big enough for AI computing. But should demand for AI fall, all seven will tumble with it. … in the style of Roy Lichtenstein For the tech industry, DeepSeek is a threat to its incredible bull run because it proved three things. First, frontier AI models could be trained much more cheaply and efficiently than the current Silicon Valley approach of building massive models requiring hundreds of thousands of GPUs to train. From a capital perspective, the U.S. strategy is wasteful, relying on at least ten times the investment to make similar model progress. Second, DeepSeek showed you could train a state-of-the-art model without the latest GPUs, calling into question the current demand for the latest GPUs that is so hot customers have been facing delays of six months to a year to get their hands on them. Finally, the high valuations of leading AI startups depend on a technical lead in their models to charge prices anywhere near what they need to recoup their computing costs, but that technical lead, enabled by a combination of closed-source models, billions in capital expenditure, and export controls blocking Chinese companies like DeepSeek from accessing the latest GPUs, is gone. Should demand for GPUs fall or even not hit the exponential increases the billions invested are betting on, the bubble will pop. Given the stock market’s dependence on tech companies for growth, the trigger may not come from the AI industry itself, but any pullback in spending will crater the current trajectory of the AI industry. Many potential triggers abound: a crypto crash; President Trump’s trade wars with Canada, Mexico, and China; the stated goal to cut more than $1 trillion of government spending by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency; or a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, where nearly 70 percent of the world’s advanced computer chips are manufactured. You can tell Wall Street is worried about a bubble, because Nvidia is hit the hardest by any bearish AI news, and even when the market panic has nothing to do with the tech industry, like when the Japan currency trade happened last summer, the Magnificent Seven suffer punishing losses. The AI bubble wobbles more precariously by the day. Some bubbles, like that of the dot-com crash, end up being positive in the long run, despite the short-term economic pain of it bursting. But some, like the 2008 housing bubble, leave permanent scars on the economy and can knock an entire industry off its growth trajectory for years. To date, the U.S. housing industry has not recovered to pre-2008 growth trend lines, a major contributor to the housing crisis gripping the U.S. That is the fire that the tech industry is playing with today. This is not the Silicon Valley of lore. Venture investors, for all their tech manifestos celebrating “little tech” and entrepreneurship, have come to resemble more traditional financial firms, raising money from pension funds, hedge funds, and sovereign wealth funds. Silicon Valley has gone corporate and managerial; even private equity invests in the Valley today. The fusion of venture capital and Wall Street threatens to bring the unbridled speculation of unregulated finance and the breathless tech industry hype together in a single, massive bubble. Inimical to the old ethos of the Valley and emblematic of a bloated, rotten investing strategy, in Silicon Valley now the money chases founders rather than founders chasing money. Maybe, after the fallout of the AI bubble is felt and the sun sets on Silicon Valley for a bit, the tech world can do a hard reset and return to its more innovative days again.

In this post, we’ll provide a glossary of terms you might encounter as you build a website. We recommend bookmarking this page for easy reference—like a pocket dictionary you can return to whenever you encounter an unfamiliar term. We’ll focus on WordPress websites throughout, but most of the principles and definitions apply to websites built on any platform. Every website requires a few key technical components. Understanding what each does can help you choose the right location for your site and evaluate different providers. Your site must be stored on physical servers through a website host. Hosting is essentially your site’s place of residence on the internet. Managed hosting (like the hosting plans we have on WordPress.com!) is often an ideal choice for website owners because they take on an active role in running your website. In the case of WordPress.com, we take care of your server setup and the day-to-day management of your website, including security, uptime, and software updates, all for one flat price. A domain is a website’s address, like mygroovywebsite.com. Like physical addresses, every website must have a unique domain name. Domain prices vary depending on the web extension (like .com, .net, .org) and which domain provider you choose, and you can use a domain lookup tool to see what domains are currently available. WordPress.com offers affordable domains with over 350 different domain extensions and averaging just $13/year! Similar to domains, URLs are the specific page addresses for your web pages. URLs are a version of your domain with added information that tells your computer which page to load. So if a website’s homepage is mygroovywebsite.com, subpages have additional path information, like mygroovywebsite.com/about, which would load the website’s about page. Permalinks are permanent URLs that point to a specific piece of content (you can update your default permalink structure on a WordPress site with just a few clicks), while slugs are part of the URL that identifies a specific page (like “about” in our example above). A content delivery network, or CDN, hosts your website on a system of distributed servers instead of one individual server. By utilizing location-specific servers, a CDN improves site speed by delivering content from a server that’s geographically closer to your visitors. Multiple servers also create redundancy, ensuring your site works even when you have a lot of visitors or if a server goes down. All WordPress.com plans have a CDN, powered by 28+ data centers across 6 continents, that puts your content as close to your visitors as possible. An XML sitemap is a list of all of the crawlable URLs on your website so that search engines (like Google) can index and show them in search results. A sitemap helps search engines better understand your site’s structure and how your content is related. A CMS is a tool that helps you build and manage a website without needing to code it from scratch. It provides a user-friendly interface to make it easy to build pages, write posts, and share other content. What is the most popular CMS in the world? WordPress! “Code” is a computer-readable direction written in programming languages. Even if you use a CMS like WordPress to build your site, there’s still a bunch of code running behind the scenes to make everything work and run smoothly. There are many programming languages, but some that you’ll most commonly see when working with WordPress are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) defines the content structure of your website. Think of this as a computer-readable version of your website that includes all the page’s core content, including titles, text, lists, buttons, and images. HTML uses “tags” to define each of these building blocks of your website, like <H1> for top-level headings and <p> for paragraphs. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) defines the style of your website. It is a design reference glossary for the browser, indicating what fonts, colors, sizes, and other elements to use when displaying your website. The cool thing about CSS is that your site updates automatically everywhere when you change a style in your glossary. For example, if you have an <H1> primary header tag in your HTML, the computer will look to the CSS to see what <H1> headers should look like. The CSS might define an <H1> as Arial font, bolded, and 36 pixels. Anywhere that the computer sees the <H1> on your website, it will show that text in Arial font, bolded, and 36 pixels. JavaScript controls the interactive elements of your website that move or change on your otherwise static web pages. JavaScript runs on the user’s side to create animations, popups, banners, alerts, and more. For example, you might use JavaScript to alert users if they didn’t properly fill out a form or to change the screen once they submit it to show them that their response has been received. PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is similar to JavaScript in that it “makes things happen” in real-time on your website. One big difference with PHP is that it runs “server-side,” meaning it changes data or dynamically updates a page’s content before it loads for visitors. PHP is an open source programming language and the language that powers the WordPress software. Metadata helps search engines identify what kind of content is on your website. This allows search engines to know when your website is relevant to someone searching the web for specific information. A title tag is an HTML element used by both search engines and visitors to understand what your webpage is about. Usually, this is the same as the post or page’s headline or title. Meta descriptions are short paragraphs (ideally 120 to 160 characters) that offer additional information to engines about your content. These often include important keywords and phrases. These descriptions may appear in search engine results, so it’s important to write strong, clear descriptions to make your website shine. Schema markup is computer-readable information added to your site’s code to identify different types of content on your webpage. This helps search engines better understand your site’s purpose. Schema markup improves site SEO, contributing important information for search engine snippets and AI-powered search results. For example, recipe plugins provide search engines with this kind of markup, enabling them to showcase recipes in search results with extra details such as images, ingredients, and cook times. Your website’s navigation elements define how site visitors move across your website. You will likely use a variety of navigation elements across your site to meet the specific goals of each page. Your menu is the primary navigation tool for your website, linking to its high-level sections. Menu options may vary depending on your template, including primary navigation menus in your header and footer, sidebar menus from specific pages, and dropdown submenus. “Hamburger menus” are common on mobile views, where detailed headers can take up too much space. These menus are hidden inside a button instead of always being visible in the header. Links are clickable text that take the site visitor to another page. They may direct users to another page on your site (internal links) or an external website (external links). They also help search engines better understand the importance of your site pages—when a page has many relevant links that allow users to navigate to it, search engines will understand that it is a valuable page on your site. Site breadcrumbs show users the “path” they took to reach their current page. For example, on a blog, a user may go from Home > Category > Blog Post. Breadcrumbs are useful on sites with many layers of interconnected pages like stores, forums, or Wikis. Buttons are clickable visual elements that encourage users to take a specific action or navigate to a specific page. A site usually has three “levels” of buttons, with the primary buttons being the biggest and brightest, followed by secondary and tertiary buttons for less important navigation items. Buttons should be strategically placed on your pages to nudge visitors to the most important content or action, such as your storefront or blog. Sharing buttons enable site visitors to easily share content from your website on other platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, or Pinterest. They are a great way to promote your content cross-platform and build your following organically. Sharing buttons are included for free on WordPress.com with Jetpack. The website header is the content at the top of every page. This section usually includes your logo, site name, tagline, and top-level site navigation (your menu!). The footer is the bottom section of your site, visible below your content on every page. It can contain additional information such as website copyright, contact forms, newsletter subscription boxes, physical addresses, social media links, or lower-priority navigation items like your privacy policy or refund policy. Your website content is what makes your website unique. Whether you are a blogger or a virtual store, your content helps you to create a personalized presence on the web. Your website’s text or copy is anything you write or customize, from menu labels to page titles, blog posts, about pages, and more. Want to learn how to write truly excellent blog copy? Use this blueprint. High-quality and relevant images are an essential part of any website. You can use your own high-quality images, license images through a stock image company, get free unlicensed imagery from sites like Pexels, or generate images with tools like Jetpack AI. Check out our WordPress image size guide to ensure your images are optimized for the web. Videos are widely used on websites because they’re often more engaging than static images. If you have a WordPress site, you can use the YouTube block to easily embed YouTube-hosted videos on your posts or pages. You can also upload your videos directly onto your site. WordPress.com offers 4K video hosting with VideoPress on the Premium plan and above. Sandwiched between your header and footer is your main page. Regardless of the page content or layout, many pages have a few standard parts. Your headline, known in HTML lingo as the <H1>, describes what your page is about; this could be something short like “About” or more specific, like the title of your blog post. You should only ever have one <H1> on a webpage. A website tagline, similar to a brand tagline, is a short, memorable phrase that explains your site’s purpose. Site taglines are usually displayed in the site header next to or under the site title or logo, in search engine results, and in social media blocks. The body content is the meat of your webpage, located between the header and footer. It is specific to each page and includes all of its content elements, such as text, images, and videos. WordPress makes it incredibly easy to add different kinds of content to your posts or pages with its block editor. There are many different blocks that come standard with any WordPress site, allowing you to customize your content exactly how you want. Website pages can vary depending on your site’s purpose, but we recommend a few standard page types for every site. Your homepage is the first page people will visit on your site, so it’s key that it is visually appealing, explains who you are and what you do, and directs visitors to other important pages across your site. Businesses use product or service pages to explain their products and provide pricing. These pages vary in complexity, from simple text lists to full ecommerce stores. Some product and service pages are purely informational; others are interactive, allowing users to purchase products directly from the page. An about page tells your site’s story, whether you’re an individual or a business. This should cover who, what, and why—that is who you are, what you do, and why you do it. You may include your personal or company history, awards or accolades, brand values, and individual or team biographies. Your contact page is where site visitors can find information on how to reach you, whether they want to schedule a meeting, contact you via email, or visit a physical location. This can be a simple text page or include forms, maps, and scheduling tools. A 404 error page alerts visitors if they are trying to visit a web URL that won’t load because the page they’re trying to access doesn’t exist. Users may see a 404 if they mistype a URL or try to access a page that you haven’t created on your site. For example, they may try to go to example.com/about-me when your about page URL is actually example.com/about. You may want to optimize your 404 page to provide assistance to anyone who accidentally sees it with a search bar and links to helpful pages on your site. For many personal and professional websites, the blog is the heart of your site: this is where you will regularly create and post new content. Unlike standard web pages, a blog is designed for easy, ongoing publishing, engagement, and sharing. Need to start a blog? Check out our 12-step guide. A post is a piece of content on your blog. Posts can include text, photos, and videos, but they also have unique elements like status, publish date, author, tags, and categories. These elements enable better navigation, search, and sorting. Posts can be structured in many different ways, but there are a few common types of posts, including lists, how-tos, personal stories, case studies, features, interviews, product reviews, and news articles. Categories help you catalog and sort your blog posts. Categories split your content into a few high-level buckets. Categories should be broad enough to organize all of your posts but specific enough to be meaningful to your readers. Category pages serve as an archive for all content grouped together under a specific category. Similarly, tags group posts together, but they’re more specific ways to describe your content. For example, you may have a “Movies” category and “Adventure,” “Rom-Com,” “Horror,” and “Sci-Fi” tags. You can use multiple tags on a single post, but to avoid clutter and to ensure your tags are useful for finding relevant content, you should only add tags for keywords that recur frequently across your website. There are a variety of reasons people may want to reach out to you through your website. Contact information—whether it’s a public email address, physical address, or form—is an important aspect of any website. You’ll also want to ensure that you have ways for visitors to stay in the loop with what you’re up to. Whether you’re sending out a regular newsletter to your subscribers or sharing your content on social media, content sharing is a key component of a sustainable brand. Contact forms allow website owners to receive messages—like questions, service requests, or feedback—without sharing their email addresses publicly. Visitors put their contact information and requests into a contact form, and the submitted form information is securely forwarded to an email address of your choosing. There are many contact form plugins available, and the Form block is free to use for WordPress.com users with Jetpack. Newsletter signup forms allow site visitors to sign up for your newsletter. These forms have inputs for a visitor’s email address and sometimes their name, and then this information is added to your mailing list. Subscribe blocks are available out-of-the-box for sites hosted on WordPress.com. Plugins are also available for third-party newsletter providers. Social media integrations allow you to connect your blog to your social media platforms. Once these integrations are in place, you can easily pass content back and forth between your website and your social media platforms, posting directly from your blog to your social media sites or embedding your social media feeds directly on your website. An ecommerce website sells goods or services online. WooCommerce, an open source plugin, is a sister company to WordPress.com. This plugin adds key ecommerce features like product pages, shopping carts, and payment processing to your site. Checkout carts are virtual shopping carts that allow visitors to select or save products they want to buy in one place. Checkout carts enable users to keep track of their items and buy multiple products in one transaction. In order for site visitors to be able to make a payment online, you need to use a payment processing software to securely accept credit card information and finalize payments. For sites hosted on WordPress.com, you can easily collect payments through Stripe, the Paid Content block, and PayPal. WordPress websites have their own internal language for different aspects of your site. If you use WordPress as your CMS or WordPress.com for hosting, these terms will help you better understand the tool and all that’s possible with it. WordPress themes are professionally designed templates that you can install and customize. Themes make it simple to start with a base design you really love to then make your own with fonts, colors, images, text, and layouts. WordPress.com has many different themes available to suit every website’s needs and visual style, including free themes and paid third-party themes. You can also install your own third-party themes on the Business plan and above. Plugins are like apps for your website—they extend your site’s functionality and features. The WordPress plugin library offers free and paid plugins for security, SEO, marketing, forms, and more. All WordPress.com users receive free essential functionality through the Jetpack plugin, with additional Jetpack features available at higher tiers. Third-party plugins can be added to sites on the Business plan and above. Patterns are professionally designed page layouts for commonly used web pages, like about pages, photo galleries, storefronts, and contact pages. Patterns use a series of WordPress blocks to build eye-catching layouts that are easy to customize. Blocks (aptly named) are the building blocks of your WordPress website. Blocks are drag-and-drop elements that you can add to any post or page. There are around a hundred unique block types available for text, media, formatting, embedded content, theme-specific designs, forms, and more, with new block types added regularly. With WordPress.com, you get even more with Jetpack-enabled block types. Site backups save previous versions of your website so that you can easily revert your site if something breaks. This can be useful when adding or updating plugins or updating your WordPress version or theme. WordPress.com offers backups with VaultPress on the Business plan and above. Web security is essential to ensure that both your data and your visitors’ data are protected. Security features include general site security to verify your website and block phishing or spam attacks, user-based permissions, and domain privacy to protect your personal data. One benefit of using a managed hosting provider like WordPress.com is that many core security features—like automatic updates, SSL certificates, firewall protection, brute force attack prevention, downtime monitoring, and vulnerability scanning—come included, providing peace of mind for non-technical professionals. The Reader is an aggregator from WordPress.com that compiles content from Jetpack-enabled WordPress sites. Your Reader feed will show every post from the blogs you follow in one place. You can also explore new blogs or be discovered by other readers in searches that utilize categories and tags. If you’ve read through this entire post, congratulations!

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team , Contributor. META Stock Meta Platforms stock (NASDAQ:META) price surged 4% on Monday, March 24, following reports that the Trump administration might refrain from imposing sector-specific tariffs on April 2. [1] At its current price point of around $620, META stock presents an attractive investment opportunity. Our comprehensive analysis evaluates the stock through multiple critical lenses: growth potential, profitability, financial stability, and resilience during market downturns. After a detailed examination of Meta Platforms' recent operational performance and financial health, we find the company demonstrates exceptional strength across key metrics. Despite its seemingly elevated valuation, the underlying fundamentals suggest significant potential for investors. Our assessment reveals a robust financial framework that positions META as a compelling investment choice, supported by its consistent performance and strategic market positioning. The detailed evaluation considers not just surface-level metrics, but a holistic view of the company’s operational capabilities, financial robustness, and capacity to navigate challenging market conditions. This in-depth analysis underpins our confidence in META's investment potential. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, META stock looks slightly expensive compared to the broader market. Meta Platforms' Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. Meta Platforms’ profit margins are considerably higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Meta Platforms' balance sheet looks very strong. META stock has been more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during one of the two recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. In summary, Meta Platforms' performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: • Growth: Extremely Strong • Profitability: Extremely Strong • Financial Stability: Extremely Strong • Downturn Resilience: Strong • Overall: Very Strong Overall, despite the stock's elevated valuation, META remains an attractive investment opportunity, bolstered by its strong underlying performance. The company's strategic AI investments are beginning to yield tangible results, particularly in driving user engagement across its platforms. Meta’s core revenue model remains firmly anchored in advertising across its extensive app ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp. By strategically deploying artificial intelligence, the company is not only refining its ad targeting capabilities but also exploring innovative AI-powered content generation technologies. These initiatives position Meta to potentially unlock new revenue streams and enhance its competitive advantage in the rapidly evolving digital advertising landscape. The convergence of AI technology with Meta’s robust user base and established advertising infrastructure suggests promising growth potential. While it doesn’t look like there is much upside to META stock, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid- and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

March 24, 2025 14:31 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, March 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in AppLovin Corporation ("AppLovin" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: APP) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of AppLovin investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/applovin-corporation-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=137746&wire=3 APP investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in AppLovin during the relevant time frame, you have until May 5, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate. WHY LEVI & KORSINSKY: Over the past 20 years, the team at Levi & Korsinsky has secured hundreds of millions of dollars for aggrieved shareholders and built a track record of winning high-stakes cases.

To test his theory, Kendrick created a hypothetical "Mag 7B" index, a spin on the Magnificent 7 index, that replaces Tesla with Bitcoin. Normally, the Mag 7 refers to tech giants Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla. And traders who had done so in 2017 would be up 5% now, he concluded. If you add Bitcoin to the mix, its $1.7 trillion market capitalization makes it the sixth largest among the group. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has been retracing slightly after getting close to retaking $88,000. BTC has gained 3.7% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data. There's more evidence that traders are feeling less uncertain. Open interest in Bitcoin futures contracts has swelled by more than 10% in the past day, according to CoinGlass data. There are currently $57 billion worth of open Bitcoin derivatives contracts. Earlier this month, when markets were acutely feeling the effects of President Donald Trump's tariff troubles, that figure had dropped as low as $45 billion. But now that macroeconomic jitters have eased, traders seem more comfortable buying back into BTC. If BTC had been swapped into the altered Mag7 index—starting in 2017, when Bitcoin had just hit what was then an all-time high—it would have outperformed the Mag 7 by about 5%, Kendrick writes. In addition, traders who swapped Bitcoin for TSLA over the past seven years would have seen fewer price fluctuations, as well. "Perhaps more importantly than returns is Mag 7B’s lower volatility relative to Mag 7 in every year," he added. "Over the full period, average annualized volatility is almost 2% lower for Mag 7B than for Mag 7." Stock correlations have been a hotly contested topic among Bitcoin investors. In the last quarter of 2024, BTC appeared to break away from gold and equities completely and outperformed "every asset class," NYDIG noted. "Furthermore, during the period since President Trump’s inauguration on 20 January, BTC has traded like most of the Mag 7 stocks," Kendrick wrote. "If we compare price declines against [volume] levels over this period, BTC trades in a similar vol-adjusted fashion to NVDA, while TSLA trades a lot like ETH."

Title: Female executives are fighting back against alpha male CEOs

Time Published: 2025-03-24T11:47:17Z
Full Content:
Good morning. Baby boomers' hopes for a comfortable retirement could be at risk if the stock market keeps falling. Financial experts shared key strategies with BI to help protect their savings. In today's big story, female executives are fed up with alpha male CEOs acting like "billionaire boys in the sandbox." Now, they're fighting back. What's on deck Markets: Faith-based investing is having a moment. (And we don't mean confidence.) Tech: Cybersecurity researchers are role-playing with ChatGPT. Business: The rich are taking to the skies for their commutes — Ubers be damned. But first, deprogramming the bro-code. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Lately, boardrooms are brimming with the bro-ish bravado you'd expect to find in a locker room. A buff Mark Zuckerberg wants Meta to celebrate a culture of "aggression." He also likes martial arts and butchering his own meat. 200 push-ups while wearing a weighted vest? No problem. Jeff Bezos (also now buff) laid down the hammer at The Washington Post, demanding editors give him a "hell yes" to affirm they're all in on "personal liberties and free markets." Let's not forget Elon Musk, who over the last several years, has been challenging anyone from Zuckerberg to Vladimir Putin to single combat. Not in the least surprised by all this chest-thumping: women in business. The return of the alpha male CEO has engendered a new opponent, BI's Amanda Hoover writes. Female executives are fed up with the "billionaire boys in the sandbox," as one sociologist put it — and instead of waiting to be let in, some are building their own arenas. Fabrik founder Jaclyn Pascocello told BI that she is seeing a collective of women coming together and starting to build companies to address issues sometimes ignored by men. When companies won't offer the flexibility that working parents need, it can embolden people to become more entrepreneurial and build under their own terms. "Oftentimes the easiest way to find that is to build it yourself," Pascocello said. Amanda spoke with female founders, psychologists, and sociologists about the resurgent machoism in corporate America — and how female executives are fighting back. 1. Praying for returns? Look no further than religious ETFs. Faith-based investments are a small part of the ETF world, but rising religious fervor and President Trump's leadership are driving interest. However, these funds can be picky about what to include. 2. President Trump could be making the same mistake as Biden. Trump's economic policies have some worried about a potential recession, and the stock market has taken a hit. With the 2026 midterms not far off, Trump risks political damage by continuing to ignore the elephant in the room. 3. Has bitcoin already peaked this year? Betting markets seem to think so. They expect the cryptocurrency to reach $110,000, barely above its record price. Wall Street bulls beg to differ. 1. Jensen made a joke, but who's laughing? At Nvidia's big AI conference, CEO Jensen Huang joked that new Blackwell GPUs would render the company's older chip models obsolete. Its cloud giant customers might not find that very funny, though, since it would cost them billions. 2. You can get ChatGPT to make password-stealing malware. Just play pretend. Researchers cracked some LLMs' security features to generate code that could breach Google's password manager. The key? Make the chatbot pretend to be a superhero. 3. A former Point72 exec's new data startup wants to level the playing field. Kirk McKeown's Carbon Arc allows small funds and businesses to purchase private data by the megabyte — sometimes for less than $1. The startup's goal is to make it more accessible for anyone looking to trade or feed AI models. 1. Out: Ubering. In: Blading. The wealthy are ditching hired cars for helicopter services like Blade, where a nine-minute ride from Manhattan to JFK airport starts at $95. When a rush-hour Uber in the city can cost more than $100, that sounds like a deal. 2. Law firms split over Trump's attack. Elias Law Group rebuked Trump's Friday memo that warned firms against "frivolous" suits against his administration. Marc Elias said in a statement on Saturday that there would be "no negotiation" about the clients his firm represents. Meanwhile, after Paul Weiss struck a deal with Trump on Friday, its chairman, Brad Karp, sent an email to staff addressing their unease over the decision. 3. Freebies for federal workers. DC businesses are offering perks like free workout classes and financial planning sessions to federal employees as they navigate the uncertainty around their jobs. BI heard from five businesses on why they're stepping up. The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York (on parental leave). Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London. Grace Lett, editor, in Chicago. Amanda Yen, associate editor, in New York. Lisa Ryan, executive editor, in New York. Ella Hopkins, associate editor, in London. Elizabeth Casolo, fellow, in Chicago.

Title: SEBI Tightens Social Media Ad Rules for Registered Intermediaries
URL: https://www.medianama.com/2025/03/223-sebi-tightens-social-media-ad-rules-for-registered-intermediaries/
Time Published: 2025-03-24T11:45:21Z
Full Content:
MEDIANAMA Technology and policy in India The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has directed registered intermediaries uploading advertisements on social media platforms to use email IDs and mobile numbers registered on the SEBI intermediary (SI) portal while signing up. In an advisory issued on March 21, the regulator also directed such intermediaries to update their contact details on the SI portal by April 30, 2025. Further, Social Media Platform Providers (SMPPs) like Google and Meta would later conduct advertiser verification of such entities. SEBI’s new guidelines come amid rising frauds in the securities market on social media platforms including YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, X, Telegram, and app stores. The regulator noted the patterns like perpetrators luring victims in the guise of providing online trading courses and seminars, furnishing misleading testimonials, or guaranteeing risk-free returns on social media. Besides this, Ananth Narayan, SEBI’s whole-time member (WTM), also announced in a speech that the regulator, in collaboration with social media companies, has removed 70,000 misleading posts and handles since October 2024. However, this is not the first time SEBI has cautioned users and registered intermediaries of such activities on social media. In December 2024, the Board advised investors to not conduct transactions or share sensitive personal details on unauthorised or unregistered electronic platforms, noting that such platforms violate laws like the Securities Contract (Regulation) Act, 1956 and the SEBI Act, 1992. Previously, in August 2024, the Bombay and National Stock Exchanges furnished a joint report urging investors to refrain from joining social media forums like WhatsApp, Telegram, or Instagram channels providing stock recommendations or falsely offering trading opportunities through fake SEBI-issued certificates. The exchanges also highlighted other illegal online activities like offering “dabba” or illegal trading services, claims to facilitate pre-IPO subscriptions with false promises of assured profits, impersonating applications of registered trading members, etc. The intermediaries clarified that victims of such fraud communications can report these through the Sanchar Saathi Portal, the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal, or the 1930 cybercrime helpline number. Notably, in 2022 SEBI conducted raids in multiple cities across the country for operating Telegram channels which made recommendations of selected listed scrips, creating artificial volume and price rise. In 2024, SEBI also released a consultation paper highlighting when a platform is recognised as a ‘Specified Digital Platform’ (SDP), stipulating that these portals take measures like leveraging AI and ML to curb illegal activity on their platforms and prohibiting associations between unregistered influencers and registered intermediaries. Further, SDPs were directed to enable SEBI and its registered entities to escalate or report unlawful content alongside establishing a mechanism to report misleading content or advertisements. Debating the justification of this regulation, speakers at MediaNama’s discussion on “SEBI Platform and Influencer Regulations” disclosed that the law is all-encompassing and could even impact platforms like WhatsApp where users forward trading advice. Capital Mind Founder and CEO Deepak Shenoy also compared individuals offering free trading advice on platforms like YouTube to similar advice furnished on TV channels, with SEBI cracking down on the former and taking down videos from different creators and channels. Returning to the advisory, it also notes that SMPPs must conduct advertiser verification post the onboarding of such users. Google’s advertiser verification for financial services stipulates that entities must demonstrate that they are licensed by the relevant financial regulator—SEBI in this case—and later obtain third-party verification from Google’s vendor G2. Notably, advertisers, such as search engines or e-commerce platforms, who don’t promote financial services but have a “compelling reason to target users” seeking financial advice must also apply to G2. And evidently, only authorised representatives can submit such applications. This requirement for authorisation by relevant regulatory authorities extends to Meta’s advertiser verification process for countries like Taiwan, Australia, and the UK.

New research into how marketers are using AI and key insights into the future of marketing with AI. Updated: 03/24/25 Published: 03/14/25 AI agents are like the backstage crew at the concerts we attend: Operating independently on the backend to deliver a smooth experience on the user end. They power many of the tech we use – and have for a while – but haven’t gotten that visibility until recently. In this article, we’ll break down real-world examples of how AI agents are used across industries. Every time you sift through recommendations on your Netflix, you’re seeing AI agents at work. AI agents take action without constant human intervention by recognizing patterns and predicting behavior. When Netflix is recommending you shows to watch, that rec list has been compiled by an AI agent tasked with analyzing your watch history and ratings for trends and genre preferences. Brands like Amazon, YouTube, and Spotify all use similar agents to personalize user experience. New research into how marketers are using AI and key insights into the future of marketing. All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. Hotels, ride-hailing apps, and airlines all have one thing in common: Surge pricing – powered by AI agents. These companies operate on a flexible pricing structure that fluctuates based on factors like supply, demand, and user trends. Source Take Lyft for instance. If I order a ride at 2 a.m. on a Saturday during Art Basel, it will surely cost me more than on a Tuesday night at 8 a.m. When the user even places the request for a ride, the AI agent evaluates these factors, sets the price, and responds to the user’s request. OpenAI and Google have both introduced AI agents, – Operator and Mariner respectively – that can search the web independently and serve as a true assistant, filling up shopping carts and getting answers to your most pressing questions. “It can understand that it needs to press a button to make something happen,” Demis Hassabis, who oversees Google’s core A.I. lab, said in an interview with The NYT. “It can take action in the world.” Source While AI assistants escalate support requests and direct users toward self-service options, AI agents are working behind the scenes to: Sites built on user-generated content – think Reddit, YouTube, Meta – require advanced content moderation practices to keep users safe. Human moderators rely on AI agents to do some of the legwork of flagging, reviewing, and sorting content that goes against the site’s policies. Think about how good YouTube has gotten at flagging when a video includes copyrighted music. There’s no human reviewing each upload – instead, Google relies on AI systems to analyze content as they’re uploaded to the site and take actions if they’re not compliant. For instance, on YouTube, an uploaded video will be muted automatically if it includes copyrighted music. On TikTok, a content creator’s video will be first muted, then removed for review. These steps allow moderation teams to focus on higher priority work and automate routine tasks. When you’re spending money on an ad, you’re looking for return on investment (ROI). Doing so entails optimizing your ad after it’s placed – that can mean anything from doubling down on the version that performs the best to customizing the ad based on user history. While this can be done manually, it’s not scalable – and that’s where an AI agent comes in. Based on historical trends and performance data, advertisers can optimize their campaigns in real time, which saves them money and increases ROI. Recruiters on LinkedIn can now automate routine tasks like finding and following up with candidates, and scheduling interviews. Source According to LinkedIn, recruiters report spending around 20 hours a week on these tasks, and these AI agents can cut that time by half – at least. While I haven’t had the chance to (read: the guts to) ride in a Waymo, Google’s robotaxi, I can tell you a bit about how it works. To operate safely, Waymo vehicles must rely on AI systems to perceive their surroundings, understand other drivers’ behaviors, control the vehicle, and make safe driving decisions. It relies on real-time and historical data to guide and adapt its actions. Tesla’s AutoPilot feature is another example of an AI agent at work. The stock market is unpredictable. Imagine if you had an AI agent tracking it during pre- and open market hours to recommend strategies? Beyond recommendations, consumers and businesses alike are beginning to leverage AI agents to make trades based on their own risk profiles and investment strategies. U.S. hospitals and healthcare orgs, like Mayo Clinic, are piloting the use of AI agents for a series of administrative tasks, including: “For some years now, we‘ve collected mountains of data in EHRs and data lakes but struggled to translate those insights into meaningful impact. Too often, it’s added more burden to clinicians instead of relieving it," said the executive director for Atlantic Health System, an org overseeing over 550 medical care sites, to Becker’s Health It. The next time you get a fraud alert notification from your bank, you’ve likely got an AI agent to thank. (Or rather the team who configured it.) In the banking space, AI agents monitor users’ transaction activity and track spending habits. When they flag behaviors that fall outside of routine, they’ll respond by freezing cards, alerting users, and requesting transaction approvals. BMW is one of many companies using AI-powered robots to streamline production lines. They operate through a series of complex AI systems that assign them tasks and program them to adjust their behavior based on historical data. Alongside humans, production lines function much more smoothly, allowing workers to focus on higher-impact tasks that require human oversight. As you can now see, AI agents are working all around us.

Title: Google ignored Android XR at GDC 2025, and indie VR devs are concerned

One Quest gaming dev told us that "Google is treading the same path towards failure" as Stadia and Daydream by shutting smaller devs out. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Google made no effort to reach out to indie VR and XR game developers at GDC 2025. Combined with social media reports that most top-selling Quest devs were "rejected" from Google's Android XR boot camps, it's painting a worrying picture about what to expect from Android-based headsets like Project Moohan. Google loves GDC; it has a huge presence there every year. This year, its panel on real-world AI applications in game development filled up 45 minutes before it started. It had several Android gaming panels and a large Play Store exhibition in the West hall, and it partnered with Samsung on another Galaxy panel. GDC is well-known for its private hotel demos off the show floor. Perhaps Google made an Android XR push behind closed doors with larger VR publishers. But Google's decision not to court indie VR devs publicly with panels or demos — at the same conference where Meta pushed its new passthrough tech and reassured devs how profitable their store is — seems pretty telling. It's all but guaranteed that the Google I/O 2025 program in May will have workshops on Android XR — to court 2D app devs. Gaming rarely comes up at I/O, and this platform is public, so it's not as though Google needs to wait for some big reveal. Will Google have the same disdainful approach to VR gaming that Apple does with the Apple Vision Pro? At least one VR gaming dev we spoke to thinks that Android XR is already heading in the wrong direction by spurning the people who made Quest headsets so popular. The Quest Store is flooded with meme games, social multiplayer targeting teens, and indie content you'd typically see on Steam. It turns off many VR elites and frustrates VR devs making "serious" content, but these games strike a chord and keep people returning to the Quest 3S headsets more regularly to spend money. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Android XR is compatible with Unity, OpenXR, and WebXR, with controller support built into the UI. During our press preview, they suggested that headsets like Samsung's Project Moohan "support gaming use cases." They said that "hopefully" this universal compatibility "will lead to incentives for people to port over to Android." You'd think the owner of the Play Store would recognize the power of smaller developers to strike it big and reach out to those developers to give Android XR greater visibility. Instead, according to developer RJ White at Soaring Roc Studio, "9/10 top devs for the Quest platform" have been rejected from Android XR coding boot camps, and he sees this as a premature death knell for the platform. I've seen 9/10 top devs for the Quest platform rejected for @GoogleARVR's bootcamps for Android XR now. I'm talking about devs / people with games that were in the top 5 top selling. Google is so quick to repeat their mistakes from Daydream, see y'all on @killedbygoogle soon pic.twitter.com/JOH2AJ7gwiFebruary 20, 2025 "Google is treading the same path towards failure that they did with Stadia and Daydream. By shutting out some of the most experienced and smaller studios and developers, they're showing they've learned zero lessons with how to manage or grow a modern software platform," said White in a discussion with Android Central senior editor Nick Sutrich. White, whose indie studio has made several Quest titles like Spiders and FireZone, says that studios and games from "humble origins" power huge successes from major platforms. However, he believes Google is "too focused on trying to force a polished diamond out of a large team as quickly as possible" instead of "cultivating an environment that lets those smaller teams thrive and carve a gem out on their own." "XR developers aren't just game developers; they're 3D interaction experts," says White. However, by rejecting them and prioritizing the same "just make things flat" approach as Apple, Android XR will be "2D dependent to a fault." White's thoughts don't prove Android XR is bound to fail, and we don't have evidence that Google is fully ignoring Quest developers beyond word of mouth. Rather, it reflects a perspective among some VR developers that without overtures from Google, it's hard to know how much stock to put into Android XR — or whether Google knows what it needs to do to make it successful. Big Tech wants to make productivity XR headsets the new alternative to laptops, but none of the big-name consumer products have sold at a massive scale. Apple allegedly sold 500,000 Vision Pros, and Samsung wants to sell 100,000 Moohan headsets. VR gaming remains the one definitive use case that has attracted millions of users. So, is there a reason why Google wouldn't prioritize it? Samsung's Project Infinity headset is rumored to have Sony-made micro-OLED displays with 13.64 million pixels per eye, arriving in the second half of 2025 with a hefty price tag. Beyond that, other announced Android XR devices include a Sony enterprise headset that'll cost almost $5,000, Xreal AR glasses, and an unconfirmed Lynx XR headset that may trend toward the pricey side. So perhaps Google wants to focus its outreach to the enterprise and productivity app creators because it knows people won't spend thousands of dollars to play Gorilla Tag when the Quest 3 is already here. It needs a "killer app" to justify its existence, and Google must assume that app won't be a game. Maybe Google truly believes that gaming developers don't need an Android XR boot camp because they can easily port over OpenXR games without much effort. Perhaps, as White suggests, they're underestimating these XR developers' ability to do more than gaming software and create useful 3D app content, whether for headsets or AR glasses. We know Android XR will have similar camera tech to the Quest's new passthrough API, but Google didn't come to GDC to appeal to XR devs as Meta did. Or maybe Google is following the lead of its hardware partners, who don't care as much about gaming. If Samsung decides to make a Quest rival, then Google could prioritize gaming, right? Frankly, whatever Google's reasoning, I'm not a fan of Google potentially downplaying the importance of gaming for the future of Android XR. It should be building up momentum now so that devs are ready to overload Project Moohan with content by the end of the year. Hopefully, by Google I/O in May, VR gaming devs will have more reason for optimism that Android XR is a viable new platform for them.

Title: Five Critical Indicators To Gauge Recession Risk
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/03/23/five-critical-indicators-to-gauge-recession-risk/
Time Published: 2025-03-23T11:00:00Z

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone Contributor. The decline in stock prices combined with plunging consumer sentiment and uncertainty surrounding ... More tariffs has uncreased uncertainty about future economic growth. Since stock prices ultimately depend on earnings, the pace of economic growth is crucial input to future stock performance. After briefly hitting correction territory in the previous week, which is defined as a 10% decline from an earlier high, stocks had a modest rebound last week. The S&P 500 sits 7.6% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has faired worse with a drubbing of 18.5% since mid-December. The pressure on stocks stems from an economic growth scare and policy uncertainty surrounding tariffs. Market Returns With the S&P 500 closing over 10% below its February 19 high on Thursday, March 13, stocks officially entered a correction. In the twenty-one U.S. stock market corrections since 1980, the average return in the 12 months following was 13.4%, which on the surface would lead to significant optimism regarding future returns. If the data is sorted between periods when the U.S. economy entered recession within those 12 months after the correction, the results are less compelling at a 1.9% average gain. Of course, if an economic downturn is avoided, the results have been spectacular on average at 19.1%. Average Stock Returns After S&P 500 Correction The strong bond between avoiding recession and better returns following a stock correction makes monitoring the economy's health even more critical. Economists' consensus estimate of 2025 economic growth has dipped slightly to 2.2%, nowhere near recessionary levels. Unfortunately, economists have a poor track record of accurately predicting economic growth with enough lead time, and consensus estimates tend to lag behind real-time data. Consensus U.S. Economic Growth Forecasts Economic models attempting to forecast the current quarter of GDP growth were developed to address the challenges associated with consensus estimates. These estimates adapt to the most recent economic releases to predict growth. This methodology has its challenges but adds additional color to the economic backdrop. The Atlanta Fed model points to a contraction in economic activity in the first quarter, which is probably overstated because much of that downward estimate comes from a marked increase in imports to avoid future tariffs. The St. Louis Fed’s model remains in positive territory. The forecast difference between the two is vast for their first-quarter GDP estimate. After last week's Federal Reserve meeting, the committee noted that “uncertainty around the economy outlook has increased.” Estimated Frist-Quarter U.S. Economic Growth While accurately forecasting an economic downturn in advance with any accuracy is exceptionally challenging, monitoring some high-frequency data can help get an early warning about increased recession risks. These indicators were chosen because they are updated weekly or daily and have shown a strong correlation with economic activity. Indeed, other indicators are crucial, but they are typically only available monthly, sometimes with a significant time lag. The labor market is probably the most crucial part of the economy since consumer spending eventually wanes without wages to fund the purchases. Initial claims for unemployment benefits are reported weekly, but the four-week moving average of claims is used here to reduce volatility. While initial claims are above the lows, the level is not exhibiting a strong uptrend or at a level consistent with economic woes. Initial Jobless Claims The other weekly job data is ongoing claims for unemployment benefits, which are also off its lows and show a slow uptrend. This indicates that it is taking longer for those losing their jobs to find a new one. Remember that the number of employees in the U.S. has more than doubled since 1970, so even though the current roster of those receiving unemployment benefits is as high as it was during the 1969-1970 recession, the numbers aren’t comparable. The bottom line is that the labor market is softening but has not yet reached recessionary levels. Continuing Claims The corporate bond market should undoubtedly be part of the mosaic to monitor the economy’s health. Baa corporate bond data has a long history and arguably provides a look at the “typical” credit quality of companies, as Baa credit rating is the lowest level of investment-grade bonds. The spread is the yield investors demand beyond U.S. Treasury bond rates to compensate for the default risk from buying corporate bonds. These spreads expand when investors worry that more bond defaults could be on the horizon, typically driven by deteriorating economic conditions. While the spreads on Baa corporate debt are above recent lows, the increase seems insufficient to trigger substantial fear of any impending economic downturn. Corporate Bond Spreads The Chicago Fed produces the National Financial Conditions Index weekly. It looks at 105 measures across three categories, risk, credit, and leverage, to create a measure of financial conditions. According to the Chicago Fed, “Positive values of the NFCI have been historically associated with tighter-than-average financial conditions, while negative values have been historically associated with looser-than-average financial conditions.” The chart shows that these periods of tighter-than-normal financial conditions have often been associated with recession. Like the previous measures, financial conditions have worsened but remain below warning levels. Financial Conditions The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have recently been underperforming the less economically sensitive defensive stocks. This suggests that an economic growth scare is one cause of the recent stock weakness. While it should continue to be monitored, the relative weakness of cyclical stocks has improved off its most recent lows and isn’t at the level seen before past recessions. Performance Of Cyclical Stocks The 10-year Treasury minus 2-year yield is probably the most well-known predictor of recession. Historically, when the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury falls below the 2-year yield, also called yield curve inverting, a recession is coming. Since the 1970s, a yield curve inversion has occurred before every recession. The only blemishes on its record are the 1998 and mid-2022 inversions, which produced no subsequent economic recessions. The U.S. economy did see a significant slowdown in the first half of 2022 but rebounded in the second half. Unfortunately, even when the signal is correct, it has variable lead and lag times. The yield curve still has a better prediction track record than the economists and is used in about every Federal Reserve model, so it is worth watching despite its warts. The curve is not currently inverted, so this model forecasts no recession. The Yield Curve & Recessions The economic calendar releases for the week are not of the highest importance. The two most notable are February durable goods orders on Wednesday and personal income and spending on Friday. Last week, the Federal Reserve left its projected rate cuts at two but increased the inflation and unemployment forecasts. In addition, the median forecast for GDP growth was lowered. Markets saw this as a somewhat dovish signal and pushed expectations closer to three cuts for 2025, with the first in June. Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected Correctly forecasting a recession is challenging in the best of times, but the post-COVID-19 period, with its irregular economic cycles, makes it even more perilous. These high-frequency indicators should provide a reasonable early warning system for a sizable economic contraction. Currently, the odds point to an economic slowdown rather than a recession, which bodes well for reasonable returns from the correction bottom. As always, there are no easy calls when it comes to forecasting the short-term movement of stocks or the economy, especially in a period of increased uncertainty around the severity of the tariffs. For example, though most are rightly concerned about the downside risk from tariffs, there is an upside if somehow this pressure results in better trade terms for U.S. companies. There is always uncertainty. So, investors should have a portfolio with enough cash and bonds to cover short-term expenses. This cushion can help moderate the impact of stock declines on a portfolio and allow one to withstand the inevitable stock declines to experience the benefits of long-term ownership. Within the stock portion, focus should be paid to companies that can weather economic dislocations and perhaps even take advantage of them, regardless of their stock price movement.

Title: Trump Wants to Boost Crypto ‘Stablecoins’ (Which Are Far From Stable)

Time Published: 2025-03-22T13:30:00Z

By Mark Hays President Donald Trump’s recent cockamamie proposal to create a strategic cryptocurrency reserve has been the big crypto news, and not without good reason: It’s an illogical idea, has already caused a small crypto bubble featuring insider trading, and appears to be a quid pro quo for crypto political donors. Even some crypto enthusiasts think it’s a bad idea and a waste of taxpayer money. But the crypto industry has been laser-focused on something more significant: A bill that was voted out of the Senate Banking Committee earlier this month would greenlight a class of crypto assets known as “stablecoins.” Normalizing stablecoins into the fabric of the financial system is critical to broader acceptance of crypto and the crypto casino by banks and other financial firms. Trump appeared to endorse the legislation on Thursday in a video address to the Digital Asset Summit 2025, saying that he has “called on Congress to pass landmark legislation creating simple, common-sense rules for stablecoins and market structure.” If this weak bill becomes law and legitimizes these not-so-stable-coins, the next crypto crash could be far more calamitous for crypto enthusiasts as well as the real economy. What, you might ask, is a stablecoin? Well, most cryptocurrencies lack tangible underlying value, making them highly speculative — people will pay whatever they think other people are willing to pay for them. This makes them infamously volatile and not especially useful to make transactions or as a replacement for money. It’s hard to pay for a loaf of bread, a gallon of milk, or a stick of butter if your crypto token is worth one dollar now, one cent an hour later, or ten cents the hour after that. Enter stablecoins. These cryptocurrencies are assigned a consistent price tied to (or pegged to) an existing currency (such as the U.S. dollar), and they are backed by a reserve of collateral assets that theoretically can repay investors quickly. People buy stablecoins from an issuer with the promise that their price will stay stable and that they can sell them back to (or redeem them with) the issuer at any time, in full, at their stated price, because the issuer has enough collateral assets on hand to pay them back. Editor’s picks The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time Stablecoins are largely used for crypto investing, like poker chips in a casino. You use your regular money to buy chips to play roulette, then cash out your winnings with the house when you’re done. Crypto investors use stablecoins to buy and sell far more volatile cryptocurrencies. Using stablecoins for these purchases can have lower transaction or conversion fees than using cash. Most crypto investors use stablecoins as a pool of relatively stable, liquid assets more easily available for crypto investing. But the holy grail of stablecoin promoters is using them for payments. Boosters want stablecoins to replace your debit or credit card as a tool for buying ordinary goods and services, claiming blockchain technology will make that whole process faster and cheaper. In some countries with highly volatile currency and clunky payment systems, some people use stablecoins for cross-border transactions. But in the United States, it is far easier to use your card; the idea we would convert our paychecks to stablecoins to buy groceries is a bit laughable. Which means the only practical use for stablecoins is gambling on crypto. But there’s truly nothing new under the sun. Stablecoins resemble two existing financial products — bank deposits and money market mutual funds. Banks hold your money, keep records of your account transactions, and give you your money on demand, which theoretically stablecoin issuers also do. And money market mutual funds are used as a slush fund for other investments, like stablecoins are for crypto speculation. Related Content Trump’s SEC Nominee Consulted for Wall Street, Big Oil, Crypto Interests Trump Team's War Plans Group Chat Triggers Avalanche of Memes Republicans Are Trying (and Failing) to Defend Reckless War-Plans Group Chat Former Social Security Chief Courts Florida Seniors Enraged by Musk’s Cuts But both bank accounts and money market mutual funds operate under robust regulations, for good reasons. The history of banking includes bank runs and failures, including in recent years — even with safety and soundness regulations and deposit insurance. And runs on money market mutual funds helped amplify the 2008 financial crisis. Investors had lots of money parked in what they assumed were safe accounts. But, when big firms like Lehman Brothers failed, investors rushed to cash out, fueling the stock market meltdown that reverberated throughout the financial system. Stablecoins have already exhibited these same problems that have left investors in the lurch without any guardrails. Stablecoins frequently become unhooked from their pegged value and many of them lack reliable reserves so that people can get their money out promptly. In fact, a study by international economists that looked at 60 different stablecoins found that they all had lost their peg at least once. Meaning they are anything but stable. Terraform Lab’s Terra/Luna stablecoin, an esoteric algorithmic stablecoin backed by little more than fancy computer code, was touted by crypto bros as a revolution in finance and was a darling of crypto venture capitalists. But it was a fraudulent house of cards. When Terra’s delicate algorithm began to melt down, investors bailed and Terra collapsed, triggering the 2022 crypto crash. The episode revealed that Big Crypto is just like Big Wall Street, where a handful of deeply intertwined firms can rapidly spread financial contagion. When one collapsed, the others soon followed. Tether is the number one issuer of stablecoins, and it is seen as a kind of central bank of crypto that props up global crypto trading. But Tether has already settled with the New York Attorney General and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to resolve claims it misled investors about whether it had enough reserves to cover its coins, and failed to complete audits of its reserve assets. It’s also increasingly the stablecoin of choice for money launderers. Even Circle, considered a more serious U.S.-based stablecoin issuer, became unhitched from its price peg in 2023 when the crypto friendly Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapsed. $3.3 billion of Circle’s allegedly safe reserves were held in uninsured deposits at SVB. Had federal regulators not quickly stepped in and spent billions to keep Circle and SVB depositors whole, the entire crypto industry could have imploded. Right now, these stablecoins have almost no federal oversight even though they behave like some pretty ordinary and regulated financial products. So, enacting some regulations for these sketchy things sounds good, right? Not so fast. The Senate proposal has been largely crafted by industry and would essentially allow stablecoin issuers to have their cake and eat it too. It would give stablecoins many of the privileges associated with banking, but fewer of the same responsibilities. For example, the bill would not require stablecoin issuers to get private deposit insurance or have truly stable and robust reserves. Regulators would have little ability to look under the hood, and stablecoin issuers could seek out states with light-touch regulatory regimes to approve their coins. But the bill’s greatest risk is that it would allow Big Tech platforms like Amazon, Meta, or X to become stablecoin issuers. Congress has long prohibited non-financial firms from becoming banks because the combination of commerce and banking is a recipe for disaster. Company-owned banks have incentives to make imprudent investments in their affiliates, and if the affiliate stumbles, the bank can go down with it. But this bill ignores that firewall almost entirely. A Big Tech-issued stablecoin would be company scrip for the 21st century. An Amazon with Bezos Bucks would be not only the dominant retailer of goods, but also a de facto bank, issuing its own currency and holding deposits for millions of customers. It could control access, surveil transactions, manipulate the pricing of goods, and the price of its bespoke money. Or, if X printed Musk Bucks, it could cut off access on a political whim. And if either company went under due to a supply chain crisis or bad management, the collapse could wipe out people’s stablecoin accounts and crater the real economy. In 2019, when Meta (then Facebook) proposed its own Libra stablecoin, there was bipartisan opposition that ultimately tanked the idea. Today, stablecoin backers include both Republicans and Democrats like Senator Gillibrand. What’s changed is that the crypto industry has poured a gusher of money onto a now sycophantic Congress. They have installed crypto hucksters in the White House and in federal financial agencies. Trump has embraced the industry, saying the U.S. will be the crypto capital of the world and creating his own crypto meme coin, while his family operates their own crypto exchange. This week, he called on Congress to pass stablecoin legislation during a taped address to a crypto trade group summit. Now the cryptocrats have their best chance to enshrine their anti-government and self-interested ideas into federal law. This is all part and parcel of Elon Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency’s assault on the federal government, including trying to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and defang banking regulators (just as Musk launches his own financial services platform).

Why Didn’t Anyone Believe Her? ‘Is Waltz Jonah From Veep?’: Team Trump Fumes Over Its Most Idiotic Scandal Yet And crypto CEOs are demanding Congress pass an industry-friendly stablecoin bill to demonstrate their fealty, but also to pave the way for much worse crypto craziness to come. Stablecoins are really only good for gambling in crypto markets, and this bill is the lynchpin to exposing the entire financial system to the crypto casino. The crypto bros are high fiving over soaring crypto prices now, but once the banks and financial firms are exposed to not only the booms but also the busts, the real economy will be put at greater risk. In 2022, the crypto industry lost over $2 trillion in value. But your bank probably didn’t go under because it wasn’t up to its neck in crypto. But this stablecoin bill — and likely worse bills to follow — could change that, if we’re all suddenly exposed to the risk, fraud, and instability this industry represents. We want to hear it.

Title: The SEC Resets Its Crypto Relationship

Time Published: 2025-03-22T12:30:00Z

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is looking to reset its relationship with the crypto industry, even before a permanent chair is confirmed by Congress. The latest effort was Friday's roundtable, hosted at the SEC's headquarters in Washington, D.C. and featuring a dozen attorneys representing different views and positions within the crypto industry. You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. The SEC's reset began when Acting Chair Mark Uyeda launched a crypto task force and oversaw his agency withdraw Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, drop a number of ongoing lawsuits, pause a few more and publish multiple staff statements about how the agency might look at memecoins and proof-of-work mining. The SEC is arguably the most important federal regulator in crypto at the moment. While its sister agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, may be the regulator that might one day oversee crypto spot markets, right now it's the SEC that most companies in the sector look to for guidance on what, exactly, it is they can do. The roundtable was split into two portions (three, if you count introductory remarks from the three commissioners): A roughly 90-minute moderated panel discussion, led by former SEC Commissioner and Paredes Strategies founder Troy Paredes, and a 90-minute town hall still moderated by Paredes but featuring questions from the general public. You can read CoinDesk's coverage of the panel discussion at this link. Though the central question during the discussion was — as it has been for years — when and how exactly is a crypto or crypto transaction a security, panelists touched on everything from the role of crypto in boosting ransomware to how exactly companies should operate. Chris Brummer, the CEO of Bluprynt and professor at Georgetown Law, opened up the discussion with his analysis of what the Howey Test actually means: We're basically saying when you have savings, there's an issue of investor protection. The common enterprise prong that we're all familiar with is really addressing a kind of providing problem." "It really just goes to information asymmetries, and then the question of profits goes to investor psychology, greed and fear, the kinds of things that can distort decision-making," he said. "And basically, when you have all those factors together, you have a mandated disclosure [rule]." The SEC's approach thus far has limited a number of crypto projects, Delphi Ventures General Counsel Sarah Brennan said. While many crypto projects are intended to have a broad initial distribution, "the specter of the applications of securities laws" means many projects act more like they'll go public than actually embrace the crypto aspects of their projects. "We see more and more the token is the product … there's different ways that people are artificially supporting price and it's generally been, I'd say, sort of toxic to the market," she said. John Reed Stark, a former SEC attorney, said that the "economic reality of the transaction" is critical. "However you want to look at it, the people buying crypto are not collectors," he said. "We all know that they're investors, and the mission of the SEC is to protect investors." It remains to be seen how the SEC's efforts will continue, but the agency is taking a more active role in publicly engaging with these questions and the industry seems to be responding. The SEC auditorium was about three-quarters full at times, to say nothing of anyone who tuned into the livestream.

Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in AppLovin during the relevant time frame, you have until May 5, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.

Full Content:
UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MARCH 21 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets.

As of Thursday, the two largest stocks, Nvidia and Apple, were down by almost 14% and 12%, respectively this year. Other well-known AI plays followed closely behind. As of Thursday, Broadcom was down by over 17%, Arista Networks by 25%, and Marvell Technology by over 37% this year. DeepSeek's debut, which introduced a software-efficient solution to investors in late January, marked a peak reversal for this sector. A new reality has kicked in: Big Tech isn't immune to market competition, which is causing investors to sober up from their valuation-induced highs. "We've essentially seen the AI stocks on a downward trend ever since then, said Dave Sekera, Morningstar's chief US market strategist. "Most of those stocks have sold off anywhere between 15% to 20%. So pretty close to what would be considered a bear market in AI stocks." Risk-off moves followed the reversal as economic fears mounted from trade wars and slowing GDP growth. The bad news is, if you have heavy exposure to AI, you're portfolio is likely down. The good news is that some of these formerly expensive companies are now in fair-value territory, according to Morningstar's five-star valuation system, which considers a company's fundamentals relative to its trading price. This year, Sekera expects investor attention to move away from Big Tech and toward companies integrating AI into their products and services to drive additional revenue growth, improve customer retention, and boost productivity and efficiency. So, at this point, investors have three options. The first is to chase the crowd into a later phase of the AI trade, where bets are being made on which companies will successfully integrate AI for wider profit margins. Or, stay behind and look for sales on AI's picks and shovel stocks. Finally, they can choose to seek out more speculative opportunities in leading-edge sectors like robotics. Either way, the market could remain choppy, and volatility must be an accepted part of the trade. Stock picks The software sector is a great place to look for AI bargains. Stocks in this corner were dumped in a flight to risk-off trades, including those with solid business models and recurring revenue growth, which brings us to the main point: if you're screening for names here, you'll want to focus on revenue growth above all else because the industry's perk is that it can grow fast, said Dan Romanoff, a senior equity research analyst for technology at Morningstar. "You can just draw a chart that compares software multiples versus revenue growth. And the higher the revenue growth, the higher the multiples will be, even if the company is losing money," Romanoff said. "If you're looking at your portfolio holistically, tech is usually providing the most growth within your portfolio, and so you want to lean into the growth where you can get it." The key is to find the best growth story, he added. And the answer may not always be the company making the widest strides but rather the one that has shown sustainability in its revenue growth. In other words, a bump in revenue could be temporary due to a product release, which could fizzle out in the next quarter, he said. Knowing the difference is key to deciphering between a short-term trade and a long-term investment opportunity. Within software, stocks that are now well-priced include Microsoft. As of Thursday, it was down by almost 7% this year. But it's still a harbor in a storm because of its blue-chip name, he noted. It has a monopoly in desktop operating systems with Windows. It has a near monopoly in productivity software in the office suites. Then, it piled on GenAI tools, which has catapulted it into a leadership spot in the AI race, Romanoff said. Its Azure is also a cloud provider in a three-horse race with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. Romanoff believes cloud providers will be the real winners in GenAI because inference happens on these servers. Adobe is another software firm to bet on. It's not a pure AI play, which is positive because it means the company has a solid, long-running business. The stock is down by over 10% this year. It's being dumped because investors fear GenAI will take over. After all, GenAI is improving at creating images and could circumvent the need for Adobe's platform. But Romanoff believes Adobe's FireFly, which provides AI-based text-to-image and text-to-video options, will remain necessary. "You're still going to need tools to edit the content that is created by a generative AI model," Romanoff said. "If you're in advertising and creating a campaign, the images you create need to be very specifically edited to create, inform, and define the brand image you want." Finally, there's ServiceNow. It's a company that has successfully provided customer service and IT platforms. Its Q4 revenue was up by 21.34% from last year. But the stock is down almost 22% this year. They have a solid, long-running business with only a small part of their revenue coming from GenAI offerings, Romanoff noted. Their annual recurring revenue, which is a key metric for software providers, has been on a solid growth trajectory, he added. If you're curious about where the rest of the Magnificent 7 are trading, some are now well-priced, too. According to Morningstar's five-star rating system, which factors in volatility and uncertainty, these three names are now rated at four-stars: Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META). Additional picks and shovel names that are now well priced and thus four-stars are ASML (ASML), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Marvell International (MRVL). For investors who want to make a more leading-edge bet, cheap or not, robotics is set to take off as automation integrates with AI. The two sectors combined now make up 1% of global GDP. And that's expected to increase to a whopping 35% by 2040, according to VettaFi. Demand will come from manufacturing, healthcare, logistics, and agriculture end users. And that runway creates a trillion-dollar opportunity for investors. However, betting in this sector can be trickier since a company's past fundamentals won't be the best measure of its future success. Here, Zeno Mercer, an investor and researcher in Deep Tech at VettaFi, says companies must be evaluated based on their contribution to relevant AI or robotics subsectors. They also need to be assessed on their technological leadership, their position within the market, such as who they are partnered with, and whether they're making strategic investments that will grow their presence. VettaFi's ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index is one place to look for leading global companies in this arena. The Index's top holdings include names like Harmonic Drive Systems, which makes precision control equipment for robots; Fanuc Corp, a robotics manufacturer; and GEA Group AG, an industrial, pharmaceutical, and chemical equipment manufacturer.

Title: Discussing Lands' End with ChatGPT

Helping CEOs Understand How Customers Interact With Advertising, Products, Brands, and Channels Y'all realize, of course, that your utter dependence on Facebook/Google for new customers puts the future health of your business at serious risk, right? Here's a discussion I had with ChatGPT. Kevin: Lands' End seems to rely heavily on discounts and promotions as part of its core business strategy for several reasons: Constant discounts create a sense of getting a deal, which encourages customers to buy more. If customers feel like they’re getting high-quality products at a reduced price, they’re more likely to make a purchase — even if the "original" price was inflated to allow for the discount. Over time, Lands' End has trained its customer base to expect discounts. If you know there’s always a sale around the corner, you might hesitate to buy at full price — but you'll jump at a 40% off email. This creates a shopping pattern where customers are almost waiting for the next sale to make a purchase. The apparel industry is highly competitive, especially in the mid-tier, classic, and outdoor clothing markets where Lands' End operates. Competitors like L.L.Bean, Eddie Bauer, and even department stores frequently run sales. Lands' End likely feels the need to match or exceed these offers to stay relevant. Frequent sales help clear out seasonal and excess inventory. Lands' End sells a lot of seasonal clothing (coats, swimsuits, etc.), so offering regular discounts helps prevent stock from piling up and reduces storage costs. Lands' End has always leaned heavily on direct mail and email marketing. Regular discounts give them a reason to send those emails and catalogs ("Get 30% Off Now!") and drive immediate sales spikes. Lands' End likely sets its initial prices higher, knowing that a large percentage of sales will happen at a discount. That way, even after applying a 30%–50% off promo, they can still maintain a healthy profit margin. That depends — what’s your size and fit preference? Lands' End is known for offering a pretty wide range of sizes, including: They’re also known for more relaxed, classic fits rather than slim or trendy cuts. If you prefer a roomy, comfortable fit, you’ll probably have good luck. Plus, they tend to use quality materials (like down, PrimaLoft, and waterproof fabrics) at reasonable prices, especially when you catch one of their sales. What kind of outerwear are you thinking — a winter coat, rain jacket, or something lighter? 👀 Kevin: I need a rain jacket, mens, size = 3x. Got it! Lands' End does carry men's rain jackets in 3X, and their outerwear tends to be pretty size-inclusive. Their Squall® jackets are a popular choice — waterproof, windproof, and lined for extra warmth. They also have some lighter rain shells if you’re looking for something less insulated. Want me to check what’s available right now or help narrow down the options? 🌧️😊 Kevin: Yes, and please recommend cheaper options from competing brands (links and images were provided, FYI). Certainly! Here are some men's rain jacket options in size 3X, including selections from Lands' End and more affordable alternatives from other brands: Lands' End Men's Big Waterproof Rain Jacket This jacket features a wind-and-waterproof 2.5-layer shell with a breathable, moisture-wicking interior membrane. It includes an adjustable hood, front and chest zipper pockets, and underarm zippers for ventilation. Available in size 3X. Portwest US440 Classic Waterproof Rain Jacket An affordable option, this jacket is waterproof with sealed seams and a pack-away hood. It's available in olive color, size 3X. Frogg Toggs Men's Rain Suit This rain suit includes both a jacket and pants, offering waterproof protection. Frogg Toggs is known for lightweight and breathable rainwear. Sizes up to 3X are available. Columbia Men's Rain Jackets Columbia offers a range of waterproof and breathable rain jackets. Some styles are available in extended sizes, including 3X. REI Co-op Men's Rain Jackets REI carries various men's rain jackets from brands like Marmot and The North Face. Some options are available in size 3X. When selecting a rain jacket, consider factors like waterproofing, breathability, and additional features such as adjustable hoods and ventilation options. Lands' End offers quality options, and brands like Portwest and Frogg Toggs provide more budget-friendly alternatives without compromising on essential features. Now, I'm asking questions like a moron, not like a human being. But please pay attention to the judgments that ChatGPT makes about Lands' End and other companies (calling Portwest budget-friendly). Imagine the content that ChatGPT had to "steal" to train itself to make judgments about who Lands' End is, who they compete with, and the give-and-take between catalogs / email / discounts? From a commerce standpoint, Google and Facebook are "dead men walking" ... via their current business model. If you are having conversations with AI and AI is steering you where it wants via judgements made by equations that are easy to create but hard to understand, you won't sit in front of a laptop typing questions on Google then visiting landsend.com, will you? That personal relationship you have with your customers ... either via the community you created, or via your own email/sms marketing program ... are about to become critically important. Ultimately, your email/sms program is going to be replaced by something interactive, but until then that personal relationship is going to be so darn important. Also ... what do you do when AI makes judgments about your brand that you don't like? Gonna be a wild ride. P.S.: This is the point where some of the hounds come after me ... "Kevin, Meta isn't stealing content, they're using readily available information to train AI to be smarter." Well, I searched LibGen to see if Meta used my information, and yes, they used several of my booklets to train their AI. Which, of course, is stealing. And yes, there's nothing I can do about it so complaining is meaningless. I have to adapt and move on. ChatGPT tells me that it makes a distinction between creating new ideas and synthesizing existing ideas. Oh. Great. Also faulty logic.
