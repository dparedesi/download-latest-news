This is Naked Capitalism fundraising week. 1351 donors have already invested in our efforts to combat corruption and predatory conduct, particularly in the financial realm. Please join us and participate via our donation page, which shows how to give via check, credit card, debit card, PayPal, Clover, or Wise. Read about why we’re doing this fundraiser,what we’ve accomplished in the last year, and our current goal, original reporting Yves here. In our post on the high odds of an eventual AI stock bubble collapse, we pointed out that debt or dollar distress could, as happened in 1987, set off a stock market unraveling. We were remiss in that post in not pointing out how runs on stablecoins and collapses in the value of stablecoin derivatives could in and of themselves trigger a crisis, or trigger a series of financial asset value plunges. This article helps remedy that lapse. By Arthur E. Wilmarth, Professor Emeritus of Law, George Washington University. Originally published at the Institute of New Economic Thinking website The GENIUS Act is a disastrous law that poses grave and unacceptable threats to our financial and economic future. Congress must remove those threats by (1) repealing the GENIUS Act and passing legislation that requires all stablecoin providers to be FDIC-insured banks, and (2) adopting legislation that requires all crypto derivatives to comply with the rules governing non-digital derivatives under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. On July 18, 2025, the President Trump signed into law the ‘‘Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act” (GENIUS Act). The GENIUS Act – despite its Orwellian sobriquet – is a profoundly misguided lawthat creates enormous dangers for our financial system, economy, and society. The GENIUS Act authorizes nonbanks to issue uninsured stablecoins to the public without the essential safeguards provided by federal deposit insurance and the prudential regulations governing FDIC-insured banks. In addition, the GENIUS Act gives federal and state regulators broad authority to allow nonbank stablecoin issuers to sell highly-leveraged crypto derivatives and other speculative crypto investments to the public. As shown below, the GENIUS Act plants the seeds for a crypto-fueled “Subprime 2.0” financial crisis that could be even worse than the global financial crisis of 2007-09. The GENIUS Act places the federal government’s seal of approval on uninsured and weakly-regulated nonbank stablecoins as well as hazardous crypto derivatives. By doing so, the GENIUS Act has greatly increased the likelihood that future runs on stablecoins and fire sales of crypto derivativeswill trigger systemic crises in our financial markets that have devastating spillover effects on our economy. The GENIUS Act also opens the door for Big Tech firms and other commercial enterprises to issue and distribute stablecoins and conduct a crypto-based banking business. Allowing commercial and technology giants to offer stablecoins and other risky crypto investments will greatly increase the risk that future crypto crashes will engulf our entire economy. In view of the federal government’s massive debt burden and rapidly rising debt service costs, it is extremely doubtful whether federal agencies could arrange another set of comprehensive bailouts without triggering a sovereign debt crisis. To remove the intolerable threats posed by uninsured nonbank stablecoins and crypto derivatives, Congress should repeal the GENIUS Act and pass legislation requiring all issuers and distributors of stablecoins to be FDIC-insured banks. Congress should also pass legislation requiring crypto derivatives to comply with the prudential rules established by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act for non-digital derivatives. Uninsured Nonbank Stablecoins Are Highly Vulnerable to Investor Runs, Which the GENIUS Act Will ot prevent A stablecoin is a crypto-asset whose issuer represents that the stablecoin’s value will maintain parity with a designated fiat currency or some other referenced asset or group of assets. About 98% of global stablecoins are linked (“pegged”) to the U.S. dollar. Dollar-linked stablecoins are functionally equivalent to bank deposits because their issuers represent that their stablecoins will be redeemed or transferred to third parties, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, on their holders’ demand or within a specified time. The global stablecoin market is highly concentrated. Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC account for over 80% of the $300 billion market capitalization of all global stablecoins. Stablecoins are primarily used as payment instruments for speculating in crypto-assets with fluctuating values, with about 90% of stablecoin payments being linked to crypto trades. Stablecoins are also widely used for conducting illicit transactions. In 2023, stablecoins were used as payment instruments for 60% of unlawful cryptocurrency transactions (including crypto scams, ransomware, evasion of capital controls, money laundering, and tax evasion) and 80% of all cryptocurrency transactions conducted by sanctioned regimes and terrorist groups. Dollar-linked stablecoins are used to a limited extent for cross-border remittances and other types of conventional payments, especially in developing countries with high inflation rates, unstable currencies, and unreliable banking and payment systems. In those countries, dollar-linked stablecoins provide a more stable form of currency, a more secure form of payment, and a hedge against inflation. At present, however, only 6% of stablecoin transactions involve cross-border remittances and other types of conventional payments. In addition, some governments view dollar-linked stablecoins as a threat to their monetary sovereignty and are considering measures to ban or limit the use of dollar-linked stablecoins in their countries. Despite the promises made by stablecoin issuers, stablecoins have proven to be anything but stable. More than 20 stablecoins collapsed between 2016 and 2022, and every leading global stablecoin – including USDT and USDC – lost its “peg” on multiple occasions between 2019 and 2023. Nonbank stablecoins are inherently unstable due to their primary use as “casino chips” for trading (gambling) in crypto-assets with fluctuating values. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other fluctuating-value crypto-assets have displayed huge price swings because they do not have any substantial underlying real-world assets, and they do not generate independent cash flows from activities beyond the speculative transactions occurring on their blockchains. Prices for crypto-assets with fluctuating values have experienced pronounced boom-and-bust cycles, including the crypto boom of 2020-21, the “crypto winter” of 2021-22, a slow recovery during 2022-23, and a second crypto boom that began in 2024, interrupted by a brief downturn during the first quarter of 2025. When values for crypto-assets fall significantly, highly-leveraged investors must liquidate their crypto holdings (including stablecoins) to meet margin calls and other debt obligations. The global market value of outstanding stablecoins dropped from $180 billion to $130 billion during the “crypto winter” of 2021-22, when the price of Bitcoin and the total market capitalization of all crypto-assets dropped by 70%. When large numbers of investors are suddenly obliged to liquidate their stablecoins, they must rely on the ability of stablecoin issuers and stablecoin exchanges to redeem stablecoins quickly at the “pegged” value of $1 per coin. The GENIUS Act permits nonbank stablecoin issuers to hold all or most of their reserves in uninsured financial instruments, such as uninsured bank deposits, money market funds (MMFs), and repurchase agreements (repos). Those uninsured reserves make nonbank stablecoin issuers vulnerable to serious disruptions in traditional financial markets. When Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) failed during the regional banking crisis of 2023, SVB’s largest uninsured depositor turned out to be Circle, which held $3.3 billion (8%) of USDC’s reserves at SVB. USDC broke its $1 “peg” after SVB failed, and its value fell to $0.87. USDC’s stablecoin holders launched a major run, and Circle was forced to liquidate $8 billion of its assets to satisfy redemption demands. USDC avoided a complete collapse – which could have caused a systemic meltdown in crypto markets – only after federal regulators invoked the systemic risk exception in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and bailed out Circle and SVB’s other uninsured depositors. The federal government’s rescue of Circle represented the first government bailout of uninsured nonbank stablecoins. As SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw observed in April 2005, “there is always a risk, particularly in times of market stress or if the price of a stablecoin drops, of a ‘run’ scenario” where crypto exchanges and stablecoin issuers “cannot honor all redemption requests in real time,” triggering a “self-reinforcing cycle of redemptions and fire sales of reserve assets.” The runs that have already occurred on nonbank stablecoins resemble the runs on uninsured deposits, MMFs, repos, and other uninsured, short-term financial claims that have taken place during U.S. financial crises stretching from the nineteenth century through 2023. The federal government rescued uninsured depositors in 1980-92, 2008-09, and 2023 to prevent banking and financial crises from becoming full-blown economic depressions. For similar reasons, the federal government protected investors in MMFs and other uninsured short-term financial instruments (such as commercial paper and repos) during the global financial crisis of 2008-09 and the pandemic financial crisis of 2020-21. The foregoing crises demonstrate that uninsured nonbank stablecoins, like other uninsured, short-term financial claims, are highly vulnerable to investor runs whenever there are substantial doubts about the ability of obligors to repay those financial claims in a timely manner. The GENIUS Act ignores the lessons of history because (1) it establishes a very weak and woefully inadequate regulatory regime for stablecoins, (2) it fails to provide a federally-supervised insurance fund or a federally-authorized lender of last resort to ensure the timely repayment of stablecoins, and (3) its only mechanism for dealing with defaults by stablecoin issuers is a deeply flawed bankruptcy regime, which will encourage stablecoin holders to run at the first sign of trouble. The GENIUS Act Will Not Improve Our Payments System or Increase Financial Inclusion Crypto advocates claim that uninsured nonbank stablecoins will greatly improve the U.S. payments system and increase financial inclusion. In fact, nonbank stablecoins operating on permissionless public blockchains do not offer a viable technology for providing fast, reliable, and cost-effective general-purpose payments or other large-volume financial services. Permissionless public blockchains suffer from two major problems – lack of scalability (the inability to process large numbers of transactions quickly) and immutability (the inability to correct mistaken, fraudulent, and unauthorized transactions). Those two problems – which arise out of the basic tenets of public blockchains – prevent public blockchains from providing a feasible technology for high-volume financial services. To mitigate the scalability problem, public blockchains have used “Layer 2” strategies such as sidechains and off-chain processing. “Layer 2” strategies delegate responsibility for processing and validating transactions to designated groups, which transmit the results of their work to the public blockchain. Such delegations of responsibility to trusted parties cause public blockchains to resemble permissioned distributed ledgers, which are administered by banks, broker-dealers, clearing facilities, and other traditional financial institutions. When public blockchains change their operations to function like permissioned ledgers, they effectively become financial intermediaries, and there is no longer any possible justification for regulating them differently from traditional financial intermediaries. As SEC Commissioner Crenshaw pointed out in January 2024, “If [public blockchain] technology is so revolutionary, why do so many of its uses seem to revolve around recreating the existing financial system, except with less regulation, more opacity, fewer investor protections, and more risk?” In addition to their unsuitability for general-purpose payments, nonbank stablecoins have not shown any ability to increase financial inclusion. Stablecoin holders must open bank accounts to convert their fiat currency into stablecoins, and to convert their stablecoins back into fiat currency. Stablecoin holders must also have internet access and financial sophistication, which many “unbanked” households lack. The crypto industry’s past dealings with underserved communities have included widespread predatory practices, including fraudulent marketing of high-risk crypto-assetsand “crypto ATMs” that charge high fees and are widely used to promote crypto scams. If Congress truly wants to promote a faster, cheaper, and more inclusive payments system, Congress should pass legislation that would (i) support tokenization of deposits on permissioned distributed ledgers administered by FDIC-insured banks, (ii) encourage faster implementation of real-time settlement services for bank payments, and (iii) require FDIC-insured banks to provide low-cost “Bank On” deposit accounts with payment services to lower-income individuals and families who satisfy minimum qualifications for lawful status and financial responsibility. Such legislation would promote much-needed improvements in our payments system and increase financial inclusion without undermining the integrity and effectiveness of our federally-insured banking system. The GENIUS Act Creates a “Shadow Banking 2.0” Crypto Regime and Unleashes Crypto Derivatives That Will Inflate a “Subprime 2.0” Crypto Bubble. The GENIUS Act allows uninsured nonbank stablecoins to become a dangerous new form of “shadow deposits” comparable to MMFs, thereby creating a dangerous “Shadow Banking 2.0” crypto regime. Nonbank stablecoin issuers will siphon away large amounts of deposits from FDIC-insured banks because the GENIUS Act permits affiliates of stablecoin issuers and crypto exchanges to pay “rewards” on stablecoins. The loss of bank deposits will severely impair the ability of community and regional banks to provide much-needed loans to consumers and Main Street businesses. Nonbank stablecoin issuers cannot replace those lost loans because they must invest virtually all their assets in designated short-term financial instruments held as reserves. The GENIUS Act also permits nonbank stablecoin issuers to sell to the public a potentially unlimited range of crypto derivatives and other crypto investments that are approved by federal and state regulators as being “incidental” to the activities of crypto asset service providers. Crypto derivatives – including futures, options, and swaps – account for about three-quarters of all crypto trading activity, and most crypto derivatives trades occur on unregulated foreign exchanges. Perpetual crypto futures contracts enable investors to make highly-leveraged, long-term bets on movements in crypto prices without owning the underlying crypto-assets. In addition, SEC has approved crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the value of both individual and multiple crypto-assets. Crypto ETFs are rapidly proliferating, as are “crypto treasury companies” that invest in crypto-assets. The explosion of high-risk crypto derivatives and other risky crypto investments is inflating a “Subprime 2.0” crypto bubble by generating multiple, highly-leveraged bets on extremely volatile crypto-assets that do not have any underlying tangible assets or independent cash flows. The rapidly growing pile of speculative bets on crypto-assets resembles the toxic pyramid of bets on subprime mortgages, which financial giants created during the “Subprime 1.0” credit boom of the 2000s by issuing trillions of dollars of derivatives whose values depended on the performance of subprime mortgages. The collapse of the “Subprime 1.0” credit boom in 2007 unleashed a global financial crisis. The bursting of the speculative crypto bubble produced by “Shadow Banking 2.0” and “Subprime 2.0” will almost certainly cause a similar crash, with potentially devastating spillover effects on our financial system and economy. Federal agencies will be very hard-pressed to contain such a crash with bailouts comparable to those of 2008-09 and 2020-21. Given the federal government’s huge debt burden, implementing such bailouts would be likely to trigger a crisis in the Treasury bond market as well as a significant depreciation of the U.S. dollar. The GENIUS Act Opens the Door for Big Tech firms and Other Commercial Enterprises to Conduct a Crypto Banking Business, Magnifying the Risks of the Current Crypto Bubble Under the GENIUS Act, Big Tech firms and other commercial enterprises can acquire nonbank stablecoin issuers and use those issuers’ funds and services to establish crypto-based financial empires. Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Meta (Facebook), Walmart, and X are already developing plans to offer stablecoins. The GENIUS Act allows privately-held technology firms, like Elon Musk’s X, to acquire nonbank stablecoin issuers. The statute also permits the “Stablecoin Certification Review Committee,” chaired by Treasury Secretary Bessent, to authorize publicly-traded Big Tech firms and other commercial enterprises to acquire nonbank stablecoin issuers. The GENIUS Act undermines our nation’s long-established policy of separating banking and commerce and creates enormous risks for consumers and Main Street businesses. Allowing Big Tech firms to issue and distribute stablecoins will give technology giants access to their customers’ private financial data, including detailed information about their financial assets and spending patterns. That access will increase exponentially the ability of Big Tech firms to surveil, sell, and monetize their customers’ private information. Acquisitions of stablecoin issuers by Big Tech firms and other commercial enterprises will create a new category of “too-big-to-fail” financial giants. Those acquisitions will also greatly increase the likelihood that future crypto crashes will spread across the entire span of our economy, inflicting catastrophic losses on our financial system, economy, and society. Conclusion The GENIUS Act is a disastrous law that poses grave and unacceptable threats to our financial and economic future. Congress must remove those threats by (1) repealing the GENIUS Act and passing legislation that requires all stablecoin providers to be FDIC-insured banks, and (2) adopting legislation that requires all crypto derivatives to comply with the rules governing non-digital derivatives under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. Why make those FDIC insured, but not Money Market Funds? MMF are securities like mutual funds and are protected to some degree by the SIPC. “To some degree”…I know They brought up the all important FDIC for this BS. Why not FDIC insurance for money market funds, which are often offered by FDIC insured banks? The article isn’t asking for stablecoin and crypto to be protected by SIPC “to some degree” or something like SIPC. Why would they get the special FDIC treatment and not money market funds? Did you miss that money market funds ARE now insured up to $250,000 like bank deposits? I didn’t see that dollar amount in the article. It mentioned some times of not letting MMFs go bust, but didn’t specify that it was an FDIC gaurantee. Please be careful of the terminology: Money Market Deposit Accounts are insured to the usual FDIC levels, when offered through a bank – the MMDA just another deposit account. A Money Market *fund*, is a security and cannot be offered through a bank (though it can be sold by a bank’s broker-dealer subsidiary, but is held in a brokerage account) and is not insured under FDIC rules — depending on how it’s held, it would be insured against failure of the broker-dealer by SIPC insurance. The article and underlying articles imply that it’s going to be ok for a bank to issue *uninsured* stablecoins, and rightly points out the history lessons that are being ignored. I haven’t seen anything that implies that the FDIC is going to expand deposit insurance to stablecoin amounts held in a bank account. (Though bailouts of uninsured holdings at banks as a result of bank failure certainly seems to be the historical norm.) https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/faq ” A Money Market *fund*, is a security and cannot be offered through a bank (though it can be sold by a bank’s broker-dealer subsidiary, but is held in a brokerage account) and is not insured under FDIC rules —” “The article and underlying articles imply that it’s going to be ok for a bank to issue *uninsured* stablecoins” The article is proposing legislation be passed which “requires all stablecoin providers to be FDIC-insured banks.” It’s not saying a subsidiary…as you say about money market funds. Connecting to this question, I understand that imposing regulations upon stablecoin operators similar to those applying on banks (including reserves, prudential management, etc) would help reduce the risk and quash many of the worst and riskiest practices, but (perhaps a stupid question) why on its own would a FDIC insurance prevent runs on stablecoins? Isn’t FDIC insurance capped? And by the way: “require FDIC-insured banks to provide low-cost “Bank On” deposit accounts with payment services to lower-income individuals and families who satisfy minimum qualifications for lawful status and financial responsibility.” Oh no, again a proposal that requires proving that one meets the “minimum qualifications”. What about a low-cost “Bank On” deposit account with payment services for everybody, no qualifications asked, no bureaucratic applications, no availability depending from one year to another on the vagaries of life? It’s supposed to be capped, but look what happened with the SVB and other bailouts a couple of years ago. If SICP “to some degree” or something like that is good enough for other risky assets, why isn’t that brought up as an option? FDIC protect crypto and not money market funds? There’s a reason I assume for not doing it for money market funds. But that is being skipped over in the request to do it for crypto. “Nonbank stablecoins are inherently unstable due to their primary use as “casino chips” for trading (gambling) in crypto-assets with fluctuating values. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other fluctuating-value crypto-assets have displayed huge price swings because they do not have any substantial underlying real-world assets, and they do not generate independent cash flows from activities beyond the speculative transactions occurring on their blockchains. Prices for crypto-assets with fluctuating values have experienced pronounced boom-and-bust cycles, including the crypto boom of 2020-21, the “crypto winter” of 2021-22, a slow recovery during 2022-23, and a second crypto boom that began in 2024, interrupted by a brief downturn during the first quarter of 2025. When values for crypto-assets fall significantly, highly-leveraged investors must liquidate their crypto holdings (including stablecoins) to meet margin calls and other debt obligations…” And why not make stock portfolios FDIC insured? FDIC was brought up specifically. The FDIC inspects bank portfolios and can assure compliance with regs, specifically having full backing of the stablecoins. They are also talking about having losses covered. Or are they not? I would rather have them outlawed but that horse has left the barn and is in the next county. We are now forced to look at what options are least bad. Losses for a stablecoin would be the same as “breaking the buck” in a money market fund, as in would imply the failure/insolvency of the fund. I agree with most of the points except classifying all crypto assets as risky. Spot crypto ETFs that actually hold the underlying asset without use of risky futures and other derivatives are relatively safe. So is holding a deflationary asset like Bitcoin, the digital equivalent of gold. It derives its value from the network of participants, much like gold. There’s no inherent industrial or practical use for it other than all participants agreeing to use it as a store of value. BlackRock does not describe its Bitcoin ETF as a spot EFT on its site as in as part of its official disclosures. So I am not sure your claims about “spot EFT” are as encompassing as you imply: https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/products/333011/ishares-bitcoin-trust The language merely says “get exposure” which is way short of proportional to any underlying coins held. All ETFs also show drift from NAV since they trade on market prices and not on NAV like mutual funds. The entire “stablecoin” (which, with apologies to Voltaire, are neither stable nor coins) industry reminds of little more than 19th century “wildcat banking” with some sparkly “tech” sprinkled on top to gull the rubes. So it goes … Various players are getting a pass for this nonsense (see pic below)…so these types will continue to create messes that others have to clean up: “more and more like home mortgage securitization at the peak of the housing bubble with its overlapping series of capital conveyor belts.” pic.twitter.com/ar9NiVUaXp I don’t see it as all that far-fetched that we could have a AI/stock market collapse in combination with a crypto and stable coin panic. Poor Trump-ian impulse control on the trade and/or geopolitical front would then be the icing on the gravy, generating simultaneous and intertwined economic, financial and political crises… No wonder that gold, the ultimate Fear-O-Meter, is exploding in price. In the words of the immortal Lou Gorman: “The sun will rise, the sun will set, and I will have lunch.” In Water Cooler (remember that?) Lambert used to link to Greed and Fear index. I really don’t understand why that, and e.g., the VIX (also on that page) seem so unconcerned right now, apart from a spike earlier this year… Between inflation (Best foods mayo $12 Qt) and uncertainty I expect this Xmas to be a disaster for retailers, those 750,000 Federal workers who have just been told they might not get their back pay are unlikely to splurge on Xmas. Or spend $ on anything that isn’t a necessity. One of the things I learned selling Real Estate was that uncertainty killed markets, prices and interest rates had an important impact, however it was uncertainty that mattered most. And not by a small amount. Its pretty surreal watching it all play out-having no dog in the fight aside from the possibility that we’ll pull a circa 1990 move by take your pick of South American countries that all thought by renaming their national currency, everything would be jake. That’s what is potentially going down, our national currency backed by bright and shiny new bupkis. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Musk’s Tesla package pays him billions even if he misses ‘Mars-shot’ goals

When Tesla’s board of directors offered Elon Musk the biggest executive pay package in corporate history in September, it reassured investors that he would have to achieve the equivalent of “Mars-shot milestones” to earn $878 billion in Tesla stock over 10 years. The board’s proposal said Musk would have to “completely transform Tesla and society as we know it” in robotics and autonomous driving as well as stock value and profits. Conversely, Musk would get “zero” unless he meets those “incredibly ambitious” goals. Yet Musk could reap tens of billions of dollars without meeting most of those targets, according to a Reuters analysis of his performance goals and more than a dozen experts in executive pay, company valuations, robotics and automotive trends including autonomous driving. He could collect more than $50 billion by hitting a handful of the board’s easier goals that won’t necessarily revolutionize Tesla’s products or business, the Reuters review found. Even hitting just two of the easiest targets, along with modest stock growth, would net Musk $26 billion, more than the lifetime pay of the next eight best-paid CEOs combined, a group that includes Meta Platforms’ Mark Zuckerberg, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, Apple’s Tim Cook, and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, according to an analysis for Reuters by research firm Equilar. Musk’s vehicle sales goals are exceptionally easy to achieve, according to four automotive experts. If Musk sells 1.2 million cars a year over the next decade, on average, he earns $8.2 billion in stock if Tesla’s market value grows from $1.4 trillion today to $2 trillion in 2035, well under long-term market-average growth. That’s a half-million fewer cars per year than Tesla sold in 2024. On Tuesday, Tesla unveiled lower-cost versions of its best-selling Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan to reverse falling sales. Three other product-development goals are written in vague language that could provide Musk hefty payouts without significantly boosting profit, according to six robotics or autonomous-driving industry experts who reviewed Musk’s goals for Reuters. Tesla and Musk did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, a spokesperson for the Tesla board said: “The proposed pay package is actually worth zero to our CEO unless and until the shareholders see the value of the company nearly double and an operational milestone is met.” The board’s pay proposal requires Musk to remain a Tesla executive for at least seven-and-a-half years to collect any stock compensation. Musk, however, would get the voting rights associated with the share awards as soon as he earns them. Musk said last month on his social media platform X that the package is “not about ‘compensation,’ but about me having enough influence over Tesla to ensure safety if we build millions of robots.” In its proposal, the board said Musk is “motivated by more than just conventional forms of compensation.” Each goal grants Musk 1% of Tesla stock if he also reaches valuation milestones between $2 trillion and $8.5 trillion. One goal requires 10 million subscriptions to Tesla’s “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) software, which can’t currently drive itself without human intervention. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Thursday it is opening an investigation into 2.88 million FSD-equipped Tesla vehicles over more than 50 reports of traffic-safety violations and a series of crashes. Musk’s performance goal contains no requirement that Tesla make FSD fully autonomous, instead requiring only an “advanced driving system.” That’s a “made-up term” with no industry-standard definition, said William Widen, a University of Miami law professor specializing in autonomous driving. Autonomous-driving experts say the subscription target might be easily met by dropping the price, currently $8,000 upfront or $99 a month. Tesla’s leading electric-vehicle rival, China’s BYD, already offers a similar system for free. “If I were Musk’s personal employment lawyer, I would like these definitions,” said Matthew Wansley, a professor at New York’s Cardozo School of Law who focuses on autonomous driving. Another goal requires one million robotaxis in commercial operation and specifies cars “without a human driver in the vehicle.” That’s a potentially more restrictive definition but four autonomous-vehicle experts said it could be interpreted to allow for humans controlling vehicles remotely or from the passenger seat – as Tesla does now in its first small-scale robotaxi test in Austin, Texas. Musk’s employment deal also sets a target of one million robots, an apparent reference to the Optimus humanoid robots Musk has long promised. But the goal doesn’t specify “humanoid” and could be interpreted broadly, two robotics-industry experts said. It defines “bot” as “any robot or other physical product with mobility using artificial intelligence.” “It’s a totally vague formulation,” said Christian Rokseth, an analyst with market research firm Humanoid.guide specializing in robotics and artificial intelligence. Investors, he said, are expecting a humanoid robot. Hitting any two product goals in a decade, along with a $2.5 trillion valuation, pays Musk $26.4 billion in stock. Hitting three targets and a $3 trillion valuation pays him $54.6 billion. That means Musk could earn these amounts without delivering driverless Teslas, the signature product he’s promised for a decade. Gene Munster, managing partner at Tesla investor Deepwater Asset Management, said that despite the loose language in his performance agreement, investors would ultimately hold him accountable for delivering transformational products. “If people start smelling there’s something goofy here, he’s in trouble,” Munster said. In its pay proposal, Tesla’s board declared Musk the only person capable of transforming Tesla into an artificial-intelligence juggernaut. The board added that Musk, during negotiations, raised the prospect of “prioritizing other ventures” if he and the board couldn’t agree on compensation. Corporate governance experts said the board is taking a huge risk by so explicitly staking its future on one leader. Wei Jiang, vice dean at Emory University’s business school, said Tesla’s board has granted Musk a “monopoly” on Tesla’s top job. Good corporate governance, she said, requires embracing a “competitive and fluid market for CEOs.” Musk’s hardest performance targets are likely those involving profit, a measure with no room for interpretation. The directors set eight profit goals between $50 billion and $400 billion in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, compared to Tesla’s 2024 earnings of $16.6 billion. Tesla’s EV business, which accounts for almost all its revenue, is deteriorating with aging models facing fierce competition. Its only newer model, the Cybertruck, has flopped. The way Musk’s compensation is structured, however, allows for massive payouts without hitting any profit target. Every goal combined with a market-value increase offers the same 1% stock payout. So Musk gets the same pay for meeting the relatively easy vehicle sales and FSD-subscription goals, for instance, as he would for boosting earnings five-fold to $80 billion. The board’s valuation goals may prove far easier than its profit targets. Tesla’s value could hit $2 trillion, for instance, if shares grow a modest 6.4% annually over the decade following the board’s Sept. 3 pay-package approval. That’s slower growth than the S&P 500’s 8.5% annual average over the past 30 years and less than half the Nasdaq’s 13.2% average. Seth Goldstein, a Morningstar analyst who tracks Tesla, said its valuation could easily hit $3 trillion or more over a decade with market-average performance. He pointed out, however, that Tesla’s value is already largely based on “future products that don’t exist today.” For Musk to claim the biggest payouts offered by Tesla’s board, Goldstein said, “we’re going to start having to see real products.” Kevin Murphy, a University of Southern California finance professor and an expert witness for Tesla in defending Musk’s 2018 pay package, acknowledged that the vehicle sales and $2 trillion valuation goals aren’t “much of a stretch” but simply reaching those won’t appease shareholders. Neither will the “handful of billions” for lower-rung goals matter much to Musk, who cares more about historic technological achievements, Murphy said. Shareholders, he said, have focused on the hardest goals and biggest payouts because they believe Musk – and only Musk – can hit them. “Is it worth it?” Murphy said. “Shareholders seem to think so.” Between 2016-17 and 2020-21, the drug regulator in Tamil Nadu consistently fell short of its targets, with inspectors conducting about 61% of scheduled drug inspections and collecting roughly 49% of the samples required for quality testing.

Wall Street is hedging its bets. While the S&P 500, the world’s most followed stock market index, keeps hitting record highs every other day amid a three-year bull run, gold, which usually moves in the opposite direction to shares, has been on a tear of its own. The price of the safe-haven asset has jumped more than 50 per cent so far this year to breach $4,000 (€3,443) an ounce for the first time. Reasons for the gold rush abound. Many market strategists say the precious metal is being used as a hedge against economic uncertainty caused by Trump administration tariffs. Some point to a fall this year in the value of the dollar, the currency in which gold is priced. And others say gold is a safe bet in case the artificial intelligence (AI) boom that has been fuelling the stock market starts to fizzle out. But, for Ron O’Hanley, chairman and chief executive of State Street – a leading administrator to the global investment management industry and one of the biggest asset managers in its own right – the reason for the anomaly may be more simple. [ ‘Gold-plated Fomo’ powers bullion’s record-breaking rallyOpens in new window ] “In some ways, gold is an indicator of what investors’ beliefs are about long-term inflation prospects,” O’Hanley says, speaking to The Irish Times in Dublin this week. There are good reasons to be concerned about rising inflation over time. “If you look at government debt levels, there’s been a fundamental change if you think about the ’08 period to where we are now,” he says. “The pandemic proved quite costly in the taking on of government debt.” Global government debt surged from 58 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2007 to 93 per cent last year, or almost $100 trillion, driven by the borrowings to support businesses and households during Covid lockdowns, according to the International Monetary Fund. Some investors believe central banks may, eventually, tolerate higher inflation to reduce the real burden of public debt. So, why is the equity market continuing to rise? “In aggregate, consumer debt levels are in pretty good shape relative to where they were in the past. Corporate debt levels are also in pretty good shape,” says O’Hanley. “That is a good signal to the equity market.” The impact of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks that have driven the S&P 500 in recent years – Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla – is now starting to broaden to other companies, he says. Official interest rates are continuing to decline. Meanwhile, corporate earnings are, for the time being at least, also holding up well – with the consensus forecast among analysts pointing to 10 per cent earnings per share growth this year in the US – even as many industries are absorbing much of the impact of tariffs, rather than passing them on to customers. A survey published by KPMG last week found that just a fifth of US businesses have passed on over half of new tariff expenses. O’Hanley, whose group has $49 trillion of assets under custody and administration (almost the equivalent of the US and EU economies combined, measured by GDP), is on the fence – publicly at least – on the long-term effects of US president Donald Trump’s protectionist trade policies. “That’s the $64,000 question that everybody’s asking. And probably the entity that is asking it the most is the Federal Reserve. There is a school of thought that the tariffs are a one-time price reset and they shouldn’t actually reset inflation expectations. Others say this has a rolling impact that will be cumulative – and in a way that we just don’t know.” The biggest challenge is ongoing uncertainty, as many tariffs are still not finalised, he says, more than six months after Trump’s Liberation Day speech. The broader question is the future of globalisation. “Whether you call it deglobalisation or a reordering of globalisation, we’re going to see change – and national interests become much more prominent,” he says. “We’re in a period of adjustment. And the biggest challenge to investors and companies is that it’s very hard to make a decision that has long-term implications when you’ve got this kind of uncertainty.” It must be disorienting to ponder for someone whose career began at the dawn of the era of hyperglobalisation. Following the completion of a master’s in business administration (MBA) at Harvard Business School in 1986, Hanley joined management consultancy McKinsey, where he would end up as a partner and head of the firm’s investment management practice worldwide. [ ‘You’d have to have been a turkey not to have made money in venture capital in 1997’Opens in new window ] He subsequently joined Mellon Financial Corporation in 1997 and went on, following the group’s 2007 merger with Bank of New York, to serve as the wider BNY Mellon group’s asset management arm. Hanley also spent a four-year stint in a senior role at Fidelity Investments before joining State Street in 2015 as head of the investment management arm. State Street traces its roots back to 1792 as Union Bank in Boston. Fifty years ago it shifted its focus from commercial banking to the plumbing work that takes place after shares and bonds are traded – like clearing, settlement and custody – as well as asset management. State Street set up an Irish operation in 1996 and has since become one of the largest international financial services employers in the State, employing about 2,300 people in offices in Dublin, Kilkenny, Naas, Co Kildare, and Drogheda, Co Louth. Almost a decade and a half ago, the investment arm bought Bank of Ireland Asset Management (BIAM), once the crown jewel of the Irish bank. BIAM had €26 billion of assets under management (AUM) at the time. The US group had $49 trillion of assets under custody and administration as of the end of June. Its asset management arm, rebranded as State Street Investment Management this year, had $5.12 trillion of AUM. While O’Hanley’s appointment as incoming CEO of State Street in November 2017 marked the culmination of his career, a report in The Boston Globe the next day drew attention to a less flattering episode from his distant past. It’s interesting to see all the excitement in AI as if it was invented in 2023 ... we – and others – have been on this AI journey for many, many years It reported that he withdrew from Vanderbilt University Law School in 1983 after admitting to plagiarism as editor-in-chief of the Vanderbilt Law Review. A day after the report, he issued an email to staff, acknowledging that “as a student I made a big mistake”. State Street stood by O’Hanley. A spokeswoman said at the time that he had fully disclosed the matter and the organisation supported him “unequivocally”. His “track record as a corporate leader and his achievements both at State Street and in his previous roles speak for themselves”, she added. Under O’Hanley’s tenure as CEO, which officially began in January 2019, the group’s assets under custody and administration have jumped 55 per cent, while assets under management have more than doubled. While the softly-spoken executive is a lower-profile figure than many other bosses of top US financial institutions – such as JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon, Larry Fink of BlackRock or Jane Fraser at Citigroup – he is well regarded in the asset management and administration world. Last year, Global Custodian, the go-to publication for the industry, gave him a lifetime achievement award. The past three years have seen State Street take out $1.3 billion of running expenses, driven by the use of AI to do more mundane tasks normally carried out by entry-level workers, O’Hanley told a conference in June. He said the underlying global headcount fell by 4,000 last year – even as the headline figure jumped 13 per cent to 53,000 as it consolidated an Indian joint venture into the group. “It’s interesting to see all the excitement in AI as if it was invented in 2023,” he says now. “But we – and others – have been on this AI journey for many, many years.” [ AI’s replacement of humans in HR is emblematic of what could happen across the workplaceOpens in new window ] Machine learning has long been used for one of the most important daily tasks of State Street: calculating the net asset value (NAV) of tens of thousands of funds. “Fifteen or 20 years ago, markets would close and a flurry of activity would start to work out what happened in a fund that day – the buys, the sells, the corporate actions, the dividends paid and received – to come up with a net asset value. It typically took an hour and a half to produce and send on to clients. “What’s happening now, with machine learning, is that the NAV is being calculated transaction by transaction every day. That was, if you will, a prior generation of AI.” State Street is currently teaming up its software engineers with what he calls “AI buddies”. And it is encouraging employees to continually think differently about how AI can be used at work. “I’m often amazed at some of the ideas that come up. Some you might think of as trite, but they’re actually changing work in a fundamental way. The housing crisis isn’t unique to Ireland. Our home city of Boston is equally challenged when it comes to housing. It’s a global problem “For example, take the end of a financial period. Again, that’s a time when a lot of people spring into action. All that work has now shortened. Is it reducing the number of people? Not really. But time that was spent on identifying ‘what happened’ is collapsing. That’s created more time for the ‘so what’ of what’s happened – the analysis around it.” Most importantly, it’s left time to consider the ‘now what?’ – what are we going to do next?” he says. “AI will change the way we work. But, like a lot of change, it will take time, and then it will go fast.” Will AI lead to dystopian scenario of the robots taking over white-collar jobs, or create a future where people are free to enjoy greater leisure and personal fulfilment? “I think neither is going to happen. For the most part, it will change the nature of work for the positive,” he says. “It’ll put new requirements on employees. It will also have implications for the education system. We need to move away from a way of thinking, where people go, ‘I know exactly what my child needs. They need to go to coding camp and be prepared to be an electrical engineer.’ In future, you need to be a problem solver and you need to be a lifelong learner.” O’Hanley (68) says he spends about 60 per cent of his working life away from Boston. He has been in Ireland this week for a series of meetings and to speak at a convention in Dublin on Thursday. He has Irish roots on both sides of his family tree. Forebears of his mother, whose family name was Fagan, moved to the US in the 18th century. “The O’Hanley’s were famine emigrants from Roscommon in the late 1840s,” he says. “They took the classic journey, with a couple of generations in Canada before making their way down to the Boston-Rhode Island area.” O’Hanley also speaks about State Street’s commitment to regional Irish towns and cities, even as rival BNY Mellon recently decided to close its offices in Wexford and Cork – affecting hundreds of jobs – to improve “operational efficiency”. Dublin’s position at the epicentre of a national housing crisis makes it more important to spread the company’s Irish operations to attract and keep “talent”, O’Hanley says. [ Dublin is becoming a place of extremes, home to only the very richest and the poorestOpens in new window ] “The housing crisis isn’t unique to Ireland. Our home city of Boston is equally challenged when it comes to housing. It’s a global problem.” The CEO says he’s “actually quite encouraged” by Government efforts to boost housing supply. While economists say the Government faces major challenges meeting its target of delivering 300,000 new homes by 2030, home builders have concluded that Budget 2026 measures aimed at rebooting apartment building – together with new apartment construction guidelines unveiled during the summer – have moved the dial significantly and will help narrow the viability gap for apartment construction. “But, like everybody else,” O’Hanley says, “we’d like to see more, faster.” Name: Ron O’Hanley.

PHOTO ILLUSTRATION: PIXABAY Published Oct 10, 2025, 11:30 AM Updated Oct 10, 2025, 12:59 PM NEW YORK – In June, Mr Elon Musk predicted that artificial intelligence (AI) would become smarter than any human by the end of 2026. In July, OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman said his company’s product “is going to reshape the course of human history”. Mr Mark Zuckerberg has imagined creating “a personal superintelligence that helps you achieve your goals, create what you want to see in the world”. The CEOs are backing up their words with dollars. Five of the biggest tech companies are together spending an estimated US$371 billion (S$482 billion) in 2025 on the massive data centres necessary to train and run complex AI models. That figure is expected to increase in the years to come: McKinsey & Co projects that data centres will require US$5.2 trillion in spending by 2030 to keep up with demand for AI. All that spending raises the question: Will AI ever produce enough revenue to justify the price? The maths is daunting. In 2025, AI technology is expected to generate US$60 billion in revenue, according to one estimate by writers Azeem Azhar and Nathan Warren of AI-focused newsletter Exponential View. That number will need to increase dramatically if tech companies want to recoup costs. In September, Bain & Co calculated that Big Tech would need US$2 trillion in additional annual revenue to pay for data centre expenditures by 2030 and projected a shortfall of US$800 billion a year even under ideal circumstances. If AI giants and their investors can’t make their money back, then we’re talking about a historically large case of overbuilding and overinvestment. There might even be a word for that. “I believe it’s a bubble,” says Mr Harris Kupperman, founder of Praetorian Capital Management, a self-described contrarian hedge fund with about US$300 million in assets under management. “Will there ever be a payback on this stuff? I think the answer is ‘highly unlikely’.” Covering the cost of just 2025’s build-out will require additional revenue of US$480 billion, according to Mr Kupperman’s calculations. Where that will come from is unclear, especially considering that for most users, ChatGPT is currently free. “If they charged you a couple dollars every time you queried ChatGPT, I don’t know if they’d have a market,” Mr Kupperman says. It doesn’t help that graphics processing units (GPUs) – the essential computer chips for AI that account for a significant chunk of data centre costs – depreciate quickly. In past bubbles, such as the railroad construction of the 19th century or the telecommunications build-out of the early 2000s, the overspending at least created lasting infrastructure. Even if people didn’t use the railroad tracks right away, they remained useful for decades, as was the fibre-optic cable laid in the 1990s. GPUs, in contrast, appear to have a shelf life of just a few years before they need to be reassigned to more basic AI tasks. The maths makes AI spending seem less like a flywheel than a hamster wheel. Then there are the bottlenecks, which could prevent many planned AI factories from reaching completion. While data centres typically take two to three years to build, hooking them up to an energy source can take up to eight years, according to Boston Consulting Group. So it will take that much longer for data centres to begin generating revenue. And that’s if the energy is available at all: A 2024 review by the Commonwealth of Virginia, the data centre capital of the world, concluded that meeting the unconstrained energy needs of this infrastructure would be “very difficult”, and even meeting half of that demand would be “difficult”. Sceptics also point to disappointing performance by the AI tools themselves. A much-cited study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab found that 95 per cent of AI projects piloted by businesses have produced no measurable return. McKinsey reported that almost eight in 10 companies that adopt generative AI see “no significant bottom-line impact”. OpenAI released GPT-5 in August to tepid reviews, raising questions about the industry’s assumption that more data is better when it comes to AI. Finally, observers concerned about an AI bubble point to the circularity of recent deals – for example, Nvidia is selling chips to OpenAI while also investing in it – that has echoes of the telecoms bubble. They also worry about the growing opacity of funding mechanisms. In August, Meta Platforms raised US$29 billion for data centres from private credit firms. Big start-ups such as OpenAI and CoreWeave have also leaned on private credit for data centre financing. These agreements often take the form of obscure special purpose vehicles, which keep the debt off the big companies’ balance sheets and make the health of the investments hard to track. There are also signs that the exposure of average investors to these risky bets is growing, as private credit firms raise money from insurance companies and real-estate-focused exchange-traded funds invest in data centres, according to investor and writer Paul Kedrosky. And of course anyone who owns shares in a mutual fund is most likely betting on data centres via Big Tech stocks. The AI bulls – which, judging by stock market trends, include most investors – aren’t too concerned. In their view, revenue from generative AI is growing and will continue to grow. And while the infrastructure build-out looks big, it’s not that big compared with certain past bubbles, write Mr Azhar and Mr Warren of Exponential View. As a proportion of gross domestic product, spending on railroads during that boom was four times greater than current spending on AI infrastructure. Most important, Big Tech companies have plenty of cash; they can afford to lose a few hundred billion dollars. Mr Altman and Mr Zuckerberg have both suggested they’re focused on the long game rather than immediate profits. The question is how long their investors will take the same view. The challenge of any bubble is not knowing if it will pop but when. Entrepreneurial studies clinical assistant professor Erik Gordon of the University of Michigan says the first signs of fading optimism are likely to appear in venture capital funding for AI start-ups. “You might see the size of funding rounds go down,” he says. Public stock prices would most likely follow. (For now, it’s still up, up, up.) Until then, the AI explosion is something of a Rorschach test: What you see depends on how you view AI’s prospects broadly. Haters have been calling the boom financially unsustainable for ages. Those who believe in the technology’s potential seem to have faith that it will still grow and improve fast enough to recoup costs – even if the traditional laws of the market suggest otherwise.

Title: Why The Bull Market Should Keep Going

ByLarry Light, Senior Contributor. Will the good times for stocks stay rolling? Likely, yes, in the face of some daunting obstacles. A year ago, this column predicted that stocks probably would continue their winning ways in 2025. Up to now, that upbeat prognosis has held true, with equities powering past a Washington-induced April chill. The U.S. is completing the third year of a bull run, with the S&P 500 climbing almost 90%. (FactSet Research dates the start of the bull market at Oct. 12, 2022.) Of course, no one knows whether some X factor will appear to halt positive market momentum and shove investments into a hole. Recall last April, when President Donald Trump first announced his planned tariffs—and investors freaked out. The heartening news is that stocks recovered their equilibrium from that presidential pronouncement and then some. This has been the story of 2025, and with luck stocks will keep up their welcome performance. Factors benefiting stocks include a relatively low inflation rate, a decent (if not roaring) economy and artificial intelligence’s popularity. The S&P 500 this year is up 14.5% through Thursday, having shaken off the April panic, as the tariffs thus far appear not to have harmed growth, or if so, just marginally. A poll of registered investment advisors (RIAs) this summer found cautious optimism, with almost two-thirds of respondents expecting the S&P to rise 6% to 9% over the ensuing 12 months. The poll, by advisory firm Security Benefit (with data from Greenwald Research), found scant RIA expectations for a near-term recession. “We’re in the middle innings of the bull market,” says Joseph Quinlan, head of CIO market strategy for Merrill and Bank of America, in an interview. He points to strong stock buybacks and high-income consumer spending as propellants for the equities surge. Indeed, stockholders have spent over $1 trillion on share repurchases over the past 12 months through September, per Morningstar, and consumer spending is healthy, although more so for wealthier Americans, a BofA study found. Certainly, some have worried about whether inflation will rise meaningfully, especially as the tariffs take hold. The Federal Reserve has an annual 2% target for inflation, but that has proven elusive. Thus far, the Consumer Price Index has stayed just below 3% annually (the next CPI release, covering September, is on Oct. 15, if the shutdown doesn’t thwart it). A survey by the New York Federal Reserve Bank showed that households believe inflation will tick up slightly above 3% over the next year, hardly a baleful scenario. Up ahead, macroeconomic conditions appear favorable, on balance. Macro, after all, typically drives the market. The Fed believes that gross domestic product will maintain a steady, modestly improving pace going forward, clocking a median annual increase of 1.6% this year, 1.8% in 2026 and 1.9% in 2027. You’d think that the U.S. government shutdown would kneecap stocks. But as Sam Stovall, CFRA’s chief investment strategist, points out in a research note, the market has tended to “drift higher” in previous Washington closures. The thinking apparently is that no lasting damage will occur and the stoppage will be temporary. To date, the market has largely shrugged off the shutdown: The S&P climbed 0.58% on Wednesday and Thursday closed down 0.34%. Overall, since the shutdown started, the index has inched up 0.62%. One big reason for optimism about the market: Lower interest rates soon are a strong possibility. Recently released minutes of the Federal Reserve’s policymaking board in mid-September indicated that the Fed is tilted toward two more cuts this year, one-quarter percentage point each. In that same meeting, the central bank moved to slice its benchmark rate by a quarter-point, to a 4.0% to 4.25% range, its first reduction of 2025. The most-discussed catalyst behind much of the market growth lately is artificial intelligence. The widespread fascination with AI’s promise has been stoked by a massive buildout of data centers. Meta Platforms and Oracle are among the tech giants pouring vast sums into this arena. The gargantuan capital spending has doubled GDP this year, by some estimates. Meta’s stock is up 25% in 2025 and Oracle’s 79%. A large question looms about whether all these outlays will pay off, and skeptics declare that the enthusiasm is reminiscent of the 1990s dot-com boom, which ended badly. Profits from AI are hard to find, as of yet. Still, the craze over the dot-com industry was not wrong, just early. Since that bust, a third of a century ago, the Web has gone on to dominate the world’s culture and commerce. Long-term investors should take heed. In the meantime, stocks should remain rewarding for investors. Nobody knows for how long, but the immediate future looks pretty good.

More Info As we approach the end of the 2025 financial year, the U.S. stock market continues its defiant rally, shrugging off concerns about job losses, a partial government shutdown, and geopolitical instability. While the S&P 500 has surged with a roughly 14.2% year-to-date (YTD) gain, fueled largely by the relentless AI-driven investment boom—a phenomenon reshaping capital flows from semiconductors to energy infrastructure—the overall Energy sector is lagging badly. With a mere 4.5% YTD gain, it holds the third-lowest spot among major sectors, as oil and gas producers contend with softer commodity prices, the unwinding of OPEC+ cuts, rising costs, and elevated tariffs. Yet, beneath the surface of this underperforming sector, a significant transformation is taking hold.... A rebound in clean energy has seen the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) rise nearly 40 % this year, with demand tied to AI data centers and electrification is driving new investing patterns. Solar stocks are also benefiting, bolstered by policy support and tax incentives preserved (in part) under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). One recent Oilprice article warns that OBBBA “gutted key tax incentives for clean energy projects” and warns the bill’s impact on solar could worsen over time. The U.S. Senate’s July passage of OBBBA without last-minute excise taxes on solar that some lawmakers had proposed also helped stabilize investor sentiment in domestic solar and storage. The removal of those tariffs lent clearer direction to the U.S. clean energy supply chain and gave developers greater confidence in the viability of long-term projects. This shared agenda of capital rotating toward electrification, AI-driven power demand, and policy stability is creating room for a diverse set of energy names to outperform. These winners are not all pure-play renewables. They include integrated power operators, utilities reinventing themselves, and grid-tech enablers. Below are five off-the-radar energy stocks quietly outperforming their peers. Market Cap: $2.20B YTD Returns: 161.4% Israel-based smart energy SolarEdge (NASDAQ: SEDG) has been one of the best performers in the solar sector, alongside the broader Israeli stock market, with SEDG up in the triple digits thanks to the company’s improving business fundamentals. SolarEdge returned yet another healthy quarterly scorecard on Tuesday, with second quarter revenue of $289.4M (+9.0% Y/Y) beating the Wall Street consensus by $14.91 million, while non-GAAP EPS of -$0.81 beat by $0.03. According to SolarEdge CEO Yehoshua Nir, Trump’s OBBBA "validates our multiyear strategy of onshoring manufacturing to the U.S. by preserving the 45X advanced manufacturing credit for the next 7 years. We intend to manufacture in the U.S. and to ship U.S.-made SolarEdge products both domestically and across the globe for years to come." SolarEdge’s gross margins continued to improve, increasing 310 basis points sequentially to 11.1%. The company reported that the ongoing supply chain optimizations will cut gross margins by ~ 2%, down from a previous forecast of 4% to 6%. SolarEdge also issued upbeat guidance, with third quarter revenue in the range of $315 million to $355 million, representing 28.4% Y/Y growth at the midpoint while non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be 15% -19%, including the 2% of new tariff impact. Market Cap: $165.0B YTD Returns: 83.7% GE Vernova (NYSE:GE) is one of the youngest energy companies, having been spun off by industrial giant General Electric (NYSE:GE) in 2024. GE Vernova is a global energy company that develops and provides products and services for generating, transmitting, and orchestrating electricity. With a market cap roughly half that of its parent company, GE Vernova is one of the largest renewable energy companies, with its GE Renewable Energy division offering a broad portfolio of wind, hydro, storage, and solar technologies. GEV shares have increased more than five-fold from their IPO price, thanks to rising global demand for the company’s services, strong backlog growth and multiple tailwinds from electrification and decarbonization. However, the wild runup has lately attracted some downgrades from Wall Street, with RBC Capital recently trimming GEV price target from $631, with the bank saying the company’s strong outlook is already reflected in the valuation. Market Cap: $113.8B YTD Returns: 60.1% Constellation Energy Corp. (NYSE:CEG) produces and sells energy, including electricity and natural gas, along with sustainable energy solutions to commercial, industrial, residential, and public sector customers. The company operates a diverse portfolio of generation assets, including nuclear, wind, solar, natural gas, and hydroelectric power, with a total capacity of approximately 31,676 megawatts. CEG shares have been on a tear after the company unveiled an agreement in June to sell more than 1,100 MW of nuclear power to Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) from its Illinois nuclear plant for 20 years. According to The Wall Street Journal, the deal is the first deal of its kind for an operating nuclear plant in the United States, and closely mirrors a similar deal Constellation signed with Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) last year. The Microsoft deal is a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) that will see Constellation Energy restart its undamaged reactor in Three Mile Island, which was undergoing decommissioning. Neither deal will draw power from the main grid. However, Meta appears to have secured a better deal, with Citi’s Ryan Levine estimating that the 20-year PPA is priced in the $70-$95/MWh range, considerably cheaper than Jefferies' estimate of at least $110/MWh for Microsoft's PPA, because Meta’s deal “...does not offer a substantial premium for low-carbon nuclear power”. Levine has projected that ~70% of Constellation's existing nuclear plants could secure comparable datacenter deals at ~$80/MWh. Market Cap: $67.9B YTD Returns: 44.8% Irving, Texas-based Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) is an integrated power generation company that generates and sells power to residential, commercial, and industrial customers across the United States. The company operates a diverse portfolio of power generation facilities, including natural gas, nuclear, coal, solar, and battery energy storage, and serves customers through retail brands like TXU Energy and Ambit Energy. VST shares have easily outpaced their energy brethren thanks to the company recording increased power demand from AI data centers and strong results from recent PJM capacity auctions, which are creating a favorable market environment for Vistra's generation and retail operations. Vistra’s diversified fleet, strategic positioning in the nuclear power sector through the Harbor Energy acquisition, and focus on long-term growth and customer-tailored solutions also contribute to investor confidence. Market Cap: $10.3B YTD Returns: 12.7% The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) is a Virginia-based power generation and utility company that operates in the United States and internationally. AES is actively transforming into a leader in renewable energy, focusing on solar, wind, and energy storage solutions to accelerate a greener energy future. AES shares have been rallying following a report by the Financial Times that BlackRock's (NYSE:BLK) Global Infrastructure Partners plans to acquire the utility company soon, in what would be one of the largest infrastructure takeovers on record. The deal would value AES at ~$38 billion, AES’ $29 billion in debt. Global Infrastructure Partners, which BlackRock acquired a year ago, has a history of utility mergers, including a $6.2 billion deal that took public utility company Allete private.

Title: AI investments are pulling the US economy forward. Will it continue?

If businesses pull back on their AI spending because they find the tools are not that helpful, it could cause major problems for the AI industry. By Thor Benson Share Save Despite United States President Donald Trump’s tariff and immigration policies roiling businesses, the US economy is relatively stable. Experts say the country can thank the artificial intelligence (AI) industry for that. “AI machines—in quite a literal sense—appear to be saving the US economy right now,” George Saravelos of Deutsche Bank wrote to his clients at the end of September. “In the absence of tech-related spending, the US would be close to, or in, recession this year.” Economist and Nobel laureate Paul Krugman has made similar observations in his Substack newsletter. AI companies are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into AI infrastructure and development, and other US companies are spending billions on AI products. Just last month, a data centre in Abeline, Texas, the flagship site of the $500bn Stargate programme, a joint venture between Oracle, OpenAI and Japan’s SoftBank to advance AI infrastructure in the US, came online. Around the same time, chipmaker Nvidia said it would invest up to $100bn in OpenAI and provide it with data centre chips. It also became the first US company to hit a $4 trillion market value. It was soon followed in that benchmark by Microsoft, which has seen its stock price surge, with AI one of key factors driving business demand. Nvidia and Microsoft are not alone. Google’s parent company Alphabet and Meta Platforms, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, have upped their commitments to their AI ambitions and investments. All of this enthusiasm surrounding AI appears to be holding up the US economy for the moment, but there are fears that this could be a “bubble” similar to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. “The reason people are worried about an AI bubble is because seven companies are pulling more than 400 others forward,” Campbell Harvey, a professor of finance at Duke University, told Al Jazeera. A look at the S&P 500 shows that seven tech companies that are heavily involved in AI are the ones creating the most growth. Harvey admits that since it’s still early days in AI adoption and growth, it’s hard to say if the stocks of those tech companies are overvalued. “While share prices look somewhat elevated, there’s also real revenue behind the massive push to build data centres,” said Carl Frey, an associate professor of AI & Work at Oxford University. “A bubble may be building, but we’re nowhere near tulip mania territory,” he said, referring to the massive increase in tulip prices in the Netherlands in the 17th century, an event often held up as a hallmark of a bubble. “The worry is that early AI adopters are having second thoughts. Large corporations that rushed in are narrowing projects to the few that clearly save money or make money, and putting the rest on ice,” he said. For instance, major corporations like IBM and Klarna cut thousands of jobs in customer service and replaced them with AI—only to start reversing course not so long after they made that decision. They found the technology couldn’t do everything they hoped, compared to human workers. If major corporations that have spent large sums of money adopting AI tools end up deciding that these tools are not actually that useful for their businesses, that could be a serious problem for AI companies. They could end up with fewer customers, and their stock prices could begin to tumble as projected profits decline. A report released by MIT in August found that 95 percent of companies that have adopted AI are not achieving significant revenue acceleration from it. Data from the US Census Bureau shows that AI adoption by large companies has started to slow down recently. It would appear that people are starting to question the utility of these AI tools, which are often used to replace people in jobs like customer service, software engineering and several other entry-level jobs. “There’s a growing sense that a lot of companies raced to add AI to their operations last year because of the hype surrounding its power, and the fear of falling behind,” said Cal Newport, a professor of computer science at Georgetown University. “It turns out, however, that integrating generative AI, in particular, into existing workflows in significantly useful ways is harder than people thought.” Newport says the underlying models in these AI programmes are currently “too unreliable” to be able to successfully automate jobs. He notes the idea that we would see AI rapidly taking jobs right now “has simply not come true”. A recent Stanford study found that entry-level jobs in customer service, accounting and software development have decreased by 13 percent since 2022 because of the adoption of AI tools in large companies. It’s not clear that AI has reached “bubble” territory yet, but it might, and if that bubble were to burst, it could do a lot of damage to the US economy. Frey says the dot-com bubble was very costly for investors, but it “left behind technologies and infrastructure that ultimately lifted productivity.” The question is whether this AI situation will play out the same way. “Unless an AI bust topples a major lender and triggers a full-blown financial crisis, the bigger risk today is different,” Frey said. “AI hasn’t yet delivered a clear, broad-based productivity boost—precisely what our stagnating economies need.” Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: Valve’s Next Headset May Be Coming Soon, Just as Meta Loses Interest in VR

Time Published: 2025-10-09T15:08:36Z

reading time 3 minutes I’ve been hitting the “it’s a bad time to be into VR” note a lot lately, and, sorry ya’ll, I stand by that stance… but maybe not for long. As discouraging as this year has been for VR enthusiasts (Meta barely mentioned the Quest at its annual Connect dev conference), Valve might swoop in sooner than you think to give VR hardware a shred of hope or at least a little bit of excitement. According to a report for XR Institute (a Chinese analyst group that I’ve cited before for accurate forecasts on smart glasses), Valve’s long-rumored “Deckard” headset is finally entering mass production, with a chance that it could be available before the end of the year. XR Institute says that it expects Valve to launch Deckard (an internal codename for the headset) during the holiday season with a starting yearly production of about 400,000 to 600,000 units. That’s about the initial Vision Pro release levels of stock and certainly much more encouraging than rumors about Samsung’s Project Moohan, which suggest a launch in South Korea only to start. While Deckard’s existence is from news, its imminent arrival isÂ a big deal, not just because of Valve’s success in the hardware space with the Steam Deck, but because of the de-emphasis of VR by other major players in the space. Apple is reportedly deprioritizing a cheaper Vision Pro to focus on smart glasses, while Meta already started that same train by launching three new pairs of smart glasses and zero new VR/XR headsets. While this might not be a shining moment for VR writ large, I like the prospects of a Valve-made VR headset. While other companies like Apple and most likely Samsung tend to take a more scattershot approach to XR/VR, incorporating work and communication, I expect Valve to focus more on gaming and less on the other stuff, which… is a good thing. I’m not saying there aren’t cool or fun experiences to be had outside of gaming in an XR/VR headset, but entertainment (games in particular) is still the most compelling of those experiences. Don’t get me wrong, the audience for VR games is niche, even despite the ascendence of VR headsets over the last five years, but it seems to me that the people who use headsets the most are the ones who are more deeply invested in playing games in them. VR gaming enthusiasts’ response to Valve’s headset is still dependent on a lot of things, though, price chief among them. Rumors from earlier this year have suggested Deckard could cost around $1,000, which is notably a lot more expensive than the Quest 3 and even more so than the Quest 3S, but still well under the $3,500 Vision Pro. To justify that price, I assume Valve will have to lean into its display tech, offering better resolution and probably better performance than competitors like the Quest 3 and 3S. A lighter headset would be a nice perk, but I’m not sure what Valve will have to offer on the front, if anything. SteamOS in VR seems like an obvious opportunity here, though, again, I’m not sure anyone will be rushing out to buy a new VR headset just for the UI. There’s still a lot we don’t know about Deckard, so it’s hard to say for sure whether it’ll be the jolt of excitement VR fans are pining for, but at least (between Project Moohan and Deckard) there’s something to look forward to.

Jim Edwards is the executive editor for global news at Fortune. He was previously the editor-in-chief of Business Insider's news division and the founding editor of Business Insider UK. His investigative journalism has changed the law in two U.S. federal districts and two states. The U.S. Supreme Court cited his work on the death penalty in the concurrence to Baze v. Rees, the ruling on whether lethal injection is cruel or unusual. He also won the Neal award for an investigation of bribes and kickbacks on Madison Avenue. The S&P 500 hit a new all-time high Wednesday (up 0.58% on the day), driven as usual by tech stocks (the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.12%), despite the fact that both the IMF and the Bank of England warned that AI might be a bubble and stocks are due for a sharp correction. For weeks, all the talk on Wall Street is that the growth of the AI sector must, surely, be unsustainable and that this bubble is due to pop. The record-high price of gold alone suggests that a lot of investors want a hedge against an implosion in U.S. tech stocks. Yet some analysts are saying that you should believe the hype. They argue: The biggest cheerleader for AI is, of course, Dan Ives at Wedbush, who recently published a note titled “Expecting a Robust 3Q Tech Earnings Season to Match the AI Hype; Popcorn Moment.” “The cloud stalwarts Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon had very robust AI enterprise demand in the quarter based on our field checks. While some investors continue to question the valuations and pace of this tech spending trend, we believe to the contrary the Street is still underestimating how big this AI spending trajectory is,” he told clients. He believes these companies will spend $3 trillion on AI over the next three years. Importantly, that spending isn’t coming from debt or VC funding, according to Jan Frederik Slijkerman and Timothy Rahill at ING. They recently published a note examining whether all this AI spending might hurt corporate credit quality and discovered that … everything is totally fine! “Investments by the largest technology companies [Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle] are expected to surpass the U.S.$400 billion mark in 2026 … The investments described above are mind-blowing, given their scale. What is even more striking is that these investments have been funded from operating cash flows,” they wrote. “From a debtholder perspective, we are less concerned with a potential mismatch between supply and demand, as the large technology platforms mentioned above have funded their expansion plans from their cash flows,” they said. Goldman Sachs agrees, in part for the same reasons. The bank published a note yesterday titled “Why we are not in a bubble … yet,” which pretty much says it all. Still, surely stocks are overvalued? The majority of gains in the S&P 500 this year have been driven by a handful of tech companies. That concentration risk could hurt investors if there is a pullback. We aren’t there yet, according to Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial in Boston. “The forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of the S&P 500 has yet to reach dotcom era levels, and in fact remains below December 2020 levels because earnings were depressed coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic,” he said in a note today. “So large-cap stocks are expensive, lifted by AI-driven technology stocks, but not quite to the extremes of 25 years ago.” The economics of AI are much more robust than the dotcom era, he says. “Perhaps the key difference between the broader secular AI growth theme and the dotcom era is that large AI hyperscalers have mostly funded capital expenditures (capex) with strong internal cash flows, not through AI revenue in singularity or by issuing debt or equity. In comparison, dotcom era spending was broadly funded through massive amounts of ‘vendor financing,’ which ultimately led to the circular flow of capital that fueled the bubble burst.” And even if there is a correction, it won’t be too bad, argue Samuel Tombs and Oliver Allen at Pantheon Macroeconomics. They estimate that AI capex boosted U.S. GDP growth by 0.3% points. Even if it all disappeared it would not be enough to tip the U.S. into recession, they say. “Weaker growth is more likely than a recession if the AI boom turns to bust,” they said in a note to clients. “The likely hit from the AI boom turning to bust would be a significant drag on the economy, but probably a smaller shock than the bursting of the dotcom bubble in 2000, and an ensuing recession would be far from a forgone conclusion.” That comes with a caveat: “It would be more alarming, though, if a reversal of AI optimism led to a broader correction in the stock market beyond AI-linked companies, especially if the hit to households’ wealth and confidence tipped the fragile balance in the labor market, leading to a jump in the layoff rate,” they said.

Title: OpenAI's ChatGPT Instant Checkout: The Dawn of Conversational Commerce CX

CMSWire's Marketing & Customer Experience Leadership channel is the go-to hub for actionable research, editorial and opinion for CMOs, aspiring CMOs and today's customer experience innovators. Our dedicated editorial and research teams focus on bringing you the data and information you need to navigate today's complex customer, organizational and technical landscapes. We've got you covered. Since its November 2022 launch, ChatGPT has become synonymous with general AI capabilities. Now OpenAI is extending its influence toward a new frontier: ecommerce. OpenAI has officially transformed ChatGPT from a discovery tool into a complete commerce platform with the launch of Instant Checkout, powered by the Agentic Commerce Protocol developed in partnership with Stripe. Starting with U.S. Etsy sellers and expanding soon to over one million Shopify merchants, including Glossier, SKIMS, Spanx, and Vuori, this development represents more than just another checkout option. It is a fundamental reimagining of the customer experience journey that could have been implications on the customer experience industry. Customer experience professionals in e-commerce and retail recognize OpenAI’s entry as a signal that the entire paradigm of how customers discover and purchase products is shifting toward agentic commerce — online shopping managed with AI. Instant Checkout enables ChatGPT users to complete purchases without leaving the conversational interface. When someone asks a shopping-related question—"best running shoes under $100" or "gifts for a ceramics lover"—ChatGPT displays relevant products from across the web. For items where Instant Checkout is enabled, users see a "Buy" button that lets them complete the entire transaction within the chat. The technical foundation is the Agentic Commerce Protocol, an open-source standard co-developed with Stripe that OpenAI is making available to any merchant or developer. This protocol creates a secure payment framework where ChatGPT acts as the user's AI agent, passing information between customer and merchant while the merchant retains full control as the merchant of record. Merchants handle orders, process payments through their existing systems (Stripe or otherwise), manage fulfillment and own the customer relationship post-purchase. Currently supporting single-item purchases for U.S. users of the Plus, Pro, and Free tiers, OpenAI plans to expand to multi-item carts and additional regions. The company emphasizes that product recommendations are organic and unsponsored, ranked purely by relevance, with merchants paying a small transaction fee on completed purchases. For customers, the service is free and doesn't affect product prices. ChatGPT Plus and Pro subscribers can leverage saved payment methods and shipping details for even faster checkout, though all users must explicitly confirm each step before purchase. This represents OpenAI's first major move toward what they call "agentic commerce"—a platform where AI doesn't just help you find products but actively facilitates purchasing them on your behalf, with the long-term vision of more autonomous shopping experiences. Related Article: Agentic AI and the Future of Customer Support: What CX Leaders Need to Know Ecommerce has long been a goal of every digital platform, from the leaders of internet browsers to social media platforms. Yet the customer journey of most ecommerce attempts often includes friction points for customers to complete a purchase: multiple browser tabs and re-entering payment information, all while having users create an account, can lead to abandoned carts. Many experts had hoped social commerce – retail through social media – would minimize the friction points. The volume of US social commerce did rise, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The rise of direct-to-customer retail placed a spotlight on aligning click-through behavior and sales, creating high interest in a cart checkout with just a few clicks. OpenAI's launch of Instant Checkout approaches a speedy checkout with a "chat to checkout in just a few taps." Here's how Instant Checkout works: A customer asks ChatGPT for "gifts for a ceramics lover," receives curated product recommendations, sees a "Buy" button on items with Instant Checkout enabled, and completes the purchase without ever leaving the conversation. For ChatGPT Plus and Pro subscribers, the platform can prefill shipping and payment details, making the experience even more seamless. This level of convenience raises the digital customer experience bar significantly. If customers can complete a purchase in seconds through conversational AI, they'll increasingly expect similarly frictionless experiences everywhere else. Retailers who maintain clunky checkout processes will feel the comparison acutely. One of the most significant customer experience implications involves trust and transparency. OpenAI emphasizes that product results are "organic and unsponsored, ranked purely on relevance to the user," and that Instant Checkout availability doesn't influence product rankings. When multiple merchants sell the same product, ChatGPT considers availability, price, quality, primary seller status and Instant Checkout availability to optimize user experience. One potential shift for customers is the kinds of trust signals to look while shopping online. Customers have spent years learning which search results, sponsored placements and algorithmic recommendations to trust. They know when they're being marketed to. Conversational AI collapses those visual cues. There's no "Ad" label or comparison shopping pages, verifying that you're seeing the best options. For CX professionals, this creates a paradox. The experience feels more personal and helpful—like getting advice from a knowledgeable friend—but the mechanisms driving recommendations remain opaque. OpenAI's commitment to relevance-based ranking is important, but maintaining customer trust will require ongoing transparency about how these decisions are made. Unlike marketplace models where the platform intermediates the customer relationship, OpenAI positions itself as the customer's "AI agent—securely passing information between user and merchant, just like a digital personal shopper would." Merchants remain the merchant of record, handling orders, payments, fulfillment and customer support through their existing systems. This architectural choice has profound CX implications. When issues arise—damaged goods, shipping delays, return requests—customers must navigate the merchant's existing support infrastructure. They can't simply resolve everything in ChatGPT. OpenAI explicitly states that "merchants use your order information to complete the order, but OpenAI asks merchants to not sign users up for marketing emails from their ChatGPT orders." This creates a potential friction point. Customers who complete purchases in a conversational environment may expect conversational support. They'll ask ChatGPT about order status, return policies or replacement requests. While ChatGPT can surface information, the actual resolution still requires engaging with the merchant directly. For retailers, this means your post-purchase CX needs to match the seamlessness of the purchasing experience. If ChatGPT makes buying easy but your support remains difficult, the disconnect will be glaring. ChatGPT's existing features—Memory, Custom Instructions and conversation history—create opportunities for deeply personalized commerce experiences. The platform can remember that you prefer sustainable products, have a specific budget range, or are shopping for someone with particular interests. This contextual awareness enables product recommendations that feel genuinely helpful rather than algorithmically generic. For customer experience strategy, this represents a shift from session-based commerce to persistent relationship commerce. Instead of starting fresh with each visit, customers maintain an ongoing dialogue where preferences, constraints and needs are already understood. It's the digital equivalent of shopping with a personal stylist who remembers your taste, size and budget. However, this also requires rethinking privacy and consent. OpenAI notes that "to respond to your shopping question, ChatGPT uses your query and available context (such as Memory or Custom instructions)." Customers may not fully grasp how much information they're sharing through casual conversation or how it's being used to shape recommendations. Related Article: Humans Put ChatGPT Customer Experience Outcomes to the Test Currently, Instant Checkout supports single-item purchases only. OpenAI plans to add multi-item carts and expand merchant and regional availability. But the real customer experience transformation lies in what OpenAI calls "agentic commerce"—where AI doesn't just help you find what to buy but actually makes purchases on your behalf. Imagine asking ChatGPT to "stock my pantry with staples I usually buy" or "replace my worn-out workout clothes with similar items" and having it autonomously complete those purchases based on your preferences, budget and past behavior. OpenAI emphasizes that "users stay in control—they explicitly confirm each step before any action is taken," but it's easy to see how this could evolve toward greater autonomy. From a CX perspective, this promises ultimate convenience but introduces new anxieties. What happens when the AI makes a wrong assumption? How do you dispute an order you didn't manually approve? What safeguards prevent accidental purchases during casual conversation? These aren't theoretical concerns—they're fundamental customer experience challenges that will need addressing as agentic commerce matures. Traditional ecommerce has maintained a clear separation between discovery (search engines, social media, content sites) and purchase (retailer websites, marketplaces). ChatGPT collapses this continuum entirely. The same conversation that starts with "how do I decorate a small apartment" can seamlessly transition to purchasing specific furniture pieces without the customer ever consciously entering "shopping mode." This fluidity creates immense convenience but also removes traditional decision-making waypoints. In conventional ecommerce, the journey from discovery to checkout includes multiple opportunities for price comparison, reading reviews and specification verification. Conversational commerce compresses these steps, potentially reducing buyer confidence even as it increases convenience. Savvy retailers will need to ensure their product information, reviews and trust signals are accessible within conversational contexts. If ChatGPT recommends your product, customers should still be able to access detailed specifications quickly, customer reviews, return policies and other information that builds purchase confidence. Actions ecommerce and CX professionals can take to prepare for conversational commerce. OpenAI's move follows a broader trend of commerce functionality migrating to conversational interfaces powered by AI. Meta has been experimenting with business messaging on WhatsApp and Instagram. Google has integrated shopping into search results, hoping to further leverage its AI Overview integration with its search engine. But OpenAI's approach—combining product discovery, recommendation and checkout entirely within a conversational AI interface—represents the most complete implementation yet. OpenAI’s decision to open-source the Agentic Commerce Protocol suggests ecosystem ambitions. By creating a standard that works across AI platforms and payment processors, OpenAI is positioning conversational commerce as infrastructure, not just a ChatGPT feature. Marketing professionals must monitor adoption of conversational commerce as an element of marketing strategies and campaigns. Moreover, competitors who are still finding their AI strategy will see the Agentic Commerce Protocol as a significant competitor. Amazon, for example, has long offered shopping capabilities with Alexa. But partners in the Alexa ecosystem may move toward Open AI if Amazon does not launch a similar AI protocol for Alexa. Traditional ecommerce metrics—bounce rate, cart abandonment, time on site—don't translate cleanly to conversational commerce. New ways to measure engagement, conversion and satisfaction when shopping happens inside AI conversations. These metrics will help retailers understand whether conversational commerce delivers genuine CX improvements or simply novelty-driven early adoption. OpenAI's Instant Checkout raises as many customer experience questions as it answers: How will product returns work when the purchase was made conversationally? Can customers modify orders placed through ChatGPT? What happens when products are out of stock after ChatGPT recommends them? How do subscription services and recurring purchases translate to conversational commerce? What safeguards prevent accidental purchases during ambiguous conversations? These implementation details are fundamental to whether conversational commerce is a fit for the seamless customer experience being sought. Marketers should consider whether the answers mean achieving the promised experiences or are an indicator of implementation frustrations. Learn how you can join our contributor community.

Elon Musk's massive Tesla pay package could see him earn billions without achieving revolutionary goals. Experts suggest easier targets, like modest vehicle sales and vague product definitions, could net him tens of billions. While the board claims the package is performance-based, an analysis reveals potential payouts far exceeding ambitious milestones, raising questions about true accountability.

Title: Six Mag 7 Stocks Failed To Hit New Highs Wednesday As Indexes Did So

ByJohn Navin, Contributor. That these Mag 7 stocks could not make it up to new highs while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 hit their new highs is peculiar. It’s the type of negative divergence that probably attracts the attention of Wall Street algorithms designed to be on the lookout for such things and to react according to their highly attuned programming. Alphabet The stock hit a peak of $255 in mid-September, sold off, rallied briefly and now trades for $244. No new high. The upward angle of the 50-day moving average is unusually strong. Today’s close is far above the 200-day moving average. The price-earnings ratio is 34. Alphabet has a market capitalization of $2401.95. Amazon The stock peaked in February at just above $240 (not seen on this chart). The early September re-test of that level failed. Today’s closing price was just above $220, just under the 50-day moving average. It appears as if Amazon has now tested the level of the 200-day moving average and managed to remain above it. The price-earnings ratio is 34. Market cap is $2401.95 billion. Broadcom The semiconducter giant hit a high of near $370 in early September. Today’s price closed the session at $345. It’s a sign of some weakness that Broadcom is unable to make it up to the old high on a day when the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 both hit new highs. Broadcom’s market cap is $1631.58 billion. The price-earnings ratio is 88. Meta The peak at near $800 arrived in August and the stock now goes for $717. An attempted retest of the previous high came in mid-September and failed. Meta Platforms now has nine closing days below the 50-day moving average. Mark Zuckerberg’s internet content company has a market cap of $1803.19 billion. The price-earnings ratio is 26. Netflix The stock peaked in late June up there just above $1325 and has since declined to today’s closing price of $1214. It seems to be magnetized since early August to the 50-day moving average. Netflix has a market cap of $515.97 billion. The price-earnings ratio is 51.74. Tesla The stock peaked on the first day of October at $470 and today closed at $438 – no new high here for CEO Elon Musk and friends. The 50-day moving average in September crossed above the 200-day moving average, so there’s that. Whether the momentum can be regained remains to be seen. Market cap is $1458.71 billion. The price-earnings ratio is 254. For comparison’s sake, here are the daily price charts for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 aka “the major indexes:” S&P 500 It’s a new high today, just barely. The peak is a bit clearer on the hourly chart, but it’s definitely there. Nasdaq 100 Today’s new high here is clear as a bell. Apple is the one Mag 7 name that managed a new high today.

Title: Bank of England Warns of an AI Bubble Burst
URL: https://gizmodo.com/bank-of-england-warns-of-an-ai-bubble-burst-2000669588
Time Published: 2025-10-08T15:45:13Z

reading time 3 minutes The central bank of the United Kingdom is worried about an AI bubble burst. “On a number of measures, equity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on Artificial Intelligence (AI),” the bank’s financial policy committee said, according to a record of its latest meeting. “This, when combined with increasing concentration within market indices, leaves equity markets particularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic.” The Bank also warned that stock market price valuations were comparable to the peak of the dot-com bubble, and the market share of the top five members of the S&P 500 was at its highest concentration in 50 years. Those five companies are, unsurprisingly, AI-focused tech giants Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta. All five of these companies are spending eye-watering figures on AI, and the stock market loves it. Microsoft became the second company to ever hit a $4 trillion market valuation earlier this year after posting its largest ever quarterly expenditure forecast. Nvidia, on the other hand, is the first and only company in the world to hit a $4.5 trillion market cap. “Material bottlenecks to AI progress â from power, data, or commodity supply chains â as well as conceptual breakthroughs which change the anticipated AI infrastructure requirements for the development and utilisation of powerful AI models could also harm valuations, including for companies whose revenue expectations are derived from high levels of anticipated AI infrastructure investment,” the bank said. Fed researchers issued a similar warning earlier this year. While that alert did not identify an immediate risk of an AI bubble, the researchers pointed out that a risk that comes with building expensive infrastructure too quickly for anticipated demand was that demand might not grow as expected. In that case, it could lead to “disastrous consequences,” the Fed warned, likening it to the railroad over-expansion of the 1800s that led to an economic depression towards the turn of the century. These top AI companies with high revenue expectations are also heavily reliant on each other financially, increasing worries of a cascade effect if a bubble bursts. AI companies ink multibillion-dollar deals with each other over and over again, injecting more money into the system and ballooning stock valuations with each deal. While that’s happening, some experts are admitting overvaluation. Apollo Global Management’s chief economist Torsten Slok said in July that the AI bubble of today is actually worse than the 1999 dot-com bubble. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also admitted in August that he thinks investors are “over-excited about AI.” The main downside risks of AI overvaluation, according to the bank, also include disappointing AI capability or adoption progress. A recent MIT report found that despite the major push to adopt AI in the corporate world, fewer than one in ten AI pilot programs actually generated real revenue gains. The report spooked investors enough that AI stocks immediately slid following the headlines in August. Last month, the Census Bureau showed that the rate of AI adoption by large companies had been declining slightly. Nonetheless, executives keep assuring investors that AI demand is scaling rapidly as the technology finds its way into more and more areas of life. AI computing demand is up “substantially” in the past six months, according to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s comments on Wednesday. But if the tech giants are wrong and the Bank of England’s risk scenario does end up being the case, the bank warned that a sudden, sharp correction could occur, “adversely affecting the cost and availability of finance for households and businesses.” The U.S. has reason to be afraid of this. According to recent reports, the AI spending frenzy is not just propping up the American stock market, but it’s also lifting the real economy. According to Harvard economist James Furman‘s calculations, U.S. GDP growth in the first half of the year was almost entirely driven by investments made in data centers and other information-processing technology.

AI art really has become the aesthetic of grifters and fascists. The company dropped plans for a 244-acre project as resource-intensive data centers spread across the country. Meta expects expects 80% of Metaverse employees to have AI integrated into their daily routines by the end of the year. So long as Lee is president of DC Studios, the company will not have its heroes drawn or written by AI. Nvidia previously claimed you needed its GPUs to achieve multi-frame generation. Intel says "nuh uh." Trump supporters are doubling down on AI sadism. Â©2025 GIZMODO USA LLC. All rights reserved.

Title: Investors can’t hold back their AI bubble jitters anymore as gold pushes beyond $4,000 per ounce

U.S. stocks are edging higher, a day after breaking their seven-day winning streak, while the price of gold is pushing further past $4,000 per ounce. The S&P 500 rose 0.2% in early trading Wednesday and is near its all-time high set on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 51 points, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.4%. AST SpaceMobile soared after Verizon Communications agreed to use its space-based network to offer service to its cellular customers when needed, starting next year. The stock market is near records, but trading has been muted recently following the U.S. government’s latest shutdown. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. Wall Street ticked slightly higher in early trading Wednesday after posting the first loss in eight days. Futures for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each rose 0.1% before the bell, while futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2%. The price of gold, which topped $4,000 per ounce for the first time on Tuesday, continued to rise, trading up nearly $53, or 1.3%, at $4,057.50. Investors have traditionally seen gold as a hedge against high inflation. Its price has soared more than 50% this year because of governments’ huge debt loads, political uncertainties and anticipation that the Fed will continue to trim its benchmark lending rate after cutting for the first time this year in September. The minutes of that September meeting will be released today at 2 p.m. ET, which investors and analysts will scour for clues about how many more rate cuts could be coming this year. Most economists are expecting at least one more cut as the Fed tries to manage a weakening labor market and inflation that remains above its target of 2%. Equifax gained 2.5% before the bell after the credit reporting agency slashed the price of its mortgage credit score product by more than 50% below competitor Fair Isaac’s. Fair Isaac shares soared last week after it announced a program to streamline access to its FICO credit scores. Fair Isaac shares slid 3.7% before the bell Wednesday. Artificial intelligence stocks are mixed as Bank of England warned Wednesday of the rising risk that tech stock share prices pumped up by the AI boom could face a “sudden correction.” “On a number of measures, equity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on Artificial Intelligence,” policymakers at the U.K. central bank said in a report. With Big Tech companies accounting for an increasingly outsize share of stock market indexes, stocks are “particularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic.” AI stocks have been on a tear this year. Chipmaker Nvidia is up nearly 40% since January, Oracle is up 70% and Palantir is up 140%. Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft are all up sharply. In Europe at midday the CAC 40 in Paris gained 0.8% as departing Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu, aiming to calm the political storm triggered by his resignation on Monday less than 24 hours after unveiling his ministers, raced to beat a deadline Wednesday to break a deadlock caused by his decision to quit. Germany’s DAX rose 0.7%, while the FTSE 100 jumped 0.9%. The U.S. dollar has risen against the euro, thanks to the upheavals in France, and also against the Japanese yen. The yen has fallen sharply on expectations that Sanae Takaichi, the conservative lawmaker likely to become the next prime minister, will push to keep interest rates low. The dollar rose to 152.70 yen from 151.90 yen early Wednesday, while the euro slipped to $1.1633 from $1.1659. Tokyo’s benchmark Nikkei 225 shed 0.5% to 47,734.99. It had jumped to new records earlier this week after the ruling Liberal Democrats chose Takaichi as their leader last weekend. She is expected to increase spending and to advocate for easier credit, possibly slowing efforts by the Bank of Japan to raise its key interest rate. It has remained near zero for years, even as inflation has exceeded its target of about 2%, outpacing wage increases. The government reported Wednesday that inflation-adjusted wages fell in August for the eighth straight month. “While the economic case for tighter monetary policy remains intact, we suspect that the Bank of Japan will use the pressure by Japan’s incoming government as an opportunity to delay rate hikes until January,” Marcel Thieliant of Capital Economics said in a commentary. Lawmakers in Japan’s lower house of parliament are due to elect a successor to Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba later this month. The Liberal Democrats hold the most seats despite not having an outright majority, so Takaishi is expected to become the country’s first female prime minister. Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 0.5% to 26,829.46 and the S&P/ASX 200 edged 0.1% lower to 8,947.60. Markets in mainland China and South Korea were closed for holidays. In Taiwan, the Taiex lost 0.5%. India’s Sensex was up 0.1%. Also early Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil was up 81 cents, or 1.3%, at $62.54 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 79 cents to $66.24 per barrel. _____ AP Business Writer Kelvin Chan contributed to this report from London. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: AppLovin Stock Up 85%. Learn Whether To Bet Against $APP
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2025/10/08/applovin-stock-up-85-learn-whether-to-bet-against-app/

ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. AppLovin stock experienced sharp volatility, dropping then recovering significantly, as an SEC investigation into its data practices emerged amidst analyst buy recommendations.The company is reportedly under SEC investigation for alleged "fingerprinting" data collection, spurred by short-seller claims, which AppLovin denies as false and misleading.Despite strong financial performance and AI-powered growth, AppLovin faces risks from potential regulatory sanctions, high valuation, and insider selling. AppLovin stock is up 85% in 2025. However, the stock fell 14% on Monday and dropped 3% in Tuesday premarket trading before reversing course – ending the day up 7.6%. The recovery may have been due to reports from Citigroup and Oppenheimer which reiterated their buy recommendations and suggested the market overreacted to reports into an investigation of the company by the Securities and Exchange Commission, noted MarketBeat. But short sellers – ApplLovin’s short interest is 6.6% of its float, according to the Wall Street Journal – have issued reports raising questions about how the mobile advertising company delivers its services. Their questions may have prompted an SEC investigation of AppLovin’s data-collection practices, according to Bloomberg. The company’s rapid and highly profitable growth make a compelling case for AppLovin bulls. However, if the SEC investigation results in changes to the company’s business model, the company’s growth could slow – rewarding the short sellers with a drop in the company’s stock. AppLovin denies short sellers’ claims. “It’s disappointing that a few nefarious short-sellers are making false and misleading claims aimed at undermining our success, and driving down our stock price for their own financial gain, rather than acknowledging the sophisticated AI models our team has built to enhance advertising for our partners,” AppLovin CEO Adam Foroughi wrote in February blog post. AppLovin did not comment on the report of an SEC investigation. “We regularly engage with regulators and if we get inquiries we address them in the ordinary course,” the company said in an email to Bloomberg. “Material developments, if any, would be disclosed through the appropriate public channels.” Neither did the SEC. “During the shutdown, the SEC’s public affairs office is not able to respond to many inquiries from the press,” the agency said by email to Bloomberg. I think AppLovin’s positives outweigh the negatives. Moreover, selling a stock short – borrowing shares from a broker, selling them, and hoping to repay the loan at a profit by buying back the shares at a lower price – is extremely risky. If AppLovin was poised to go out of business, that might be a risk worth considering. But that does not appear imminent. Indeed, analysts estimate the stock could rise 5% to meet their price target. Traders who see more downside in the company’s stock might buy puts – which provide the option, but not the obligation – to sell the stock at a specific price the trader hopes will be higher than the market price. I have requested comment from AppLovin and will update this post if I receive a reply. The SEC is reportedly looking into the company’s data collection practices. More specifically, the agency has assigned cyber and emerging technologies officials to investigate “allegations that AppLovin violated platform partners’ service agreements to push more targeted advertising to consumers,” according to anonymous sources featured in a Bloomberg report. A whistleblower complaint and several short-seller reports published in the last several months have prompted the SEC investigation. AppLovin has not been charged and such probes may result in fines for companies or corporate officials, reported Bloomberg. AppLovin stock has been rising rapidly – with the company’s market capitalization soaring 700% in 2024 and its market capitalization nearly doubling this year to $230 billion as of last week, according to CNBC. The company helps mobile app developers find users and sell advertising in their apps. In September, AppLovin was added to the S&P 500 – rising on a “wave of interest in artificial intelligence tools and ad placement,” noted Bloomberg. Here are bullish indicators for the stock: A big reason to avoid the stock is the risk of regulatory sanctions if the SEC finds valid the short seller and whistleblower allegations against the company. Short seller reports allege AppLovin has violated data collection rules. For example, Fuzzy Panda and Muddy Waters accused AppLovin of fingerprinting – unauthorized harvesting of proprietary identifiers from other platforms "to track users across different websites and apps and retarget them with advertising,” noted Bloomberg. Apple’s App Store prohibits fingerprinting as did Google until a February policy change, added Bloomberg. AppLovin challenged the short seller reports saying they were “littered with inaccuracies” and denied creating “alternative accurate and persistent identifiers, typically called device fingerprints,” noted Foroughi’s blog post. AppLovin also hired Alex Spiro – whose clients include Elon Musk, according to Business Insider. Spiro is conducting an “independent review and investigation into recent short report activity,” reported Bloomberg, and continues to investigate the source of the reports which he dubbed “clearly false.” Here are other reasons to avoid the stock: Wall Street views AppLovin shares as slightly undervalued. Based on 18 analysts offering 12 month price targets for AppLovin, the stock would need to rise 5% to reach their average price target of $664.41, according to TipRanks.

Login New issue, “Borders,” out now. Get a discounted subscription to our print magazine today. Your support keeps us publishing! Most major corporations — from airlines to social media platforms — now aspire to become unregulated banks. Bankification today accounts for the highest profit margins in the US economy, crippling productive capacity and setting the stage for the next crash. Airlines lose money on flights and make windfall profits off credit cards and frequent-flyer programs that are bad for consumers. But the phenomenon isn’t limited to flying banks like Delta — almost every major US corporation now aspires to be a bank. (Mustafa Kaya / Xinhua via Getty Images) Jacobin‘s fall issue, “Borders,” is out now. Follow this link to get a discounted subscription to our beautiful print quarterly. The US economy is turning into one giant bank. Starbucks holds nearly $2 billion of customers’ money in its rewards program. That’s more than the total deposits managed by 85 percent of chartered banks, making the coffee chain one of the biggest financial institutions in the country. Conversely, Capital One, one of the world’s top banks, now operates its own cafes on city street corners. Airlines are now little more than flying banks, given that they make more money from selling frequent-flyer points to credit card companies than they do flying passengers. More Americans than ever are in debt to their nearby grocery store due to predatory “buy now, pay later” loans offered during checkout. As you’re wheeled into an emergency medical procedure, the nurse may ask if you’d prefer to pay on a deferred-payment loan plan, an increasingly common way to finance health care expenses. And if you can’t pay your rent on time, it could soon become common for your apartment building owner to lend you the money, putting you in debt to your landlord. These are snapshots of the new wave of financialization sweeping across the country, where the lines between finance and commerce are being blurred. Upward of 40 percent of Americans now pay for basic items like groceries and health care using borrowed money — and this excludes credit cards. A third of younger Americans hold their savings on nonbank tech platforms like Venmo, and industries from retail to transportation derive anywhere from 14 percent to half of their profits from partnerships with credit card companies. While this new type of financialization takes many different forms, the endgame is the same: Most major corporations now aspire to become unregulated banks, opening up new avenues to make even more money hand over fist. Banks operating credit cards are the highest-profit-margin enterprises in the economy. Every company wants a share of the loot, amassed from high fees and low overhead costs. This development has been supercharged by the Silicon Valley investor class, under the Orwellian term “embedded finance.” Others call it “bankification.” The peddlers of embedded finance promise a world of “frictionless transactions,” providing consumers efficiency and convenience by integrating financial and nonfinancial services. But these new profit streams come with a range of potential harms. Financial policy watchdogs warn that bankification is unleashing predatory and fraudulent practices onto consumers, workers, and smaller businesses. It may even lay the groundwork for the next financial collapse. After all, can a widget factory be trusted to manage customers’ money and make safe lending decisions without putting the entire financial system at risk? During the Biden administration, regulators launched rules and investigations to limit corporations’ new banking ambitions. But those actions have since been terminated by the Trump administration, which has signaled that it will instead open up new channels for this fusion of finance and commerce to proceed — an experiment that could prove disastrous for the country. Bankification “encapsulates so much of what we should have learned [from 2008] and what could go wrong,” said Arthur Wilmarth, a law professor emeritus at George Washington University and author of the book Taming the Megabanks: Why We Need a New Glass-Steagall Act, which warns about the effect of mixing nonbanks into the financial system. “It’s the recipe for a subprime crisis 2.0. Why would we want to see that play out again?” The quest to combine banking and commerce has been one of the holy grails of robber barons for centuries. In the nineteentth century, industry tycoons like John Pierpont Morgan and Jay Gould used their banking fortunes to finance the expansion of their own railroad projects. In the twentieth century, banking empires such as A.P. Giannini’s TransAmerica (now Bank of America) controlled manufacturing ventures from oil and gas to home construction and even frozen foods before Congress forced the conglomerates to divest from commercial enterprises. Bankification usually follows the same pattern: Once businesses dominate their market, monopolizing the heavy-industry sectors isn’t enough. Companies instead set their sights on acquiring the lifeblood of commerce: banking, where they can make money off of money by lending capital to be repaid with interest and collecting fees on financial transactions. Instead of haggling with risk-averse bankers or courting new investors for financing, corporations could set up their own financial institutions to receive customer deposits, tap these pools of capital to fund their own projects at better rates, and cut off banking access to competitors that encroach on their market share or unions that meddle with the business. Ever greater financialization, however, has crippled the American economy. After a wave of financial deregulation in the 1980s, Wall Street looked to expand beyond the bounds of traditional finance. In the corporate raider era, private equity firms and hedge funds began acquiring ever more Fortune 500 companies through buyouts and stock market ownership. The pressure to deliver shareholder returns pushed companies to outsource manufacturing jobs overseas, leaving the United States with an economy dominated by high finance and software technology. Despite industry titans’ plans for total control of the financial economy, lawmakers have long recognized that cross-ownership of banking and commerce would concentrate too much financial risk. “We treat banks as systemically important to our society, so we subsidize them as a public good through things like FDIC insurance, because if they go out of business, that’s a problem in a way that Macy’s going out of business isn’t,” explained Brad Lipton, the director of the corporate power and financial regulation program at the Roosevelt Institute and a former senior consumer financial protection regulator during the Biden administration. “You don’t want to mix the two.” Regulators first established a firm legal separation between the sectors with the National Banking Act of 1864, which codified rules for national banking charters. The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 shored up those rules, taking aim at the banking subsidiaries that conglomerates were using to circumvent regulations. But corporate America has continuously found ways to circumvent these legal prohibitions. The last major fight to ensure a clear separation between banking and commerce took place in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. In the lead-up to the disaster, which would result in over five million foreclosures and roughly ten million job losses, giant commercial firms like General Motors and General Electric used a decades-old legal loophole to operate “industrial loan companies.” These largely unregulated financial arms made poor lending decisions, such as acquiring growing portfolios of risky subprime mortgages. The mass defaults of these mortgages ultimately contributed to their owners’ bankruptcies, requiring federal bailouts. The Dodd-Frank Act, passed in 2010, tried to put an end to these industrial banks by issuing a federal moratorium on new bank charters, among other banking reforms. But since then, a bold new wave of bankification has taken shape, further diverting companies’ resources from production to financial extraction. In 2020, a general partner at the venture capital heavyweight Andreessen Horowitz delivered a speech titled “Every Company Will Be a Fintech Company.” The presentation outlined the vision behind a nascent industry called “embedded finance,” urging companies of all kinds to integrate financial services into their operations or lose out on future growth. “Embedded finance” now appears in startup pitch decks and conference panels nearly as regularly as terms like AI and crypto, acting like a Pavlovian bell to get the attention of financiers for seed capital. “The business world realized that adding a financial services element to nearly every product is a way to supercharge their attractiveness to Silicon Valley and Wall Street,” said Seth Frotman, former general counsel at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the Biden administration. Along with other major investment firms, Andreessen Horowitz now holds substantial stakes in these ventures. The venture capital fund has estimated that adding financial services, from selling insurance product warranties on goods to speeding up the online checkout process by leveraging data collection, can boost companies’ revenues by two to five times per customer and generate $230 billion in added revenue by the end of this year. Big Tech’s main focus so far has been payment processing services, for which they can charge fees on each transaction. Apple Pay, the largest of these networks, already boasts nearly 750 million active users worldwide and facilitates transactions worth trillions of dollars. Google, Meta, Amazon, and now even OpenAI also operate their own payment networks, which act as middlemen to facilitate contactless transactions and manage customers’ money. Along with financial technology companies like PayPal, Venmo, and CashApp, these payment apps offer digital wallets, usually connected to customers’ bank accounts, that store balances and transfer funds. These payment networks have transformed the financial services industry so quickly that Wall Street banks are running scared. Despite these products’ ostensible convenience for consumers, payment processing services come with a variety of financial risks. For starters, while payment networks’ transaction fees are far lower than the credit card companies’ swipe fees, as these payment networks become more ubiquitous and acquire market power, rates could increase. Apple Pay collects a standard commission of less than a percent on every transaction, which in aggregate amounts to a billion-dollar windfall for the company. Tech companies are also effectively managing their customers’ digital balances without the protections of traditional financial institutions. When money sits in a bank account, it’s usually insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), a federal agency that reimburses depositors’ money if it disappears during an event like a bank run. But funds sitting in a Venmo account or a stored-value account in Apple Wallet are not insured. Financial regulators estimate that these payment apps are holding billions of dollars of completely uninsured deposits. If the apps suffered a technical glitch, got hacked, or unexpectedly went bankrupt, customers could lose their money. This happened in 2024 when Synapse, a technology company connecting fintech apps like Juno and Yotta with banks, suddenly collapsed, putting nearly one hundred thousand customers at risk of losing their life savings. Thousands did. Amanda Fischer, a financial policy expert at the research organization Better Markets, notes that there’s also a taxpayer risk if these payment processing services collapse. With their current growth rate, tech giants’ banking footprints could become “too big to fail,” potentially requiring a taxpayer bailout to avoid a nationwide economic collapse. “Imagine the millions of people that use Amazon are now maintaining balances on their account, and something goes wrong with Amazon corporate,” said Fischer, who served as the chief of staff and senior counselor to the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission during the Biden administration. “It’s a really good way to take the U.S. government hostage.” There’s another concern: A driving factor behind Big Tech’s payments networks — as with all embedded finance — is the new opportunities it provides for consumer surveillance. “Payments have gone from this really sleepy blackwater to the cutting-edge forefront of consumer issues, and a lot of that is due to the monetization of financial data,” said Frotman, the former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau general counsel. Frotman added that users’ financial information is one of the last remaining frontiers for data privacy. That’s because sensitive financial data, unlike online shopping patterns or location tracking, has typically been well protected at tightly regulated banking institutions. By running payment networks, Google, Meta, and Amazon have a God’s-eye view into financial transactions that take place not just on their own platforms but across others when users pay with their digital wallets. In a 2023 speech, former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Rohit Chopra said that the tech firms “have a strong incentive to surveil all aspects of a consumer’s transactions, since this data can advantage the rest of their businesses.” By identifying users’ purchasing habits, tech companies could exploit those tendencies to sell people more goods or keep them on the platform. What’s more, by controlling banking services, tech companies can also cut users out of the financial system for any reason, in a process called “debanking.” “Corporate surveillance activities can also raise a range of questions about espionage, tracking, and censorship,” said Chopra. Simultaneously, Silicon Valley’s entry into banking has also created a countervailing bankification effect: Threatened by Big Tech’s encroachment, Wall Street firms are now trying to edge into tech’s core business. JPMorgan, for example, launched an advertising brokerage last year to compete with Big Tech’s digital advertising empire. It’s more likely than not that bankification is already hiding in plain sight in your wallet. While your credit cards used to be simply branded with big bank names like Chase, Capital One, and American Express, now they’re often linked to specific corporate brands, like Costco, Disney, Netflix, and even NASCAR. More and more businesses, especially in retail, are offering credit cards to encourage consumer spending on their brands. More than half of the country’s top one hundred retailers, for example, now offer their own business-specific credit cards, including Target, Macy’s, and Nordstrom. The resulting revenues, split between businesses and the partnered credit card companies, are highly lucrative. For the top segment of large retailers, payments on store-specific cards generate up to 14 percent of company profits, a critical income stream for businesses operating on relatively thin profit margins. If not for the hundreds of millions it makes from its widely used credit cards, the Kohl’s department store chain would be in the red. No sector is more dependent on its credit cards than the airline industry. Even though all of the country’s major airlines lost money on flying passengers last year, the companies still earned billions in operating profits — mostly from revenues they earned from unregulated frequent-flier programs they operate through branded credit cards. In 2023, Delta Air Lines, the world’s most lucrative airline, generated the bulk of its $4.6 billion in operating income from its deal with American Express, and so far this year, nearly all of its earnings have come from the credit card company. This arrangement led the legal scholar and airline expert Ganesh Sitharaman to conclude that “frequent-flier [points] systems… turned airlines into something more like financial institutions that happen to fly planes on the side.” While these frequent-flier programs promise rewards like discounted seats or free flights, experts say these perks are rarely good deals for consumers. As recent investigations and government probes have revealed, airlines have been known to put their thumbs on the scale to devalue and distort points when it helps their bottom line. That includes a 2024 Department of Transportation investigation that probed the airlines for systematically devaluing their point systems and raising reward thresholds to reduce the number of free flights and other perks offered to customers. “Airlines will [deviate] the point prices compared to the dollar price… in order to affect the overall value of the monetary supply of points,” said Brian Shearer, director of competition and regulatory policy at the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator. “It’s almost as though they’re acting like their own central bankers.” For example, Delta in 2023 switched the metric for its SkyMiles points system from miles traveled to total customer spending, which dramatically devalued the points accrued by its customers. The changes were met with widespread outrage by budget-conscious travelers, since their flights would no longer generate as many points. One well-known blogger at the credit card–focused travel site The Points Guy declared that he would “stop chasing airline status.” Similarly, credit card reward programs in other industries rarely pay off for customers. “Consumers think they’re getting convenience, but businesses get new ways to monetize your data and make revenue [off] you,” said Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America. “The trade-off in the end balances out to favor companies in ways many consumers don’t realize in terms of the security and privacy of their money and data.” At a basic level, loyalty rewards work similarly to a punch card at a coffee shop. The difference is that credit card rewards programs use far more sophisticated financial tools and technology to create a vastly more intricate system that stacks the deck in favor of companies’ bottom lines. Take Starbucks and Dunkin’, which run two of the country’s largest retail rewards programs. Starbucks boasts over thirty million users, while Dunkin’ claims over ten million. Both programs reward customers with a free coffee if they preload a certain amount of money onto their digital rewards apps, to be used at the stores’ locations. The total balances held across these digital apps have exploded, in Starbucks’ case to nearly $2 billion, larger than the balances managed by many small- and medium-sized banks — except without any of the same regulatory oversight. A significant portion of the clientele who sign up for these programs forget about their balances and never spend them. Customers have essentially placed their money in a savings account that accrues no interest, while giving these conglomerates an interest-free loan to use at the company’s discretion. If Starbucks or Dunkin’ ever experienced financial difficulties or went out of business, these digital funds could evaporate. That might not be as implausible as it sounds, considering how Wall Street firms have acquired and stripped once-powerful retail empires like Toys “R” Us for parts. When the private equity-backed bowling alley chain Bowlero merged with bowling competitor Lucky Strike and rebranded in 2023, the balances that customers had stored on their Bowlero rewards card vanished overnight. Loyalty reward scams aren’t the only problem with retail credit cards. For one thing, the cost of such credit cards is usually higher than that of non-retail cards. In 2024, 90 percent of retail credit cards had annual percentage rates (APR) above 30 percent, compared to just a third of other cards. According to government regulators, retail credit cards are, in general, among the most expensive credit options, thanks to their excessive fees and interest charges. These high fees are so important to the credit card companies that a Biden administration rule to cap late fees at $8 threatened to significantly cut into industry profits. The Chamber of Commerce, the country’s largest business lobbying group, immediately sued the agency to block the rule. To take advantage of these high fees, retailers are forcing their workers to become credit card salesmen. “Companies are enlisting low-wage workers to target other low-wage earners with predatory products,” said Frotman. At employers such as Macy’s and Kohl’s, retail workers’ compensation is reportedly dependent in part on hitting sales quotas for signing customers up for store credit cards. Such requirements have become the source of contract disputes during union bargaining at some stores. With their salaries on the line, retail workers are often forced to hawk cards to customers without adequate training to evaluate creditworthiness. For this reason, regulators have warned that the underwriting standards for retail cards are less stringent, which may be driving customers into bad deals and debt. “Does anyone think this is going to end well?” asked Frotman. On average, retail cardholders are more likely than other credit card customers to carry a balance and only pay the minimum monthly amount due, which increases the likelihood of going into debt, according to government findings. In health care, the peddling of credit cards can be even more exploitative, contributing to the nation’s ballooning medical debt crisis. For the millions of Americans who lack health insurance or aren’t fully covered, doctors and nurses are now offering these cards or other installment loans to help them pay their medical bills. While these cards were historically offered just for elective procedures, they’re increasingly being promoted for basic health expenses and medical emergencies. CareCredit from Synchrony Financial, one of the largest financial players in the medical space, now carries 11.7 million cardholders and lists over 250,000 health care partners. While medical credit cards can reduce care providers’ billing and administration costs, regulators have found that the sale of these cards often comes with minimal disclosure of the unforgiving terms, high rates, and other predatory practices. In some instances, the cards have been sold to patients whose procedures, unbeknownst to them, might have been covered by their insurance or nonprofit hospitals’ bill-forgiveness programs. “We transcribed phone calls that we had with hospitals to kind of show how they’re softly nudging people toward these payment products,” said Eli Rushbanks, the general counsel at the patient advocacy nonprofit Dollar For, which submitted a public comment in 2023 calling for a government inquiry into the matter. “We took screenshots of websites that really blend the ideas of what’s Medicaid, what’s charity care, and what’s a payment plan under just sort of a nebulous umbrella of financial assistance.” The American Prospect even reported that regulators have learned of instances in which patients had no memory of agreeing to use a medical credit card. It turned out that they had been signed up for the service while they were under anesthesia. In their quest to embrace embedded finance, companies are venturing into new, unregulated areas of banking and lending. Rideshare apps Uber and Lyft have developed company-issued debit cards, payment processing apps, and even in-house auto lending programs that they offer to their drivers. These payment services aren’t covered by the FDIC, and the lending arms have been taken to court for illegal, exploitative practices such as charging higher interest rates than the industry average. All of these financial arrangements threaten to lock rideshare workers into their jobs, as their employer serves as their de facto banker. Amazon similarly began offering workers a product called “earned wage access,” which lends them their salary before payday, putting them in debt to their boss. The earned-wage-access industry has been criticized for exploiting low-income workers by charging steep penalties for late payments. Most prominently, big-box retailers and grocery stores are increasingly offering “buy now, pay later” options at checkout, providing consumers short-term financing for purchases that they often can’t afford. Buy now, pay later is a short-term financing option that provides smaller loans to be paid back in incremental installments. Sometimes promoted as zero-interest loans, buy now, pay later options often involve costly late fees and sneaky terms that can saddle borrowers with sky-high interest rates if they don’t pay off the loan on time. While buy now, pay later programs often charge merchants higher transaction fees than credit cards, nearly all major chain stores now offer the option because it helps generate more sales. A number of companies, including Costco, are now integrating buy now, pay later options from providers like Affirm, Klarna, and Afterpay directly into their websites and apps to capture a larger share of the resulting revenues. These deals encourage retailers to push a largely unregulated financial product. Over a quarter of all Americans now use buy now, pay later programs, and according to a recent survey from LendingTree, roughly 25 percent of those customers regularly use the option to pay for basic items like groceries. Even more concerning, 40 percent of buy now, pay later borrowers reported missing at least one of their installment payments, leading to late fees. “The marketing of buy now, pay later loans can make them appear to be a zero-risk credit option,” read a 2022 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau report identifying “several areas of risk of consumer harm.” The report concluded that borrowers with buy now, pay later plans were more likely “to be highly indebted,” to “have delinquencies in traditional credit products,” and to exhibit “high levels of financial distress.” The agency’s assessment also noted that buy now, pay later lenders may be engaging in a form of “regulatory arbitrage” by strategically operating in the shadows and avoiding stricter legal standards imposed on other financial markets. Along with preying on consumers, embedded finance also targets small, independent businesses. Fintech companies such as Shopify, PayPal, and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s Square offer business-management services for nascent enterprises, including transaction processing, one of the biggest logjams in digital retail. But these benefits come with a catch: The platforms steer small businesses toward merchant cash advances, a virtually unregulated financial service that’s been accused of exploitative practices. Merchant cash advances provide businesses with lines of credit, but instead of expecting direct reimbursement, lenders take a fixed percentage of the businesses’ sales until the end of the loan term. By arguing that their product is not a loan covered by financial regulations but rather an investment in their borrowers’ business, merchant cash advance providers are free to saddle businesses with exorbitantly high payments and avoid state caps on excessive interest charges. America’s long-standing efforts to separate banking and commerce haven’t kept up with the breakneck growth of nonbank financial institutions. While these businesses engage in many of the same kinds of lending as banks, they don’t accept traditional commercial deposits. That means they’re not subject to the same regulatory oversight from banking authorities tasked with protecting consumers from financial risk. The digital app Juno, for example, advertised itself as a “complete replacement for banking” with better savings rates — except without consumer protections like FDIC insurance. So when Synapse, a software company that Juno relied on for back-end tech services, collapsed in 2024, many Juno customers lost their entire savings. During the Biden administration, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other agencies pursued a range of actions and investigations aimed at mitigating the risks associated with the burgeoning embedded-finance market. Government investigators probed predatory practices in retail credit cards, medical debt loans, buy now, pay later services, and digital payment apps. Some of the probes led to new regulations, such as a 2024 rule that extended financial regulators’ supervisory authority to Big Tech payment platforms and regulated them as strictly as banks. That rule drew ire from the tech industry and was immediately terminated by the Trump administration, along with a host of other Biden-era financial reforms. Since then, one of the country’s top financial watchdogs, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has been systematically dismantled under the direction of the White House. The Trump administration has even indicated it will reopen applications for industrial loan companies, the auto industry–owned banks that played a role in the 2008 financial crisis. The news inspired each of the country’s Big Four auto companies to file new applications to operate their own banks. The result is that consumers have been left to navigate the strange new world of bankification on their own — with troubling consequences. Take Paula, a Florida resident, who had to undergo an emergency dental procedure that cost thousands of dollars. Her insurer wouldn’t cover it, so her dental practice recommended she sign up for a CareCredit payment plan to afford the bill. According to a public comment letter submitted to consumer regulators by the advocacy group Consumer Reports on her behalf, Paula paid the requested amount each month — but when the plan’s zero-interest promotional period expired, she still had a remaining balance of $700, so interest payments kicked in. The following month, Paula’s bill doubled to $1,400. It turned out that thanks to Care Credit’s unregulated fine print, the company charged interest on the total up-front cost of her medical bill, rather than her remaining balance. For Paula, the frictionless convenience offered by embedded finance wasn’t a panacea — it was a debt trap. As she put it bluntly in her comment letter, “I would rather be in pain and suffer than pay the exorbitant interest charged to me.” This article was first published by the Lever, an award-winning independent investigative newsroom.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. GOOGL stock is up 32% this year, benefiting from a stock rerating post-regulatory victory on its Chrome browser and strong tailwinds from AI demand. Despite this impressive performance, we believe that its peer, META stock, is now a more compelling investment choice. Why? Meta is Google’s counterpart in the Interactive Media & Services sector that possesses: This discrepancy between valuation and actual performance indicates that buying META stock may be more beneficial than picking GOOGL stock at current levels. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like GOOGL or META, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. OpInc = Operating Income, P/OpInc = Price To Operating Income Ratio However, do these figures reveal the entire picture? Read Buy or Sell GOOGL Stock to determine whether GOOGL maintains a competitive edge beneath the surface. To provide context, GOOGL offers a wide range of products and services that include advertisements, Android, Chrome, hardware, cloud solutions, health technology, and internet services across multiple sectors. A way to evaluate if GOOGL stock is currently overpriced compared to the other stocks would involve comparing these metrics from a year ago. If there has been a significant shift in GOOGL’s trend in the past 12 months, it is possible that the current discrepancy might revert. On the contrary, a continuous underperformance in revenue and operating income growth for GOOGL would bolster the viewpoint that the stock is indeed overpriced relative to its competitors, but may not correct itself in the near term. Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Sarah Keohane Williamson is the Chief Executive Officer of FCLTGlobal, a non-profit research organization whose mission is to focus capital on the long term to support a sustainable and prosperous economy. Under her leadership, FCLTGlobal develops innovative, practical research and builds a global community of CEOs focused on solving long-term challenges across the investment value chain. She is the author of "The CEO’s Guide to the Investment Galaxy." Record levels of private capital and the recent and rapid rise of VC-funded unicorns suggest to some that public markets are a thing of the past, a holdover from the capitalism of yesteryear. Financial news of the past two decades is littered with stories of companies delaying IPOs and growing despite it — Meta, Uber, Airbnb and the like. Some still remain private, most notably Elon Musk’s SpaceX. If they can find success without going public, why should anyone else? Take the example of Klarna — a 20-year-old company — which recently had a successful IPO on the NYSE, with a nice pop on its first day. Why would a company like Klarna choose to go public? Public companies have to deal with public investors, follow specific rules on governance, and disclose extensive information. Klarna had no trouble accessing private capital in the past. Surely some of their original backers were looking for liquidity, but there is plenty of private liquidity around if that is all they need. Many companies have decided that the private markets are a better place to be. Over the last couple of decades, the number of listed companies and new IPOs in developed markets has dropped dramatically. The rigor and scrutiny of being publicly traded, and the perceived pressures that come with opening up the shareholder roll, are burdens many companies would prefer to avoid. So why go public? The answer is that there are great benefits to being a listed company in a deep, global market. While there are plenty of capital options besides going public, public markets help companies grow up. That discipline and credibility, as well as the opportunity for founders, employees, and investors to benefit from the value created, still make public markets the destination of choice. And while listings did indeed drop over the past 30 or so years, in that same timeframe, global public market capitalization rose to over $90 trillion, or about 112% of global GDP. Public markets aren’t dead — they’re just misunderstood. The idea that companies must choose between the quarterly spin cycle and the refuge of private markets is a myth. With the right strategy and the right investors, public companies still deliver superior long-term value. It’s true, public companies spend a lot of time on the quarter — hitting or missing targets, talking to the Street, etc. But the reality is that providing estimates of your next quarter’s earnings only encourages traders to make short-term bets and increases the volatility of your stock price. It’s a habit, not a requirement. The best companies recognize that such a myopic focus on the quarterly cycle is a distraction from building a great business. To avoid it, most companies don’t issue quarterly earnings guidance anymore; by 2024, only 21% of S&P 500 companies were still doing so, down from 36% in 2010. Public companies have plenty of opportunities to talk to the investment community. But “investors” are not a monolith, something many CEOs find out too late. They have different horizons and incentives; some are seeking durable returns over decades, while others are simply looking for alpha. This is not criticism. It’s reality. But evidence shows that an increase in short-term, transient investors is associated with cuts to long-term investments (R&D, marketing, etc.) in order to increase short-term earnings, leading to temporary boosts in equity valuations that reverse over time. While CEOs can’t bar investors from buying stock in the public markets, they can have an investor strategy that tries to attract the best long-term investors by understanding their time frames and incentives. Companies that find success in this regard employ several key tactics: they engage consistently with large shareholders throughout the year (rather than limiting interactions to AGM seasons). They deploy CEO and board-level leadership for key shareholder meetings and, importantly, align IR professional incentives with long-term shareholder success metrics rather than short-term sell-side ratings. This comprehensive approach reduces an emphasis on 90-day cycles, creates deeper shareholder support, and unlocks mutual value for both investors and public companies. To be sure, there are advantages to staying private for companies in certain circumstances. But public markets remain an unmatched source of capital, credibility, and the opportunity to scale. It’s time to stop viewing them as a necessary evil and instead as a strategic asset — as long as companies can navigate them with intent and with the right strategies in place. Public companies aren’t dying, but CEOs who don’t adapt their investor strategy will.

ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. The strain on the U.S. air traffic control system could be key to ending the government shutdown. Air traffic controllers are working an average of 60 hours a week without pay, the head of their union told Forbes, at a time when there’s already a severe shortage of air traffic controllers. While they are considered essential and must continue to work during a shutdown, absenteeism and attrition reportedly played a key role in President Donald Trump’s decision to end the shutdown in 2018-19. “In a job that’s already stressful, this shutdown has put way more stress on our controllers,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told reporters Monday. AMD announced a multibillion-dollar deal with ChatGPT creator OpenAI, leading shares of the chipmaker to soar 24% on Monday as the company seeks to challenge Nvidia’s dominance. AMD gave OpenAI the option to purchase up to 160 million shares, representing an estimated 10% stake in the firm. President Donald Trump’s $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa recipients is expected to hit universities hard, adding to higher education’s woes amid research funding cuts and freezes and new student loan limits set to kick in next year. The Trump Administration is also proposing changing the rules of the visa lottery to favor older workers, which would make it harder for foreign students who graduate from U.S. universities to stay in the country for work. Shares of AppLovin tumbled Monday as the SEC launched a probe into alleged data-collection violations tied to targeted ads, according to Bloomberg. The mobile advertising company’s stock dropped 14% following reports of the investigation, erasing an estimated $8.65 billion in executive and top pre-IPO investor wealth, according to Forbes estimates. ChatGPT users will soon be able to connect to third-party apps, such as Spotify or Zillow, while using the chatbot, parent company OpenAI’s latest innovation as it competes in the race for AI dominance. CEO Sam Altman said Monday that users will be able to perform functions like creating a playlist in Spotify or searching for a specific style of home through Zillow. Illinois challenged the Trump Administration over its efforts to deploy the National Guard in Chicago over the weekend, joining California and Oregon in suing over troop deployments. The district judge who was assigned the case did not immediately block the deployment and set oral arguments for Thursday, though she did say that she was “very troubled by the lack of answers” from Justice Department attorneys, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. Hours after the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of the criminal conviction of former Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, Trump told reporters that he would have to speak with the Justice Department before commenting on a possible pardon. “I haven’t heard the name in so long, I can say this—I’d have to take a look at it,” the president said Monday. The NHL’s ten highest-paid players are expected to bring in an estimated $167 million combined this season—8% more than last year’s record $156 million, as the league-wide outlook improves. Topping the list for the second year in a row is Toronto Maple Leafs captain Auston Matthews, projected to rake in approximately $20.2 million this season from his playing contract as well as endorsements and other business endeavors. The Supreme Court began a new term Monday in which it is set to potentially rule on several key Trump Administration policies. The court will hear oral arguments next month on lawsuits challenging the president’s “Liberation Day” tariffs, and it will decide on whether Trump can fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook. Located on 170 acres along a lake southwest of Dallas Fort Worth airport, the championship-length Halbert National is the latest creation by legendary golf designer Tom Fazio. David D. Halbert, a new Forbes 400 member who spent some $50 million to build the par 72 track, owns 100% of the course. There is no membership, and only Halbert’s friends and family can play the course. The total price of Halbert’s satisfaction will be upwards of $70 million once he’s built out a lodge and acquired neighboring lots. “I want it to be nicer than Augusta,” says Halbert. He can afford it. This is Halbert’s first year on the Forbes 400. In March the biotech he founded, Caris Life Sciences, went public, quickly surging to a market cap of $10.3 billion. He owns 44%, good for a net worth of $4.9 billion. WHY IT MATTERS Although it’s fairly uncommon, other billionaires have built private golf courses, including Warren Stephens (net worth: $3.5 billion), whose Alotian course in Little Rock, Arkansas, is another Fazio masterpiece. Kelcy Warren (net worth: $7.3 billion), of pipeline giant Energy Transfer, owns the Lajitas course on the Rio Grande in west Texas. Ted Turner ($2.8 billion) has a course on his 9,000-acre Nonami Ranch in Georgia. Michael Jordan ($3.8 billion) built his Grove XXIII course on a former citrus plantation in Florida and has personally approved only a handful of members. MORE Forbes 400 As luxury watch brands target the nation’s wealthiest, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and social media star Jake Paul recently sported multimillion-dollar watches at combat sport events: 714: The number of natural emeralds in the Jacob & Co. Billionaire III worn by Paul at a September press conference As much as $2 million: The amount that similar timepieces to those worn by Zuckerberg at a UFC 320 event in Las Vegas have sold for About two dozen: How many “Billionaire” watches Jacob and Co. has made since 2015 As fewer professionals jump ship amid the era of the “Great Stay,” it’s important to remember that you don’t have to change employers to find strategic growth opportunities. Start by addressing internal pain points on your team and asking for stretch assignments. You can also take advantage of professional development benefits your company may offer and work on building an internal network. Bari Weiss’ media startup The Free Press will be acquired in a deal worth $150 million. As part of the deal, Weiss will become editor-in-chief of which media outlet? A. CBS News B. NBC News C.

Title: OpenAI’s Windows Play

Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Latest Podcast Listen to Podcast Listen to this post: OpenAI’s flood of announcements are getting hard to keep up with. A selection — not exhaustive! — from just the last month: The last two announcements just dropped yesterday, and actually bring clarity and coherence to the entire list. In short, OpenAI is making a play to be the Windows of AI. For nearly two decades smartphones, and in particular iOS, have been the touchstones in terms of discussing platforms. It’s important to note, however, that while Apple’s strategy of integrating hardware and software was immensely profitable, it entailed leaving the door open for a competing platform to emerge. The challenge of being a hardware company is that by virtue of needing to actually create devices you can’t serve everyone; Apple in particular didn’t have the capacity or desire to go downmarket, which created the opportunity for Android to not only establish a competing platform but to actually significantly exceed iOS in market share. That means that if we want a historical analogy for total platform dominance — which increasingly appears to be OpenAI’s goal — we have to go back further to the PC era and Windows. Before there was Windows there was DOS; before DOS, however, there was a fast-talking deal-making entrepreneur named Bill Gates. From The Truth About Windows Versus the Mac: In the late 1970s and very early 1980s, a new breed of personal computers were appearing on the scene, including the Commodore, MITS Altair, Apple II, and more. Some employees were bringing them into the workplace, which major corporations found unacceptable, so IT departments asked IBM for something similar. After all, “No one ever got fired for buying IBM.” IBM spun up a separate team in Florida to put together something they could sell IT departments. Pressed for time, the Florida team put together a minicomputer using mostly off-the shelf components; IBM’s RISC processors and the OS they had under development were technically superior, but Intel had a CISC processor for sale immediately, and a new company called Microsoft said their OS — DOS, which they acquired from another company — could be ready in six months. For the sake of expediency, IBM decided to go with Intel and Microsoft. The rest, as they say, is history. The demand from corporations for IBM PCs was overwhelming, and DOS — and applications written for it — became entrenched. By the time the Mac appeared in 1984, the die had long since been cast. Ultimately, it would take Microsoft a decade to approach the Mac’s ease-of-use, but Windows’ DOS underpinnings and associated application library meant the Microsoft position was secure regardless. There is nothing like IBM and its dominant position in enterprise today; rather, the route to becoming a platform is to first be a massively popular product. Acquiring developers and users is not a chicken-and-egg problem: it is clear that you must get users first, which attracts developers, enhancing your platform in a virtuous cycle; to put it another way, first a product must Aggregate users and then it gets developers for free. ChatGPT is exactly that sort of product, and at yesterday’s DevDay 2025 keynote CEO Sam Altman and team demonstrated exactly that sort of pull; from The Verge: OpenAI is introducing a way to work with apps right inside ChatGPT. The idea is that, from within a conversation with the chatbot, you can essentially tag in apps to help you complete a task while ChatGPT offers context and advice. The company showed off a few different ways this can work. In a live demo, an OpenAI employee launched ChatGPT and then asked Canva to create a poster of a name for a dog-walking business; after a bit of waiting, Canva came back with a few different examples, and the presenter followed up by asking for a generated pitch deck based on the poster. The employee also asked Zillow via ChatGPT to show homes for sale in Pittsburgh, and it created an interactive Zillow map — which the employee then asked follow-up questions about. Apps available inside ChatGPT starting today will include Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Expedia, Figma, Spotify, and Zillow. In the “weeks ahead,” OpenAI will add more apps, such as DoorDash, OpenTable, Target, and Uber. OpenAI recently started allowing ChatGPT users to make purchases on Etsy through the chatbot, part of its overall push to integrate it with the rest of the web. It’s fair to wonder if these app experiences will measure up to these company’s self-built apps or websites, just as there are questions about just how well the company’s Instant Checkout will convert; what is notable, however, is that I disagree that this represents a “push to integrate…with the rest of the web”. This is the opposite: this is a push to make ChatGPT the operating system of the future. Apps won’t be on your phone or in a browser; they’ll be in ChatGPT, and if they aren’t, they simply will not exist for ChatGPT users. That, by extension, means the burden of making these integrations work — and those conversions performant — will be on third party developers, not OpenAI. This is the power that comes from owning users, and OpenAI is flexing that power in a major way. There is a second aspect to the IBM PC strategy, and that is the role of AMD. From a 2024 Update: While IBM chose Intel to provide the PC’s processor, they were wary of being reliant on a single supplier (it’s notable that IBM didn’t demand the same of the operating system, which was probably a combination of not fully appreciating operating systems as a point of integration and lock-in for 3rd-party software, which barely existed at that point, and a recognition that software is just bits and not a physical good that has to be manufactured). To that end IBM demanded that Intel license its processor to another chip firm, and AMD was the obvious choice: the firm was founded by Jerry Sanders, a Fairchild Semiconductor alum who had worked with Intel’s founders, and specialized in manufacturing licensed chips. The relationship between Intel and AMD ended up being incredibly fraught and largely documented by endless lawsuits (you can read a brief history in that Update); the key point to understand, however, is that (1) IBM wanted to have dual suppliers to avoid being captive to an essential component provider and (2) IBM had the power to make that happen because they had the customers who were going to provide Intel so much volume. The true beneficiary of IBM’s foresight, of course, was Microsoft, which controlled the operating system; IBM’s mandate is why it is appropriate that “Windows” comes first in the “Wintel” characterization of the PC era. Intel reaped tremendous profits from its position in the PC value chain, but more value accrued to Microsoft than anyone else. This question of who will capture the most profit from the AI value chain remains an open one. There’s no question that the early winner is Nvidia: the company has become the most valuable in the world by virtue of its combination of best-in-class GPUs, superior networking, and CUDA software layer that locks people into Nvidia’s own platform. And, as long as power is the limiting factor, Nvidia is well-placed to maintain its position. What Nvidia is not shy about is capturing its share of value, and that is a powerful incentive for other companies in the value chain to look for alternatives. Google is the furthest along in this regard thanks to its decade-old investment in TPUs, while Amazon is seeking to mimic their strategy with Trainium; Microsoft and Meta are both working to design and build their own chips, and Apple is upscaling Apple Silicon for use in the data center. Once again, however, the most obvious and most immediately available alternative to Nvidia is AMD, and I think the parallels between yesterday’s announcement of an OpenAI-AMD deal and IBM’s strong-arming of Intel are very clear; from the Wall Street Journal: OpenAI and chip-designer Advanced Micro Devices announced a multibillion-dollar partnership to collaborate on AI data centers that will run on AMD processors, one of the most direct challenges yet to industry leader Nvidia. Under the terms of the deal, OpenAI committed to purchasing 6 gigawatts worth of AMD’s chips, starting with the MI450 chip next year. The ChatGPT maker will buy the chips either directly or through its cloud computing partners. AMD chief Lisa Su said in an interview Sunday that the deal would result in tens of billions of dollars in new revenue for the chip company over the next half-decade. The two companies didn’t disclose the plan’s expected overall cost, but AMD said it costs tens of billions of dollars per gigawatt of computing capacity. OpenAI will receive warrants for up to 160 million AMD shares, roughly 10% of the chip company, at 1 cent per share, awarded in phases, if OpenAI hits certain milestones for deployment. AMD’s stock price also has to increase for the warrants to be exercised. If OpenAI is the software layer that matters to the ecosystem, then Nvidia’s long-term pricing power will be diminished; the company, like Intel, may still take the lion’s share of chip profits through sheer performance and low-level lock-in, but I believe the most important reason OpenAI is making this deal is to lock in its own dominant position in the stack. It is pretty notable that this announcement comes only weeks after Nvidia’s investment in OpenAI; that, though, is another affirmation that the company who has the users has the ultimate power. There is one other part of the stack to keep an eye on: TSMC. Both Nvidia and AMD make their chips with the Taiwanese giant, and while TSMC is famously reticent to take price, they are positioned to do so in the long run. Altman surely knows this as well, which means that I wouldn’t be surprised if there is an Intel announcement sooner rather than later; maybe there is fire to that recent smoke about AMD talking with Intel? When I started writing Stratechery, Windows was a platform in decline, superceded by mobile and, surprisingly enough, increasingly challenged by its all-but-vanquished ancient foe, the Mac. To that end, one of my first pieces about Microsoft was about then-CEO Steve Ballmer’s misguided attempt to focus on devices instead of services. I wrote a few years later in Microsoft’s Monopoly Hangover: The truth is that both [IBM and Microsoft] were victims of their own monopolistic success: Windows, like the System/360 before it, was a platform that enabled Microsoft to make money in all directions. Both companies made money on the device itself and by selling many of the most important apps (and in the case of Microsoft, back-room services) that ran on it. There was no need to distinguish between a vertical strategy, in which apps and services served to differentiate the device, or a horizontal one, in which the device served to provide access to apps and services. When you are a monopoly, the answer to strategic choices can always be “Yes.” Microsoft at that point in time no longer had that luxury: the company needed to make a choice — the days of doing everything were over — and that choice should be services (which is exactly what Satya Nadella did). Ever since the emergence of ChatGPT made OpenAI The Accidental Consumer Tech Company I have been making similar arguments about OpenAI: they need to focus on the consumer opportunity and leave the enterprise API market to Microsoft. Not only would focus help the company capture the consumer opportunity, there was the opportunity cost of GPUs used for the API that couldn’t be used to deliver consumers a better experience across every tier. I now have much more appreciation for OpenAI’s insistence on doing it all, for two reasons. First, this is a company in pure growth mode, not in decline. Tradeoffs are in the long run inevitable, but why make them before you need to? It would have been a mistake for Microsoft to restrict Windows to only the enterprise in the 1980s, even if the company had to low-key retreat from the consumer market over the last fifteen years; there was a lot of money to make before that retreat needed to happen! OpenAI, meanwhile, is the hottest brand in AI, so why not make a play to own it all, from consumer touchpoint to API to everything in-between? Second, we’ve obviously crossed the line into bubble territory, which always was inevitable. The question now is whether or not this is a productive bubble: what durable infrastructure will be built by eventually bankrupt companies that we benefit from for years to come? GPUs are not that durable infrastructure; data centers are more long-lasting, but not worth the financial pain of a bubble burst. The real payoff would be a massive build-out in power generation, which would be a benefit for the next half a century. Another potential payoff would be the renewed viability of Intel, and as I noted above, OpenAI may be uniquely positioned and motivated to make that happen. More broadly, this play to be the Windows of AI effectively positions OpenAI as the linchpin of the entire AI buildout. Just look at what the mere announcement of partnerships with OpenAI has done for the stocks of Oracle and AMD. OpenAI is creating the conditions such that it is the primary manifestation of the AI bubble, which ensures the company is the primary beneficiary of all of the speculative capital flooding into the space. Were the company more focused, as I have previously advised, they may not have the leverage to get enough funding to meet those more modest (but still incredible) goals; now it’s hard to see them not getting whatever money they want, at least until the bubble bursts. What’s amazing about this overview is that I only scratched the surface of what OpenAI announced both yesterday and over the last month — and I haven’t even mentioned Sora (although I covered that topic yesterday). What the company is seeking to achieve is incredibly audacious, but also logical, and something we’ve seen before: And, interestingly enough, there is an Apple to OpenAI’s Microsoft: it’s Google, with their fully integrated stack, from chips to data centers to models to end user distribution channels. Instead of taking on a menagerie of competitors, however, Google is facing an increasingly unified ecosystem, organized, whether they wish to be or not, around OpenAI. Such is the power of aggregating demand and the phenomenon that is ChatGPT. Get notified about new Articles Please verify your email address to proceed.

Title: The Autistic Half-Century
URL: https://www.thediff.co/archive/the-autistic-half-century/
Time Published: 2025-10-07T05:47:01Z
Full Content:
In this issue: 2025 has been a good year for valedictory memoirs from some of the 20th century's great executives, like Bill Gates' Source Code and John Malone's Born to be Wired. Gates has a few cameos in Malone's book, as a business partner and investor. One reason the two of them got along pretty well is that they had something in common: each one notes, early in his memoir, that he's autistic, and that his life (and his parents'!) would have been easier if he'd known that earlier. When people talk about "autism," they're describing a wide spectrum of outcomes, including pretty serious disabilities that prevent severely autistic people from living on their own. When they use the term to describe themselves, they're referring to the more benign part—a combination of poor social skills, odd sensitivities (to food, texture, noise, etc.), and the ability-or-compulsion to focus for long periods on very narrow domains.[1] For the purpose of this piece, by "autistic" I'm generally referring to the part of the spectrum where people can hold down jobs and live independently, and not the more severe varieties. This used to be called Aspergers, but that incredibly useful, motte-and-baily-crushing distinction has been deprecated for some reason. This set of traits has existed for a long time; Heraclides of Pontus describes the maritime equivalent of being obsessed with trains in the 4th century BC. Isaac Newton was a vividly weird guy who spent more time on biblical and alchemical studies than on math and physics. (He was also a very literal, subtext-insensitive kind of person; he got a sinecure as Master of the Mint partly because the government wanted to reward him for his academic contributions, but insisted on actually doing the job, hunting down counterfeiters, etc.) One reason to suspect that many public figures have an autistic streak is a two-sided selection effect: they're more often in circumstances where it's natural and normal for them to do what would otherwise be autistic. Describe Warren Buffett as someone who periodically has six-hour Q&A sessions with complete strangers, and he sounds pretty extroverted, but if you rephrase that as six hours of continuous riffing on a topic that's been his fixation since he was a teenager, and it sounds more like an autistic person who's been able to arrange his life so it's as autism-friendly as possible. The way I'd think of it is that if there's someone who spends forty hours a week messing around with model trains, they sound pretty autistic. But if you meet that person because you're at a model train convention, 1) it's 100% on-topic for them to start up a conversation with you by talking about model trains, and 2) you're already about 99th percentile for being interested in model trains, so they just don't look that weird to you. Similarly, lots of the people who strike up conversations with Gates or Malone are people who want to talk about their special interests. And when they were doing deals for set-to boxes and equity injections, a maximum-bandwidth bidirectional infodump was probably great fun for both of them. What would someone born with those traits have done if they'd been born a century earlier? There were certainly plenty of careers that reward this bundle of traits. But they were less scalable. Presumably lots of mildly autistic people sorted themselves into more solitary, systematized career tracks, and many others were part of the vast majority of people who lived on farms. Urbanization creates opportunities for more specialization, which raises the potential returns of spending basically all of your brainpower thinking about what you specialize in. (The Pattern Seekers is not all that great, but it does mention some anecdotes from the early life of Thomas Edison, who did very well for himself in terms of historical impact and had financial outcomes that weren't too shabby, either. So he was an early beneficiary of this: more cities meant more demand for power plants, lightbulbs, and appliances.) Mass production and capital accumulation raised the returns for people who can think about complex systems, as did logistics networks like railroads—a business where day-to-day management could mean lots of interaction with telegraph machines (Carnegie’s first love, he could understand the incoming clicks by sound alone) rather than human beings, and a field that rewarded people who were good at mental arithmetic and could keep lots of datapoints in their heads. But the period where traits on the spectrum were maximally rewarded probably starts in the 70s, thanks to a series of mostly unrelated developments: The analog world is built around neurotypical preferences. How could it not be? If you hate how bad and loud the music is in various public places, remember that these places are made for the public, and that's basically what the public wants. The digital world is built by and for autistic people, and if you want The Internet to be a place where you spend all of your time reading about Rust, or the Eastern Roman Empire, or certain practical applications of matrix multiplication, you can more or less arrange your online life so these are all mainstream interests. This framing even describes some of the conflicts that modern tech companies have engendered. People complain about The Algorithm showing them rage-bait news, snuff films from Ukraine, scantily-clad women, scantily-clad men, etc. But The Algorithm is, basically, whatever you seem likely to engage with based on your past behaviors and those similar to you. The neurotypical user says "This isn't what I wanted," and the autistically accurate response is "But it's exactly what you asked for." You should expect this to get more common. Autism diagnosis rates have risen over time, so in terms of pure numbers they'll have a bigger impact. Part of the rise of autism is just that we have better diagnostic tools. Malone and Gates probably received informal diagnosis of autism-spectrum disorders on the playground, in the form of being called a "geek" or "spaz" or something, and at least some of the growth of autism as an identification is that it's not as pejorative as it used to be. But it's also quite heritable, so if people with autistic traits start being more likely to have kids together—perhaps because of assortative mating by education, which rose from the mid-20th century through the 90s before declining; perhaps because couples are meeting online;[3] Autistic couples are also more likely to read Bryan Caplan, take him as gospel, maybe run a few monte carlo simulations, and commit themselves to maximizing the net present value of future visits-from-the-grandkids; maybe they nerd out about religion and read-and-reason their way into believing that any form of birth control is intrinsically evil.[4][5] If the material rewards from these traits keep rising, they won't be as economically constrained as other couples: fertility rates tend to be u-shaped with respect to income, and higher within-couple variance lowers the opportunity cost of one parent downshifting their career for a while. The Internet, the more autism-first way of viewing the world, is increasingly interposed between you and the external world. You'll still talk IRL—about things you read about online. You go out to restaurants—that you saw on Google Maps. As smart glasses get more common and interactions with LLMs get more ubiquitous, an increasing share of reality will be filtered through consumer apps, meaning that everything you see will be filtered by an autistic person's idea of what a neurotypical person would like. So, in the end, there's a paradoxical separation that leads to synthesis. Someone who was born on the spectrum a century ago would probably have a slightly worse life because of it, and feel a bit separate from their peers. They might, through effort and luck, construct a wonderful life for themselves, but the world didn't provide a lot of the raw material to make that easy. Today, they're much more likely to get sorted into a peer group in which they're comparatively normal, and to be able to filter out some of the rough textures and annoyances of a 50th-percentile life. But in another sense, all this separation makes them more integrated with society than they've ever been. A disproportionate share of the software and hardware I used to write this article, and that you're using to read it, was produced by people on the spectrum. You are, in some tenuous but meaningful sense, interacting with all of them. And, mercifully, you aren't even attempting to make eye contact. An obvious question you might have here is: "Hey, Byrne, are you autistic?" I actually don't know, and at this point in my life I don't think it would be especially useful to spend time and money to find out whether the answer is "almost" or "slightly" or whatever. If I run down the list of symptoms, there are plenty of familiar ones, but then you run into the incommensurable life advice problem: maybe noticing when other people are bored by or annoyed with me is just as hard for everyone else, and I'm just lazy. On the other hand, it's pretty heritable, and one of my kids did get a formal diagnosis (of the interesting-tradeoff variety rather than the crippling-disability kind), and I've never had a serious relationship in which I wasn't asked if I was actually autistic. It is pretty helpful to know where on the spectrum your kids are, especially if your sense of a normal level of interest in human beings relative to objects and abstractions is not quite average. The lining/stacking-up-objects thing, for example, is real. For kids, the utility of a diagnosis is that they aren't able to arrange their life in an autism-friendly way, but their parents can, especially when they can wield a doctor's note to teachers and other authority figures. For adults, the main reason to care is that if you have some autism-spectrum traits, it's helpful to look up the full list in order to learn which other traits you have that, unbeknownst to you, are not actually universal. ↩︎ In addition, financing these shakier companies meant that there were economic rewards to coming up with clever restructuring plans when the bonds inevitably went sour. The First Junk Bond is a book-length treatment of the various financings, restructurings, exchanges, etc., that just one company, Texas International Co., went through in the early days of junk bonds. If you get a kick out of figuring out how to value an oil-denominated bond, or you have a photographic memory for who owns how much of which bond issue and which of those owners might either owe you a favor or accept an owed favor as compensation for a haircut on the value of their asset, you'd thrive in this environment. The upstanding and eminently clubbable gentlemen who ran the largest banks just couldn't compete. ↩︎ This one also probably selected more for autistic-autistic pairings in the pre-swipe era, when cameras weren't as good and a text-centric approach worked best. It will be interesting to see if autism rates are lower for children of the cohort that met after Tinderizing online dating apps A/B tested better than anything else. ↩︎ Granted, they might get equally into David Benatar instead. Societies develop cultural antibodies to antinatalism over time, for the obvious reason that any society that doesn't ceases to exist. Which means that you can safely refuse to engage with any particular antinatalist argument unless you happen to find it funny. If they're wrong, it's just a live look at something that's born a historical curiosity, since eventually anyone susceptible to these ideas won't leave descendants behind. And if they're right, well, central nervous systems first evolved half a billion years ago, so a few extra generations of meaningless suffering doesn't move the needle. ↩︎ Also, this is a long and accidental version of the Selfish Gene, where on-the-spectrum traits that would make someone in the 13th century feel a lot more at home living in a monastery—following a rigid schedule, adhering to a written list of rules, reading and writing theological tracts all day—now contributes to conferring a fertility advantage on the same set of genes. ↩︎ You're on the free list for The Diff.

OpenAI has modestly adjusted its projected cash needs through 2029, to $115bn from $35bn ($, The Information). AI bearishness takes two forms: the demand-side argument that the products just aren't that great and will never be that big a business, and the supply-side argument that AI is amazing but the space is too crowded and overcapitalized for anyone to make money. This update is actually net worse for the first argument, but helpful for the second: the reason OpenAI's projected losses are rising so fast is that their revenue numbers are rising fast. Every time revenue goes up, there will be another set of inputs where scale effects mean they're worth doing in-house. OpenAI had no business owning fabs or power plants a few years ago, or designing their own chips, but if doing that today means getting the compute and the power they need to meet the future demand they expect, then it's worth it. This shifts costs earlier in time, because it's creating a fixed cost to replace a variable cost. So far, OpenAI's growth is answering the demand-side question quite nicely, but they'll need to set a lot more scaling records to justify another $80bn in spending to get there. ASML has become a big strategic investor in Mistral. This is very fun from the perspective of commoditizing the complement: if there are more AI labs, there will be more demand for GPUs, and probably more skunkworks projects to develop custom chips. If some of those competing companies are open-weight, the factor that determines marginal cost for the cheapest models will be purely on the hardware (and power) side. So ASML is doing what it can to ensure that demand for the most semiconductor capital equipment is as high as possible, but also that the end market is as fragmented as possible. Anthropic has settled a class-action lawsuit for $1.5bn over their decision to pirate some of the half-million or so books they trained on. This works out to about $3k/book, or what a typical author would get if they moved another thousand or so copies of their book after having earned back their advance. This actually seems reasonably fair. Just as a ballpark, the collective very partial attention of all of the users of an LLM seems like it would be equivalent to selling around that many extra copies of a book. As AI companies get bigger, there will have to be more refined ways to think about how to split the upside from people providing training data, but there's a possible model where LLMs end up being an active subsidy for very niche writing, because it will have a hard time finding its audience in bookstores but can't help but find that same audience in the context of an LLM chat session. So far this year, 231 companies have gone public in the US, and 7 in the UK ($, FT). Which raises the question: how global should the stock market really be? Within countries, there's typically consolidation in listing venues over time; trades happen where there are already other trades happening. On the other hand, even within the US that leads to some frictional costs, and the financial industry professionals on the West Coast who get to the office before 5am might fondly wish that a few of the trillion-dollar West Coast-based companies they track were listed on the Pacific Stock Exchange, with West Coast hours, instead. That problem is a lot harder if Japanese and market professionals have to work the night shift to trade Japanese stocks. So there's still some regional gravity for exchanges. But many of the biggest companies in a given country are multinationals, and if the investor base is English-speaking and assets tend to get managed from the US, it's generally easier for these companies to have a US listing. So the same cultural and economic ties that make UK-based companies bigger than they'd otherwise be have, over time, turned the London Stock Exchange into something closer to a regional exchange. One of the drivers of private equity's growth is that they can lever up at the company level, and have a bunch of higher-volatility bets with capped downside, which makes their portfolio perform better. Levering a company is economically similar to owning an option on in, with the strike price equal to the value of the debt, and if that's combined with streamlining a company to focus on a narrower business, it can lead to some exciting returns (and a few blowups). but public markets can do that, too, and there's been a burst of spinoffs lately ($, WSJ). Because of how low fees have gotten and how liquid the assets in question are, diversification is cheaper for most investors than making single-name bets, which means the right structure for the market is have diversification at the portfolio level and to make each individual stock as focused and idiosyncratic as possible.

Join us Oct. 15-17 in Phoenix to connect with top media buyers Subscribe: Apple Podcasts • Spotify Ad tech isn’t an easy business. Just ask The Trade Desk. Once the crown jewel of the industry, The Trade Desk is presently having a rough go. Between missed revenue targets and rising competition from the likes of Amazon, cracks are starting to form in the company’s crown. For years, The Trade Desk was the premier platform, raking in enough spend to account for 33 consecutive quarters of meeting or beating expectations. Slowly, things started to change. Disgruntled media agency whispers around fees reached a fever pitch. Kokai, its AI-driven data platform upgrade, lost hype. Walmart split, ending the exclusive part of its partnership with The Trade Desk. Meanwhile, it seems Google and Amazon are looking to fill in any gaps The Trade Desk may leave open. “There was never any doubt that Amazon and Google were going to make a play for that part of the market with their DSPs,” said Seb Joseph, Digiday executive editor of news, on a recent episode of the Digiday Podcast. “It was just a question of when.” In this episode of the Digiday Podcast, Joseph and senior reporter of advertising technology Ronan Shields, join co-hosts Kimeko McCoy and Tim Peterson, to discuss the rise of The Trade Desk and the likelihood it’ll continue to hold its own in a changing DSP landscape. Also in this episode, OpenAI and Meta continue to fuel the AI arms race with AI-generated videos in TikTok-style feeds and Meta ups the ante by using chatbot data to target ads. Then, Paramount acquired Bari Weiss’ The Free Press and brought Weiss on as editor-in-chief of CBS News. Here are a few highlights from the conversation, which have been edited for length and clarity. The Trade Desk’s tough year Peterson: There were bubbling concerns of “is The Trade Desk the next too big player in the ad tech space?” This year, the Trade Desk is still pretty dominant, but that dominance has definitely been put in check by… not even the rise of Amazon’s DSP, but Amazon’s DSP seems to have shifted into a new gear this year… As we’re recording this, Amazon announced a partnership with Spotify to have Spotify’s video and audio inventory available for sale through the Amazon DSP. Meanwhile, The Trade Desk has just had a tough year. Joseph: The Trade Desk has definitely had a rough time of it, probably going as far back as 18 months. You could feel that pressure building last spring when Amazon rolled out ads on Prime Video. As we reported, that move alone threw a spotlight on the Amazon ad business. By contrast, it pushed The Trade Desk into a more vulnerable position. But the real shift came when The Trade Desk missed its Q4 2024 numbers. Increased competition Shields: [Walmart] was one of the big temple narratives they had as a big player. It’s that pinstripe movement that they appeared to be in because the growth of the Amazon DSP is coming forward. That was probably more of a blow to its stock price. Losing Walmart, it’s not going to bolster the confidence of the market, sadly. That’s for sure. Much of this decline in its market value is due to the emergence of the Amazon DSP. There’s a saying out there, “If Amazon is getting into your business, it’s time to get out of your business.” That’s a cautionary tale. Acquire or be acquired? Joseph: I don’t think you can rule it [The Trade Desk being acquired by the likes of OpenAI] out. OpenAI generated $4.3 billion in revenue, but burned through $2.5 billion in the first half of the year. The need to spin up an ads business gets more intense by the quarter. Going on the M&A trail is the way to do that. Despite the issues with The Trade Desk, it’s still a robust business.

Title: Why fears of a trillion-dollar AI bubble are growing

Time Published: 2025-10-06T23:16:09Z

By Seth Fiegerman, Carmen Reinicke, Bloomberg News For almost as long as the artificial intelligence boom has been in full swing, there have been warnings of a speculative bubble that could rival the dot-com craze of the late 1990s that ended in a spectacular crash and a wave of bankruptcies. Tech firms are spending hundreds of billions of dollars on advanced chips and data centers, not just to keep pace with a surge in the use of chatbots such as ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude, but to make sure they’re ready to handle a more fundamental and disruptive shift of economic activity from humans to machines. The final bill may run into the trillions. The financing is coming from venture capital, debt and, lately, some more unconventional arrangements that have raised eyebrows on Wall Street. Even some of AI’s biggest cheerleaders acknowledge the market is frothy, while still professing their belief in the technology’s long-term potential. AI, they say, is poised to reshape multiple industries, cure diseases and generally accelerate human progress. Yet never before has so much money been spent so rapidly on a technology that, for all its potential, remains somewhat unproven as a profit-making business model. Tech industry executives who privately doubt the most effusive assessments of AI’s revolutionary potential — or at least struggle to see how to monetize it — may feel they have little choice but to keep pace with their rivals’ investments or risk being out-scaled and sidelined in the future AI marketplace. When Sam Altman, the chief executive of ChatGPT maker OpenAI, announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure plan known as Stargate alongside other executives at the White House in January, the price tag triggered some disbelief. Since then, other tech rivals have ramped up spending, including Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, who has pledged to invest hundreds of billions in data centers. Not to be outdone, Altman has since said he expects OpenAI to spend “trillions” on AI infrastructure. To finance those projects, OpenAI is entering into new territory. In September, chipmaker Nvidia Corp. announced an agreement to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI’s data center buildout, a deal that some analysts say raises questions about whether the chipmaker is trying to prop up its customers so that they keep spending on its own products. The concerns have followed Nvidia, to varying degrees, for much of the boom. The dominant maker of AI accelerator chips has backed dozens of companies in recent years, including AI model makers and cloud computing providers. Some of them then use that capital to buy Nvidia’s expensive semiconductors. The OpenAI deal was far larger in scale. OpenAI has also indicated it could pursue debt financing, rather than leaning on partners such as Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp. The difference is that those companies have rock-solid, established businesses that have been profitable for many years. OpenAI expects to burn through $115 billion of cash through 2029, The Information has reported. Other large tech companies are also relying increasingly on debt to support their unprecedented spending. Meta, for example, turned to lenders to secure $26 billion in financing for a planned data center complex in Louisiana that it says will eventually approach the size of Manhattan. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group are also leading a loan of more than $22 billion to support Vantage Data Centers’ plan to build a massive data-center campus, Bloomberg News has reported. By 2030, AI companies will need $2 trillion in combined annual revenue to fund the computing power needed to meet projected demand, Bain & Co. said in a report released in September. Yet their revenue is likely to fall $800 billion short of that mark, Bain predicted. “The numbers that are being thrown around are so extreme that it’s really, really hard to understand them,” said David Einhorn, a prominent hedge fund manager and founder of Greenlight Capital. “I’m sure it’s not zero, but there’s a reasonable chance that a tremendous amount of capital destruction is going to come through this cycle.” In a sign of the times, there’s also a growing number of less proven firms trying to capitalize on the data center goldrush. Nebius, an Amsterdam-based cloud provider that split off from Russian internet giant Yandex in 2024, recently inked an infrastructure deal with Microsoft worth up to $19.4 billion. And Nscale, a little-known British data center company, is working with Nvidia, OpenAI and Microsoft on build-outs in Europe. Like some other AI infrastructure providers, Nscale previously focused on another frothy sector: cryptocurrency mining. The data center spending spree is overshadowed by persistent skepticism about the payoff from AI technology. In August, investors were rattled after researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that 95% of organizations saw zero return on their investment in AI initiatives. More recently, researchers at Harvard and Stanford offered a possible explanation for why. Employees are using AI to create “workslop,” which the researchers define as “AI generated work content that masquerades as good work, but lacks the substance to meaningfully advance a given task.” The promise of AI has long been that it would help streamline tasks and boost productivity, making it an invaluable asset for workers and one that corporations would pay top dollar for. Instead, the Harvard and Stanford researchers found the prevalence of workslop could cost larger organizations millions of dollars a year in lost productivity. AI developers have also been confronting a different challenge. OpenAI, Claude chatbot developer Anthropic and others have for years bet on the so-called scaling laws — the idea that more computing power, data and larger models will inevitably pave the way for greater leaps in the power of AI. Eventually, they say, these advances will lead to artificial general intelligence, a hypothetical form of the technology so sophisticated that it matches or exceeds humans in most tasks. Over the past year, however, these developers have experienced diminishing returns from their costly efforts to build more advanced AI. Some have also struggled to match their own hype. After months of touting GPT-5 as a significant leap, OpenAI’s release of its latest AI model in August was met with mixed reviews. In remarks around the launch, Altman conceded that “we’re still missing something quite important” to reach AGI. Those concerns are compounded by growing competition from China, where companies are flooding the market with competitive, low-cost AI models. While U.S. firms are generally still viewed as ahead in the race, the Chinese alternatives risk undercutting Silicon Valley on price in certain markets, making it harder to recoup the significant investment in AI infrastructure. There’s also the risk that the AI industry’s vast data center buildout, entailing a huge increase in electricity consumption, will be held back by the realities of strained national power networks. Sam Altman, the face of the current AI boom, has repeatedly acknowledged the risk of a bubble in recent months while maintaining his optimism for the technology. “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? In my opinion, yes,” he said in August. “Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes.” Altman and other tech leaders continue to express confidence in the roadmap toward AGI, with some suggesting it could be closer than skeptics think. “Developing superintelligence is now in sight,” Zuckerberg wrote in July, referencing an even more powerful form of AI that his company is aiming for. In the near term, some AI developers also say they need to drastically ramp up computing capacity to support the rapid adoption of their services. Altman, in particular, has stressed repeatedly that OpenAI remains constrained in computing resources as hundreds of millions of people around the world use its services to converse with ChatGPT, write code and generate images and videos. OpenAI and Anthropic have also released their own research and evaluations that indicate AI systems are having a meaningful impact on work tasks, in contrast to the more damning reports from outside academic institutions. An Anthropic report released in September found that roughly three quarters of companies are using Claude to automate work. The same month, OpenAI released a new evaluation system called GDPval that measures the performance of AI models across dozens of occupations. “We found that today’s best frontier models are already approaching the quality of work produced by industry experts,” OpenAI said in a blog post. “Especially on the subset of tasks where models are particularly strong, we expect that giving a task to a model before trying it with a human would save time and money.” So how much will customers eventually be willing to pay for these services? The hope among developers is that, as AI models improve and field more complex tasks on users’ behalf, they will be able to convince businesses and individuals to spend far more to access the technology. “I want the door open to everything,” OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar said in late 2024, when asked about a report that the company has discussed a $2,000 monthly subscription for its AI products. “If it’s helping me move about the world with literally a Ph.D.-level assistant for anything that I’m doing, there are certainly cases where that would make all the sense in the world.” In September, Zuckerberg said an AI bubble is “quite possible,” but stressed that his bigger concern is not spending enough to meet the opportunity. “If we end up misspending a couple of hundred billion dollars, I think that that is going to be very unfortunate, obviously,” he said in a podcast interview. “But what I’d say is I actually think the risk is higher on the other side.” Bubbles are economic cycles defined by a swift increase in market values to levels that aren’t supported by the underlying fundamentals. They’re usually followed by a sharp selloff — the so-called pop. A bubble often begins when investors get swept up in a speculative frenzy — over a new technology or other market opportunity — and pile in for fear of missing out on further gains. American economist Hyman Minsky identified five stages of a market bubble: displacement, boom, euphoria, profit-taking and panic. Bubbles are sometimes difficult to spot because market prices can become dislocated from real-world values for many reasons, and a sharp price drop isn’t always inevitable. And, because a crash is part of a bubble cycle, they can be hard to pinpoint until after the fact. Generally, bubbles pop when investors realize that the lofty expectations they had were too high. This usually follows a period of over-exuberance that tips into mania, when everyone is buying into the trend at the very top. What comes next is a usually a slow, prolonged selloff where company earnings start to suffer, or a singular event that changes the long-term view, sending investors dashing for the exits. There was some fear that an AI bubble had already popped in late January, when China’s DeepSeek upended the market with the release of a competitive AI model purportedly built at a fraction of the amount that top U.S. developers spend. DeepSeek’s viral success triggered a trillion-dollar selloff of technology shares. Nvidia, a bellwether AI stock, slumped 17% in one day. The DeepSeek episode underscored the risks of investing heavily in AI. But Silicon Valley remained largely undeterred. In the months that followed, tech companies redoubled their costly AI spending plans, and investors resumed cheering on these bets. Nvidia shares charged back from an April low to fresh records. It was worth more than $4 trillion by the end of September, making it the most valuable company in the world. As with today’s AI boom, the companies at the center of the dot-com frenzy drew in vast amounts of investor capital, often using questionable metrics such as website traffic rather than their actual ability to turn a profit. There were many flawed business models and exaggerated revenue projections. Telecommunication companies raced to build fiber-optic networks only to find the demand wasn’t there to pay for them. When it all crashed in 2001, many companies were liquidated, others absorbed by healthier rivals at knocked-down prices. Echoes of the dot-com era can be found in AI’s massive infrastructure build-out, sky-high valuations and showy displays of wealth. Venture capital investors have been courting AI startups with private jets, box seats and big checks. Many AI startups tout their recurring revenue as a key metric for growth, but there are doubts as to how sustainable or predictable those projections are, particularly for younger businesses. Some AI firms are completing multiple mammoth fundraisings in a single year. Not all will necessarily flourish. “I think there’s a lot of parallels to the internet bubble,” said Bret Taylor, OpenAI’s chairman and the CEO of Sierra, an AI startup valued at $10 billion. Like the dot-com era, a number of high-flying companies will almost certainly go bust. But in Taylor’s telling, there will also be large businesses that emerge and thrive over the long term, just as happened with Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google in the late 90s. “It is both true that AI will transform the economy, and I think it will, like the internet, create huge amounts of economic value in the future,” Taylor said. “I think we’re also in a bubble, and a lot of people will lose a lot of money.” Amazon Chairman Jeff Bezos said the spending on AI resembles an “industrial bubble” akin to the biotech bubble of the 1990s, but he still expects it to improve the productivity of “every company in the world.” There are also some key differences to the dot-com boom that market watchers point out, the first being the broad health and stability of the biggest businesses that are at the forefront of the trend. Most of the “Magnificent Seven” group of U.S. tech companies are long-established giants that make up much of the earnings growth in the S&P 500 Index. These firms have huge revenue streams and are sitting on large stockpiles of cash. Despite the skepticism, AI adoption has also proceeded at a rapid clip. OpenAI’s ChatGPT has about 700 million weekly users, making it one of the fastest growing consumer products in history. Top AI developers, including OpenAI and Anthropic, have also seen remarkably strong sales growth. OpenAI previously forecast revenue would more than triple in 2025 to $12.7 billion. While the company does not expect to be cash-flow positive until near the end of this decade, a recent deal to help employees sell shares gave it an implied valuation of $500 billion — making it the world’s most valuable company never to have turned a profit.

Yet their revenue is likely to fall $800 billion short of that mark, Bain predicted. “The numbers that are being thrown around are so extreme that it’s really, really hard to understand them,” said David Einhorn, a prominent hedge fund manager and founder of Greenlight Capital. “I’m sure it’s not zero, but there’s a reasonable chance that a tremendous amount of capital destruction is going to come through this cycle.” In a sign of the times, there’s also a growing number of less proven firms trying to capitalize on the data center goldrush. Nebius, an Amsterdam-based cloud provider that split off from Russian internet giant Yandex in 2024, recently inked an infrastructure deal with Microsoft worth up to $19.4 billion. And Nscale, a little-known British data center company, is working with Nvidia, OpenAI and Microsoft on build-outs in Europe. Like some other AI infrastructure providers, Nscale previously focused on another frothy sector: cryptocurrency mining. The data center spending spree is overshadowed by persistent skepticism about the payoff from AI technology. In August, investors were rattled after researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that 95% of organizations saw zero return on their investment in AI initiatives. More recently, researchers at Harvard and Stanford offered a possible explanation for why. Employees are using AI to create “workslop,” which the researchers define as “AI generated work content that masquerades as good work, but lacks the substance to meaningfully advance a given task.” The promise of AI has long been that it would help streamline tasks and boost productivity, making it an invaluable asset for workers and one that corporations would pay top dollar for. Instead, the Harvard and Stanford researchers found the prevalence of workslop could cost larger organizations millions of dollars a year in lost productivity. AI developers have also been confronting a different challenge. OpenAI, Claude chatbot developer Anthropic and others have for years bet on the so-called scaling laws — the idea that more computing power, data and larger models will inevitably pave the way for greater leaps in the power of AI. Eventually, they say, these advances will lead to artificial general intelligence, a hypothetical form of the technology so sophisticated that it matches or exceeds humans in most tasks. Over the past year, however, these developers have experienced diminishing returns from their costly efforts to build more advanced AI. Some have also struggled to match their own hype. After months of touting GPT-5 as a significant leap, OpenAI’s release of its latest AI model in August was met with mixed reviews. In remarks around the launch, Altman conceded that “we’re still missing something quite important” to reach AGI. Those concerns are compounded by growing competition from China, where companies are flooding the market with competitive, low-cost AI models. While U.S. firms are generally still viewed as ahead in the race, the Chinese alternatives risk undercutting Silicon Valley on price in certain markets, making it harder to recoup the significant investment in AI infrastructure. There’s also the risk that the AI industry’s vast data center buildout, entailing a huge increase in electricity consumption, will be held back by the realities of strained national power networks. Sam Altman, the face of the current AI boom, has repeatedly acknowledged the risk of a bubble in recent months while maintaining his optimism for the technology. “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? In my opinion, yes,” he said in August. “Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes.” Altman and other tech leaders continue to express confidence in the roadmap toward AGI, with some suggesting it could be closer than skeptics think. “Developing superintelligence is now in sight,” Zuckerberg wrote in July, referencing an even more powerful form of AI that his company is aiming for. In the near term, some AI developers also say they need to drastically ramp up computing capacity to support the rapid adoption of their services. Altman, in particular, has stressed repeatedly that OpenAI remains constrained in computing resources as hundreds of millions of people around the world use its services to converse with ChatGPT, write code and generate images and videos. OpenAI and Anthropic have also released their own research and evaluations that indicate AI systems are having a meaningful impact on work tasks, in contrast to the more damning reports from outside academic institutions. An Anthropic report released in September found that roughly three quarters of companies are using Claude to automate work. The same month, OpenAI released a new evaluation system called GDPval that measures the performance of AI models across dozens of occupations. “We found that today’s best frontier models are already approaching the quality of work produced by industry experts,” OpenAI said in a blog post. “Especially on the subset of tasks where models are particularly strong, we expect that giving a task to a model before trying it with a human would save time and money.” So how much will customers eventually be willing to pay for these services? The hope among developers is that, as AI models improve and field more complex tasks on users’ behalf, they will be able to convince businesses and individuals to spend far more to access the technology. “I want the door open to everything,” OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar said in late 2024, when asked about a report that the company has discussed a $2,000 monthly subscription for its AI products. “If it’s helping me move about the world with literally a Ph.D.-level assistant for anything that I’m doing, there are certainly cases where that would make all the sense in the world.” In September, Zuckerberg said an AI bubble is “quite possible,” but stressed that his bigger concern is not spending enough to meet the opportunity. “If we end up misspending a couple of hundred billion dollars, I think that that is going to be very unfortunate, obviously,” he said in a podcast interview. “But what I’d say is I actually think the risk is higher on the other side.” Bubbles are economic cycles defined by a swift increase in market values to levels that aren’t supported by the underlying fundamentals. They’re usually followed by a sharp selloff — the so-called pop. A bubble often begins when investors get swept up in a speculative frenzy — over a new technology or other market opportunity — and pile in for fear of missing out on further gains. American economist Hyman Minsky identified five stages of a market bubble: displacement, boom, euphoria, profit-taking and panic. Bubbles are sometimes difficult to spot because market prices can become dislocated from real-world values for many reasons, and a sharp price drop isn’t always inevitable. And, because a crash is part of a bubble cycle, they can be hard to pinpoint until after the fact. Generally, bubbles pop when investors realize that the lofty expectations they had were too high. This usually follows a period of over-exuberance that tips into mania, when everyone is buying into the trend at the very top. What comes next is a usually a slow, prolonged selloff where company earnings start to suffer, or a singular event that changes the long-term view, sending investors dashing for the exits. There was some fear that an AI bubble had already popped in late January, when China’s DeepSeek upended the market with the release of a competitive AI model purportedly built at a fraction of the amount that top U.S. developers spend. DeepSeek’s viral success triggered a trillion-dollar selloff of technology shares. Nvidia, a bellwether AI stock, slumped 17% in one day. The DeepSeek episode underscored the risks of investing heavily in AI. But Silicon Valley remained largely undeterred. In the months that followed, tech companies redoubled their costly AI spending plans, and investors resumed cheering on these bets. Nvidia shares charged back from an April low to fresh records. It was worth more than $4 trillion by the end of September, making it the most valuable company in the world. As with today’s AI boom, the companies at the center of the dot-com frenzy drew in vast amounts of investor capital, often using questionable metrics such as website traffic rather than their actual ability to turn a profit. There were many flawed business models and exaggerated revenue projections. Telecommunication companies raced to build fiber-optic networks only to find the demand wasn’t there to pay for them. When it all crashed in 2001, many companies were liquidated, others absorbed by healthier rivals at knocked-down prices. Echoes of the dot-com era can be found in AI’s massive infrastructure build-out, sky-high valuations and showy displays of wealth. Venture capital investors have been courting AI startups with private jets, box seats and big checks. Many AI startups tout their recurring revenue as a key metric for growth, but there are doubts as to how sustainable or predictable those projections are, particularly for younger businesses. Some AI firms are completing multiple mammoth fundraisings in a single year. Not all will necessarily flourish. “I think there’s a lot of parallels to the internet bubble,” said Bret Taylor, OpenAI’s chairman and the CEO of Sierra, an AI startup valued at $10 billion. Like the dot-com era, a number of high-flying companies will almost certainly go bust. But in Taylor’s telling, there will also be large businesses that emerge and thrive over the long term, just as happened with Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google in the late 90s. “It is both true that AI will transform the economy, and I think it will, like the internet, create huge amounts of economic value in the future,” Taylor said. “I think we’re also in a bubble, and a lot of people will lose a lot of money.” Amazon Chairman Jeff Bezos said the spending on AI resembles an “industrial bubble” akin to the biotech bubble of the 1990s, but he still expects it to improve the productivity of “every company in the world.” There are also some key differences to the dot-com boom that market watchers point out, the first being the broad health and stability of the biggest businesses that are at the forefront of the trend. Most of the “Magnificent Seven” group of U.S. tech companies are long-established giants that make up much of the earnings growth in the S&P 500 Index. These firms have huge revenue streams and are sitting on large stockpiles of cash. Despite the skepticism, AI adoption has also proceeded at a rapid clip. OpenAI’s ChatGPT has about 700 million weekly users, making it one of the fastest growing consumer products in history. Top AI developers, including OpenAI and Anthropic, have also seen remarkably strong sales growth. OpenAI previously forecast revenue would more than triple in 2025 to $12.7 billion. While the company does not expect to be cash-flow positive until near the end of this decade, a recent deal to help employees sell shares gave it an implied valuation of $500 billion — making it the world’s most valuable company never to have turned a profit.
