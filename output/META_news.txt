The Nasdaq Composite lost 3.07%, falling to 19,341.83, and the S&P 500 slid 1.46% to 6,012.28. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 289.33 points, or 0.65%, to close at 44,713.58. Gains in Apple, Johnson & Johnson and Travelers helped lift the 30-stock index. Last week, DeepSeek released R1, an open-source reasoning model that reportedly outperformed OpenAI's in several tests, and has climbed the charts at app stores. DeepSeek said the initial version of its large language model, launched in late December, cost less than $6 million to design. While Wall Street questions that figure, the startup's claims are nonetheless raising concerns that big AI models could be built out with much less investment. AI darling Nvidia dropped nearly 17%, Broadcom lost 17.4%, and AMD shed 6.4%. Microsoft lost 2.1%. Palantir was hit for 4.4%. Derivative plays from the AI buildout such as power providers also suffered. Constellation Energy lost nearly 21%, while Vistra dropped 28%. "It's a good example of selling first and asking questions later, and investors sort of feeling that valuations are a bit stretched for technology in general and for semiconductors in particular," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. "We're going to have volatility, especially when we're dealing with a richly valued market and exogenous events." On the other hand, a rotation into more defensive areas of the market helped ease Monday's losses. "What I've also been encouraged by is investors are not bailing out of stocks necessarily, but are rotating into the defensive areas, like consumer staples, health care, real estate," Stovall added. "The market at least seems to be coming back." Monday's sharp declines come as traders brace for a major week, with "Magnificent Seven" members Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Tesla and Apple all due to report their latest quarterly results. On top of that, the Federal Reserve will hold its first policy meeting of the year, deciding on the level of interest rates Wednesday. Fed funds futures are pricing in a 97% chance that the central bank leaves interest rates unchanged, according to CMEGroup's FedWatch Tool. Weighed down by a technology sell-off, the Nasdaq Composite ended Monday's session lower. The technology-dominated index slipped 3.07% to finish at 19,341.83. The S&P 500 shed 1.46% and closed at 6,012.28. The Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to add 289.33 points, or 0.65%, settling at 44,713.58. — Lisa Kailai Han Even with the Nasdaq Composite down more than 3%, there are some notable tech stocks on track to close higher on the day. Shares of Salesforce were higher by more than 3%. TakeTwo Interactive and Intuit rose more than 1%. Adobe, Service Now and Palo Alto Networks were also on track for modest gains. Those moves could be a sign that cheaper versions of AI models will shift the benefit to different tech stocks. "I think the market's read today, which I generally agree with, is this is good for anyone who uses AI in their business. This is a potential cost-takeout or margin expansion opportunity for companies that use AI," said John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds. — Jesse Pound The risk of tariffs on China from President Donald Trump over the next couple months may not be that significant, according to Barclays. "We think the likelihood of a tariff hike in Q1 is small as President Trump ordered the USTR to assess China's performance under the Phase One deal (due 1 April) and expressed an interest in visiting China," the bank wrote in a Monday note. That said, while Barclays thinks a tariff hike within the quarter isn't likely, it's still "too early to tell" regarding what could happen in the subsequent quarters. "A review of the timeline for US-China trade war 1.0 showed that it remains to be seen how the deal making could evolve and whether and when new tariff threats would materialize," the bank added. The forecast comes as Trump revealed last week that his team is discussing a 10% tariff on China and that the tariff could be imposed as soon as Feb. 1. He had previously vowed to raise tariffs by an additional 10% on all Chinese goods back in November last year. — Sean Conlon The march of a new artificial intelligence lab in China stole a step from the market on Monday, but the number of advancing stocks still outnumbered decliners on the New York Stock Exchange in late day trading, 1481 to 1261. What's more, the number of new NYSE 52-week highs swamped new lows, 73 to 18, according to FactSet data. To be sure, declining volume accounted for nearly 55% of all NYSE volume Monday against advancing volume of 45%. But the numbers were grimmer still on the Nasdaq, where decliners swamped advancers 2565 to 1636, new lows beat new highs 133 to 109 and declining volume accounted for 71% of all shares traded. — Scott Schnipper Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, sees two more rate cuts on the horizon for 2025. "Our base case is that they cut interest rates twice this year, once in the second quarter, and then once again in the fourth quarter," he told CNBC in a Monday interview. As for this Wednesday's FOMC meeting, Stovall is in agreement with many investors who believe that the U.S. central bank will most likely hold rates steady. — Lisa Kailai Han Stifel sees three risks developing this year to threaten the current bull market rally. "First, although some investors expect a smooth hand-off from Growth-led to Value-led (from P/E to EPS), history and our economic views suggest otherwise. Second, we see Core PCE inflation stuck at 2.7% to 2.9% y/y in 2025, implying little possibility of rate cuts until GDP weakens," wrote chief equity strategist Barry Bannister. As the last negative development, Bannister pointed to an elevated U.S. Treasury 10-year yield resulting from policy and inflation, which implies that U.S. economic data could soon weaken. — Lisa Kailai Han Despite today's market selloff, Deutsche Bank believes that stocks remain relatively resilient. "As the last 24 hours have demonstrated, markets remain very sensitive to downside news," wrote strategist Henry Allen in a Monday note. "Nevertheless, periodic selloffs are a normal feature of markets, and as we look forward, several factors that could have caused issues in the recent past are now looking more positive." Still, Allen pointed to four factors that could potentially drag the bull rally down, as follows: — Lisa Kailai Han Canaccord Genuity expects a stock market pullback this quarter to set the stage for another positive year for stocks. "Last week's new closing high in the SPX for the first time in seven weeks, coupled with the slight outperformance of the SPW so far in 2025, is further evidence that the bull market that began in October 2022 remains intact," wrote analyst Michael Welch. "We continue to expect some near-term downside for the SPX and believe a Q1 low will set the stage for another positive year." The analyst added that the median quarter-one drawdown was 4.4% following a year of the S&P 500 gaining over 20%, such as 2024. However, the median calendar year gain following an outperforming year was 12.09%. — Lisa Kailai Han Single-stock ETFs that bet on Nvidia to go up every single day have become very popular, but now they are headed for their worst day on record. The GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL), T-Rex 2X Long Nvidia Daily Target ETF (NVDX) and the Direxion Daily NVDA Bull 2x Shares ETF (NVDU) were all down about 32% in midday trading. Those funds entered the day with about $1.7 billion in combined assets under management, according to FactSet. This is what the funds are designed to do. They are built using to derivatives to deliver two-times the performance of Nvidia on a one-day basis, delivering amplified returns in either direction. On the flipside, funds that bet against Nvidia are having a banner day. The GraniteShares 2x Short NVDA Daily ETF (NVD) is up more than 30%. The short Nvidia funds all entered the day with less than $100 million in assets apiece, however. — Jesse Pound Nvidia's slide on Monday pulled shares below their respective 200-day moving average for the first time in two years. Shares are down nearly 16% on the heels of a broader sell-off in the technology sector, as China's DeepSeek seized investor attention and sparked concern that the AI trade could be losing steam. — Brian Evans, Adrian van Hauwermeiren The artificial intelligence trade has powered the bull market rally for the last two years. Investors have debated whether or not valuations have exceeded their fair prices, but UBS believes that the tech really still has more room to run. "Tech sector volatility could pick up in 2025. But we also expect robust capital spending and further progress on AI monetization, with strong earnings supporting our preferred stocks," wrote strategist Sundeep Gantori in a Monday note. "We view the U.S. IT sector as Attractive due to its promising fundamentals, and recommend investors to use any near-term volatility to build up sufficient exposure to quality AI stocks." — Lisa Kailai Han Bank of America says it's "losing hopes" on monetary policy convergence around the world. While the Federal Reserve can afford to wait before further lowering rates, uncertainty in other G10 economies means that will likely have to keep cutting. The European Central Bank is expected to cut to 1.5%, per economist Claudio Irigoyen, which will widen the rate differential with the Fed. Emerging markets, which broadly have "less anchored inflation expectations," could also see some difficult trade offs, Irigoyen added. — Hakyung Kim The Dow Jones Industrial Average would actually be higher on Monday if it weren't for losses in Nvidia, which is single-handledly taking the market lower on concern that China is suddenly racing ahead in the contest to master artificial intelligence. Nvidia at its low fell $21.81 to $120.80, equal to more than 134 points off the Dow, which Nvidia only joined in early November. Every $1 move up or down in any stock in the Dow, which is calculated based on companies' individual share prices rather than their total market value, raises or lowers the average by 6.15 points. — Scott Schnipper Apple became the most valuable publicly traded company once again on Monday, after Nvidia's rout sent its market value plummeting. Microsoft also surpassed the chipmaker, landing in the number two spot. Shares of Nvidia tumbled 13.5% on concerns over possible competition from Chinese startup DeepSeek, which claims it launched a free, open-source language model at a fraction of the cost of its competitors. Apple's market cap currently sits near $3.4 billion, while Microsoft is at $3.2 billion. Nvidia's market cap is just shy of $3.1 billion. Just last week, Nvidia had reclaimed the top spot, replacing Apple as the most valuable company. — Michelle Fox, Nick Wells Nvidia is on track to notch its largest daily decline in nearly half of a decade as Chinese startup DeepSeek's large language model catalyzed a global tech sell-off. Shares of the artificial intelligence darling slid more than 13% in morning trading. If that holds, Monday would mark Nvidia's worst day since March 2020, when the stock tumbled 18.5% in a session. With Monday's decline, Nvidia is now down more than 5% in 2025. The DeepSeek developments also weighed on other AI plays, as well as stocks tied to the buildout of power providers to support this technology. Tech stocks in international markets also felt the heat on Monday. — Alex Harring The CBOE Market Volatility Index, known on Wall Street as the VIX, soared more than 45% early Monday to 21.56 — up from just 14.85 on Friday, according to FactSet data. The VIX briefly rose as high as 22.51 on Monday. The VIX is a measure of how much investors expect the S&P 500 will move over the next 30 days and is often considered a byword for how much fear there is in the stock market and where current sentiment stands. The 52-week high of 38.57 in the VIX came during August's risk-off unwinding of Japanese yen carry trades when the Bank of Japan raised rates, the dollar weakened and it briefly looked as though U.S. unemployment was picking up. — Scott Schnipper Stocks were lower across the board to kick off the new trading week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 200 points, or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 shed 1.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 3.4%. — Lisa Kailai Han These are the stocks moving the most in premarket trading: Nvidia — The artificial intelligence darling saw shares tumbling more than 11% in premarket trading, on track for its worst day since March 2020. The sell-off occurred after Chinese startup DeepSeek launched a free open-source large-language model, saying it was developed in just two months at a cost of under $6 million. Microsoft, Amazon — Other megacap stocks also sold off sharply after the news of DeepSeek stoked questions about the large amounts of money Big Tech companies have been investing in AI models and data centers. Shares of Microsoft shed 5%, while Amazon dropped by more than 4% and Meta Platforms slid by 2.5%. Constellation Energy, Vistra — Power providers for AI infrastructure were also hit hard on concerns that there would be less energy needed if DeepSeek can perform using fewer chips. Constellation Energy, Vistra, Nuscale Power and Oklo all slid at least 10% in premarket trading. Read the full list of stocks moving here. — Yun Li, Lisa Kailai Han More than 80% of stocks in the Nasdaq 100 retreated in Monday's premarket, underscoring the technology rout tied to Chinese startup DeepSeek and artificial intelligence. With all those members sliding, the tech-focused index fell more than 4%. Marvell Technology led the way down with a drop of more than 12%, while Broadcom, Constellation Energy and Nvidia each tumbled more than 11%. AI-related names sold off before the bell as concerns mounted around the potential for a stock bubble. This was catalyzed by the strong performance from DeepSeek's open-source AI model, which has raised questions about the amount of investment needed in the technology. — Alex Harring The tech-heavy Nasdaq is set to open sharply lower on Monday, but a fund tracking Chinese tech names is looking at a rally. The KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB) rose about 1% in premarket trading, building on a 3.7% gain from Friday. The top holdings in the fund include Tencent, Alibaba and Trip.com. There doesn't appear to be any direct link between major Chinese tech stocks and the new DeepSeek AI model. The move could be partly a catch-up trade, as KWEB has been a long-term underperformer of U.S. tech funds. — Jesse Pound Travel + Leisure Co. will be a winner as travel demand accelerates, according to Bank of America. The firm double-upgraded its rating on shares of the membership and leisure travel company to buy from underperform. It also hiked its price target to $60 per share from $40. A more resilient leisure travel backdrop in 2025, as well as a lower rate environment, will benefit Travel + Leisure, according to analyst Dany Asad. "We now think TNL is best positioned to deliver peer-leading double-digit EPS growth in 2025. TNL's inventory spend is limited, putting free cash flow conversion ahead of peers and enabling aggressive stock buy backs," Asad wrote in a Monday note. — Hakyung Kim Nvidia shares dropped 11% to lead a major tech sell-off after Chinese startup DeepSeek raised concerns over the U.S.' competitiveness in AI. Fellow chipmakers Micron and AMD lost 8.6% and 5.5%, respectively. Megacap tech names Amazon and Meta fell about 5% each, while Microsoft pulled back by 6%. — Fred Imbert, Jenni Reid Europe's regional Stoxx 600 index was 0.69% lower at 8:30 a.m. London time, with Germany's DAX index falling 1.2%. Technology was the worst-performing sector, down 4%, as artificial intelligence firms retreated around the world on concerns over competition from China's DeepSeek. Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory deVere Group, said DeepSeek's newly launched AI model had been reported to be more cost-effective while running on less advanced chips than tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. "Deepseek is going to challenge Silicon Valley's leadership, disrupting the global tech landscape and reshaping the direction of the AI arms race," Green said in emailed comments. "The launch of this innovation underscores a historic pivot in the balance of technological power." — Jenni Reid Roughly 90 S&P 500 companies are due to post their latest quarterly figures. Here's your earnings calendar for the week: Read here for CNBC Pro's breakdown of some key reports. — Pia Singh Stock futures opened lower ahead of a busy earnings week and key inflation data. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 124 points, or 0.3%. S&P futures shed 0.5%, while Nasdaq 100 futures slid 194 points, or nearly 0.9%. — Pia Singh Got a confidential news tip?

Title: LIMETA 10000mAh Dual 18W (36W) USB-C Power bank $13.93 + delivery ($0 Prime/$59+) @ Li-meta via Amazon

can also claim free 100W 2m USB-C cable by adding both items from the How to claim Free benefit gift area in green under the price. Warning: I clicked through once and the green text link disappeared when I refreshed/went back to the item page. so be careful seems to be limited to click once per account. even after clearing cookies and refreshing Free gift page link is gone for me. all time low for this small capacity power bank. cheaper than the recent $19 Anko 10000mAh (which tbf had built in cables but only did 15W). and $1.20 more than the cheapest $12.74 INIU 10000mAh (but tbf the LIMETA goes 18W single port and 36W dual port compared to INIU’s 15W). this cheaper LIMETA page looks identical to the other listing, but this one has been on sale from November 2022 making it 2 year 2 month old stock compared to 1 year 3 month old stock of the $20 one which has been posted before (you can claim free cable on this one too). fyi guys because this is older stock of the same model: I might have missed it but could not find any marketing mentioning the 80% charge limit by app function that’s on the $20 one. (possible only when charging power bank at 18W with one port). the exact same looking $20 LIMETA is also known to use high quality Samsung batteries inside, I don’t know if it is true of this older stock $13 one. (regular power banks won’t use Samsung batteries anyway, but some people like hearing that) also do not plug two chargers into any power bank. this is a feature unique to this LIMETA power bank. This one has the ability to limit charging to 80%, I am currently using the ISD Link app. Can't seem to find an official Limeta app on android. ISDT and Limeta are the same company or closely related. I used apkpure to download the Android version of the app. thanks. 👍 sounds like you have the $13 one and you tested so 80% charge limit works on it. Nice - that is cheap - I paid the full original price (nearly $30) over a year ago - it's been a great powerbank Yep got the cable for free nice. yeah weird for me even logged out I can’t see the Benefit link under the price anymore. I had the Benefit page in my browser history before so I could have technically still got it. but worth knowing you can lose the link easily. Ok found it. $13 model is PB40 $20 is EB40 Not sure whats the differences are but $13 model also shows EB40 in many areas. $20 page says Model No. EB40, Part No. PB40. so my conclusion was same model, just old stock or V1 version? a lot of the function also the exact same. https://www.isdt.co/pb40.html?lang=en I think juat different brand. Not sure.. but im not savvy enough to break open the $13 later lol Sold out Oh c…crap! That was quick Tried adding it to my cart and it was no longer available. Uses samsung 21700 cells, does pass through charging, has 2 independent 18w circuits. I have it hooked up to my laptop and app shows one circuit is charging the power bank at 18w and the other is charging the laptop at 22w (even when it claims 18w is max). Do not try to charge the powerbank using 2 cables from the same power brick for e.g 2x cables from a single 65W PD brick, the power bank did make some weird noises, use 2 separate power bricks and it will be fine. Does get a little hot but there is an option within the app to reduce the heat through decreasing charge/discharge strength. Got the Apple Watch charger version. It’s also on sale but with lower capacity. Also has the bonus cable. 7000mAh one right? haven't seen that one before. but I also don't have a AW. I wonder if it can charge both phone and watch at the same time if you put the phone face down->powerbank->AW on top. Here to look for fire comments… I prefer models that come with included cables, and they are slimmer. I bought one on sale for $10 a year ago. I prefer models that come with included cables you mean built in cables? yeah they can be handy especially if travelling you don't have to constantly wonder where the cable is. Yes! $20 one still in stock guys. link at bottom of deal post.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg's $65 Billion AI Bet Benefits Nvidia And Other Players, Says Top Analyst, But Warns Market Bull Run Will 'End In A Spectacular Bubble Burst'
URL: https://www.benzinga.com/startups/25/01/43217408/mark-zuckerbergs-65-billion-ai-bet-benefits-nvidia-and-other-players-says-top-analyst-but-warns-mark
Time Published: 2025-01-26T03:12:14Z
Full Content:
Deepwater Asset Management’s Gene Munster says Meta Platform Inc.’s META plans to invest up to $65 billion this year to expand its AI infrastructure will benefit Nvidia Corp. NVDA and other hardware players. What Happened: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Friday outlined the company’s capital spending plans for 2025 and its focus on artificial intelligence (AI). Don’t Miss: Zuckerberg expects Meta to allocate between $60 billion and $65 billion for capital spending, primarily aimed at expanding the company's AI teams and building a new data center. he described the new data center as being “so large that it would cover a significant part of Manhattan.” The tech mogul further noted that Meta aims to bring a gigawatt of computing power online by 2025 and is projected to finish the year with over 1.3 million graphics processing units. Weighing in on the announcement, Munster said Meta’s commitment “exceeds Street estimates of $51B.” "In 2025, I expect Meta AI will be the leading assistant serving more than 1 billion people, Llama 4 will become the leading state of the art model, and we'll build an AI engineer that will start contributing increasing amounts of code to our R&D efforts," Zuckerberg said. See Also: Nancy Pelosi Invested $5 Million In An AI Company Last Year — Here's How You Can Invest In Multiple Pre-IPO AI Startups With Just $1,000 According to Munster, the increased investment in AI infrastructure will particularly benefit Nvidia and other hardware players in the short term. In the long term, the higher capital expenditure (Capex) is expected to accelerate the AI flywheel, leading to more innovation, lower usage costs, an increase in customers, and consequently, more investment. He also issued a reminder, stating, “I believe the market is going higher and the run will end in a spectacular bubble burst.” The latest datapoint that the AI trade remains intact. Zuckerberg's comment that $META will spend $60–$65B in Capex for 2025 exceeds Street estimates of $51B.In the near term, increased investment in AI infrastructure benefits $NVDA and other hardware players.Long term,… Why It Matters: Zuckerberg’s announcement comes on the heels of Meta’s recent AI advancements. In December, Meta introduced the Llama 3.3 70B, a new AI model that outperforms competitors like Alphabet Inc.‘s GOOGL GOOG Google, OpenAI, and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN. This model offers the performance of Meta's largest Llama model, Llama 3.1 405B, but at a reduced cost. Last year in April, Meta announced its plan to purchase 350,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs by 2024 to fuel its AI initiatives. Zuckerberg then said the 350,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs were initially intended to enhance Instagram Reels, not to position Meta as a leader in AI technology. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump criticized the European Union (EU) for focusing on U.S. tech giants like Meta, Apple, and Google. He accused EU regulators of unfairly targeting these companies, calling their actions “a form of taxation.” Price Action: Meta Platform’s stock closed at $647.49 on Friday, down 0.20% for the day, according to Benzinga Pro data.

If They Could Show A Plan For Ending World Hunger He'd Donate $6 Billion – ‘I Will Sell Tesla Stock Right Now And Do It' Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target – Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share! Zuckerberg expects Meta to allocate between $60 billion and $65 billion for capital spending, primarily aimed at expanding the company's AI teams and building a new data center. he described the new data center as being “so large that it would cover a significant part of Manhattan.” The tech mogul further noted that Meta aims to bring a gigawatt of computing power online by 2025 and is projected to finish the year with over 1.3 million graphics processing units. Weighing in on the announcement, Munster said Meta’s commitment “exceeds Street estimates of $51B.” "In 2025, I expect Meta AI will be the leading assistant serving more than 1 billion people, Llama 4 will become the leading state of the art model, and we'll build an AI engineer that will start contributing increasing amounts of code to our R&D efforts," Zuckerberg said.

He also issued a reminder, stating, “I believe the market is going higher and the run will end in a spectacular bubble burst.” Why It Matters: Zuckerberg’s announcement comes on the heels of Meta’s recent AI advancements. In December, Meta introduced the Llama 3.3 70B, a new AI model that outperforms competitors like Alphabet Inc.‘s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google, OpenAI, and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). This model offers the performance of Meta's largest Llama model, Llama 3.1 405B, but at a reduced cost. Last year in April, Meta announced its plan to purchase 350,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs by 2024 to fuel its AI initiatives. Zuckerberg then said the 350,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs were initially intended to enhance Instagram Reels, not to position Meta as a leader in AI technology. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump criticized the European Union (EU) for focusing on U.S. tech giants like Meta, Apple, and Google. He accused EU regulators of unfairly targeting these companies, calling their actions “a form of taxation.” Price Action: Meta Platform’s stock closed at $647.49 on Friday, down 0.20% for the day, according to Benzinga Pro data.

Restaurant stocks. While hot tech and social media stocks like Amazon and Meta Platforms continue to make new highs, there is one sector failing to keep up: restaurant stocks. Some of these names — like McDonalds — used to be considered must-owns for portfolio managers looking to outperform the averages. Judging by these price charts, those days may be over. Arcos Dorados Holdings (Nasdaq: ARCO): Arcos Dorados Holdings daily price chart, 1 25 25. The price in mid-December dropped below the mid-September support where the red-dotted line is placed. The 50-day moving average in May crossed below the 200-day moving average. The stock briefly rallied off of the late year low but remains below both of those moving averages. Arcos Dorados trades with a price-earnings ratio of 10.57 and at 3 times its book value. The debt-to-equity ratio is 3.35. This year’s earnings are off by 26%. Over the past five years, EPS shows growth of 37%. The company pays a 3.41% dividend. McDonalds (NYSE: MCD): McDonalds daily price chart, 1 25 25. The price in mid-January dipped below the 200-day moving average and has since rallied a bit, although it remains below a down-trending 50-day moving average. That dip down broke below the November low, a previous level of buying support, indicated by the red-dotted line. The company, one of the most recognized brand names in the world, has a market cap of $204 billion. It trades with a price-earnings ratio of 25. Earnings this year are off by 1.36% and up over the past five years by 8.93%. McDonald’s pays a dividend of 2.37%. Restaurant Brands International (NYSE: QSR): Restaurant Brands International daily price chart, 1 25 25. The price in early January broke below the previous support level from late May of $54. The stock has rallied off of the mid-month low of $50 and the buying volume looks strong. The 50-day moving average in early June crossed below the 200-day moving average and it’s never gone back above it. Restaurant Brands includes the franchises Burger King, Tim Hortons, Popeyes and Firehouse Subs. Market cap is $20.10 billion. The price-earnings ratio is 15. The debt-to-equity ratio is on the high side at 4.94. The company offers investors a 3.75% dividend. Wendy’s (Nasdaq: WEN): Wendy's daily price chart, 1 25 25. Last week’s new low takes the price well below the July low, the previous level of buying support. The stock participated in the post-election rally and then began a steady descent in value. The 50-day moving average in mid-January crossed below the 200-day moving average, a clear signal of weakness. Market capitalization is $2.91 billion. The price-earnings ratio is 15. The debt-to-equity ratio is a steep 15. This year’s earnings are up by 2.85%. EPS growth over the past five years is 10%. The short float of 6.56% indicates a greater interest among short sellers than the other similar brands listed here. Yum Brands (NYSE: YUM): Yum Brands daily price chart, 1 25 25. The mid-January low briefly took the price below the late July low. The stock found buyers at $122 and rallied back to just above $129. The 50-day moving average last week crossed below the 200-day moving average. Yum Brands operates more than 59,000 restaurants in over 150 countries and territories, according to the company website. Market cap is $35.79 billion. The price-earnings ratio is 23.99. Earnings this year are up by 5.87% and up over the past five years by 3.62%. Yum pays a 2.08% dividend. Stats courtesy of FinViz.com.

Title: The impact of competition and DeepSeek on Nvidia

Time Published: 2025-01-25T15:30:25Z
Full Content:
Jeffrey Emanuel January 25, 2025 60 min read As someone who spent ~10 years working as a generalist investment analyst at various long/short hedge funds (including stints at Millennium and Balyasny), while also being something of a math and computer nerd who has been studying deep learning since 2010 (back when Geoff Hinton was still talking about Restricted Boltzmann Machines and everything was still programmed using MATLAB, and researchers were still trying to show that they could get better results at classifying handwritten digits than by using Support Vector Machines), I'd like to think that I have a fairly unusual perspective on how AI technology is developing and how this relates to equity valuations in the stock market. For the past few years, I have been working more as a developer, and have several popular open-source projects for working with various forms of AI models/services (e.g., see LLM Aided OCR, Swiss Army Llama, Fast Vector Similarity, Source to Prompt, and Pastel Inference Layer for a few recent examples). Basically, I am using these frontier models all day, every day, in about as intense a way as possible. I have 3 Claude accounts so I don't run out of requests, and signed up for ChatGPT Pro within minutes of it being available. I also try to keep on top of the latest research advances, and carefully read all the major technical report papers that come out from the major AI labs. So I think I have a pretty good read on the space and how things are developing. At the same time, I've shorted a ton of stocks in my life and have won the best idea prize on the Value Investors Club twice (for TMS long and PDH short if you're keeping track at home). I say this not to brag, but rather to help establish my bona fides as someone who could opine on the subject without coming across as hopelessly naive to either technologists or professional investors. And while there are surely many people who know the math/science better, and people who are better at long/short investing in the stock market than me, I doubt there are very many who are in the middle of the Venn diagram to the extent I can claim to be. With all that said, whenever I meet with and chat with my friends and ex colleagues from the hedge fund world, the conversation quickly turns to Nvidia. It's not every day that a company goes from relative obscurity to being worth more than the combined stock markets of England, France, or Germany! And naturally, these friends want to know my thoughts on the subject. Because I am such a dyed-in-the-wool believer in the long term transformative impact of this technology— I truly believe it's going to radically change nearly every aspect of our economy and society in the next 5-10 years, with basically no historical precedent— it has been hard for me to make the argument that Nvidia's momentum is going to slow down or stop anytime soon. But even though I've thought the valuation was just too rich for my blood for the past year or so, a confluence of recent developments has caused me to flip a bit to my usual instinct, which is to be a bit more contrarian in outlook and to question the consensus when it seems to be more than priced in. The saying "what the wise man believes in the beginning, the fool believes in the end" became famous for a good reason. Before we get into the developments that give me pause, let's pause to briefly review the bull case for NVDA shares, which is basically now known by everyone and his brother. Deep learning and AI are the most transformative technologies since the internet, and poised to change basically everything in our society. Nvidia has somehow ended up with something close to a monopoly in terms of the share of aggregate industry capex that is spent on training and inference infrastructure. Some of the largest and most profitable companies in the world, like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Google, Oracle, etc., have all decided that they must do and spend whatever it takes to stay competitive in this space because they simply cannot afford to be left behind. The amount of capex dollars, gigawatts of electricity used, square footage of new-build data centers, and, of course, the number of GPUs, has absolutely exploded and seems to show no sign of slowing down. And Nvidia is able to earn insanely high 90%+ gross margins on the most high-end, datacenter oriented products. We've just scratched the surface here of the bull case. There are many additional aspects to it now, which have made even people who were already very bullish to become incrementally more bullish. Besides things like the rise of humanoid robots, which I suspect is going to take most people by surprise when they are rapidly able to perform a huge number of tasks that currently require an unskilled (or even skilled) human worker (e.g., doing laundry, cleaning, organizing, and cooking; doing construction work like renovating a bathroom or building a house in a team of workers; running a warehouse and driving forklifts, etc.), there are other factors which most people haven't even considered. One major thing that you hear the smart crowd talking about is the rise of "a new scaling law," which has created a new paradigm thinking about how compute needs will increase over time. The original scaling law, which is what has been driving progress in AI since AlexNet appeared in 2012 and the Transformer architecture was invented in 2017, is the pre-training scaling law: that the more billions (and now trillions) worth of tokens we can use as training data, and the larger the parameter count of the models we are training, and the more FLOPS of compute that we expend on training those models on those tokens, the better the performance of the resulting models on a large variety of highly useful downstream tasks. Not only that, but this improvement is somewhat knowable, to the point where the leading AI labs like OpenAI and Anthropic have a pretty good idea of just how good their latest models would be even before they started the actual training runs— in some cases, predicting the benchmarks of the final models to within a couple percentage points. This "original scaling law" has been vitally important, but always caused some doubts in the minds of people projecting the future with it. For one thing, we seem to have already exhausted the world's accumulated set of high quality training data. Of course, that's not literally true— there are still so many old books and periodicals that haven't yet been properly digitized, and even if they have, are not properly licensed for use as training data. The problem is that, even if you give credit for all that stuff— say the sum total of "professionally" produced English language written content from the year 1500 to, say, the year 2000, it's not such a tremendous amount in percentage terms when you're talking about a training corpus of nearly 15 trillion tokens, which is the scale of current frontier models. For a quick reality check of those numbers: Google Books has digitized around 40mm books so far; if a typical book has 50k to 100k words, or 65k to 130k tokens, then that's between 2.6T and 5.2T tokens just from books, though surely a large chunk of that is already included in the training corpora used by the big labs, whether it's strictly legal or not. And there are lots of academic papers, with the arXiv website alone having over 2mm papers. And the Library of Congress has over 3 billion digitized newspaper pages. Taken together, that could be as much as 7T tokens in total, but since much of this is in fact included in training corpora, the remaining "incremental" training data probably isn't all that significant in the grand scheme of things. Of course, there are other ways to gather more training data. You could automatically transcribe every single YouTube video for example, and use that text. And while that might be helpful on the margin, it's certainly of much lower quality than, say, a highly respected textbook on Organic Chemistry as a source of useful knowledge about the world. So we've always had a looming "data wall" when it comes to the original scaling law; although we know we can keep shoveling more and more capex into GPUs and building more and more data centers, it's a lot harder to mass produce useful new human knowledge which is correct and incremental to what is already out there. Now, one intriguing response to this has been the rise of "synthetic data," which is text that is itself the output of an LLM. And while this seems almost nonsensical that it would work to "get high on your own supply" as a way of improving model quality, it actually seems to work very well in practice, at least in the domain of math, logic, and computer programming. The reason, of course, is that these are areas where we can mechanically check and prove the correctness of things. So we can sample from the vast universe of possible math theorems or possible Python scripts, and then actually check if they are correct, and only include them in our corpus if they are. And in this way, we can very dramatically expand our collection of high quality training data, at least in these kinds of areas. And then there are all the other kinds of data we could be training AI on besides text. For example, what if we take the entire whole genome sequencing (around 200 GB to 300 GB uncompressed for a single human being) for 100 million people? That's a lot of data obviously, although the vast majority of it would be nearly identical between any two people. Of course, this could be misleading to compare to textual data from books and the internet for various reasons: But it's still another large source of diverse information that we could train huge models on in the future, which is why I included it. So while there is some hope in terms of being able to capture more and more additional training data, if you look at the rate at which training corpora have grown in recent years, it quickly becomes obvious that we are close to hitting a wall in terms of data availability for "generally useful" knowledge that can get us closer to the ultimate goal of getting artificial super-intelligence which is 10x smarter than John von Neumann and is an absolute world-class expert on every specialty known to man. Besides the limited amount of available data, there have always been a couple other things that have lurked in the back of the mind of proponents of the pre-training scaling law. A big one of these is, after you've finished training the model, what are you supposed to do with all that compute infrastructure? Train the next model? Sure, you can do that, but given the rapid improvement in GPU speed and capacity, and the importance of electricity and other opex in the economic calculations, does it even really make sense to use your 2 year old cluster to train your new model? Surely you'd rather use the brand new data center you just built that costs 10x the old data center and is 20x more powerful because of better technology. The problem is, at some point you do need to amortize the up-front cost of these investments and recoup it with a stream of (hopefully positive) operating profit, right? The market is so excited about AI that it has thankfully ignored this, allowing companies like OpenAI to post breathtaking from-inception, cumulative operating losses while garnering increasingly eye-popping valuations in follow-up investment rounds (although, to their credit, they have also been able to demonstrate very fast growing revenues). But eventually, for this situation to be sustainable over a full market cycle, these data center costs do need to eventually be recouped, hopefully with a profit, which over time is competitive with other investment opportunities on a risk-adjusted basis. OK, so that was the pre-training scaling law. What's this "new" scaling law? Well, that's something that people really just started focusing on in the past year: inference time compute scaling. Before, the vast majority of all the compute you'd expend in the process was the up-front training compute to create the model in the first place. Once you had the trained model, performing inference on that model— i.e., asking a question or having the LLM perform some kind of task for you— used a certain, limited amount of compute. Critically, the total amount of inference compute (measured in various ways, such as FLOPS, in GPU memory footprint, etc.) was much, much less than what was required for the pre-training phase. Of course, the amount of inference compute does flex up when you increase the context window size of the models and the amount of output that you generate from them in one go (although researchers have made breathtaking algorithmic improvements on this front relative to the initial quadratic scaling people originally expected in scaling this up). But essentially, until recently, inference compute was generally a lot less intensive than training compute, and scaled basically linearly with the number of requests you are handling— the more demand for text completions from ChatGPT, for instance, the more inference compute you used up. With the advent of the revolutionary Chain-of-Thought ("COT") models introduced in the past year, most noticeably in OpenAI's flagship O1 model (but very recently in DeepSeek's new R1 model, which we will talk about later in much more detail), all that changed. Instead of the amount of inference compute being directly proportional to the length of the output text generated by the model (scaling up for larger context windows, model size, etc.), these new COT models also generate intermediate "logic tokens"; think of this as a sort of scratchpad or "internal monologue" of the model while it's trying to solve your problem or complete its assigned task. This represents a true sea change in how inference compute works: now, the more tokens you use for this internal chain of thought process, the better the quality of the final output you can provide the user. In effect, it's like giving a human worker more time and resources to accomplish a task, so they can double and triple check their work, do the same basic task in multiple different ways and verify that they come out the same way; take the result they came up with and "plug it in" to the formula to check that it actually does solve the equation, etc. It turns out that this approach works almost amazingly well; it is essentially leveraging the long anticipated power of what is called "reinforcement learning" with the power of the Transformer architecture. It directly addresses the single biggest weakness of the otherwise phenomenally successful Transformer model, which is its propensity to "hallucinate". Basically, the way Transformers work in terms of predicting the next token at each step is that, if they start out on a bad "path" in their initial response, they become almost like a prevaricating child who tries to spin a yarn about why they are actually correct, even if they should have realized mid-stream using common sense that what they are saying couldn't possibly be correct. Because the models are always seeking to be internally consistent and to have each successive generated token flow naturally from the preceding tokens and context, it's very hard for them to course-correct and backtrack. By breaking the inference process into what is effectively many intermediate stages, they can try lots of different things and see what's working and keep trying to course-correct and try other approaches until they can reach a fairly high threshold of confidence that they aren't talking nonsense. Perhaps the most extraordinary thing about this approach, beyond the fact that it works at all, is that the more logic/COT tokens you use, the better it works. Suddenly, you now have an additional dial you can turn so that, as you increase the amount of COT reasoning tokens (which uses a lot more inference compute, both in terms of FLOPS and memory), the higher the probability is that you will give a correct response— code that runs the first time without errors, or a solution to a logic problem without an obviously wrong deductive step. I can tell you from a lot of firsthand experience that, as good as Anthropic's Claude3.5 Sonnet model is at Python programming— and it is indeed VERY good— whenever you need to generate anything long and complicated, it invariably ends up making one or more stupid mistakes. Now, these mistakes are usually pretty easy to fix, and in fact you can normally fix them by simply feeding the errors generated by the Python interpreter, without any further explanation, as a follow-up inference prompt (or, more usefully, paste in the complete set of detected "problems" found in the code by your code editor, using what something called a Linter), it was still an annoying additional step. And when the code becomes very long or very complicated, it can sometimes take a lot longer to fix, and might even require some manual debugging by hand. The first time I tried the O1 model from OpenAI was like a revelation: I was amazed how often the code would be perfect the very first time. And that's because the COT process automatically finds and fixes problems before they ever make it to a final response token in the answer the model gives you. In fact, the O1 model used in OpenAI's ChatGPT Plus subscription for $20/month is basically the same model as the one used in the O1-Pro model featured in their new ChatGPT Pro subscription for 10x the price ($200/month, which raised plenty of eyebrows in the developer community); the main difference is that O1-Pro thinks for a lot longer before responding, generating vastly more COT logic tokens, and consuming a far larger amount of inference compute for every response. This is quite striking in that, even a very long and complex prompt for Claude3.5 Sonnet or GPT4o, with ~400kb+ of context given, generally takes less than 10 seconds to begin responding, and often less than 5 seconds. Whereas that same prompt to O1-Pro could easily take 5+ MINUTES before you get a response (although OpenAI does show you some of the "reasoning steps" that are generated during the process while you wait; critically, OpenAI has decided, presumably for trade secret related reasons,to hide from you the exact reasoning tokens it generates, showing you instead a highly abbreviated summary of these). As you can probably imagine, there are tons of contexts where accuracy is paramount— where you'd rather give up and tell the user you can't do it at all rather than give an answer that could be trivially proven wrong or which involves hallucinated facts or otherwise specious reasoning. Anything involving money/transactions, medical stuff, legal stuff, just to name a few. Basically, wherever the cost of inference is trivial relative to the hourly all-in compensation of the human knowledge worker who is interacting with the AI system, that's a case where it become a complete no-brainer to dial up the COT compute (the major drawback is that it increases the latency of responses by a lot, so there are still some contexts where you might prefer to iterate faster by getting lower latency responses that are less accurate or correct). Some of the most exciting news in the AI world came out just a few weeks ago and concerned OpenAI's new unreleased O3 model, which was able to solve a large variety of tasks that were previously deemed to be out of reach of current AI approaches in the near term. And the way it was able to do these hardest problems (which include exceptionally tough "foundational" math problems that would be very hard for even highly skilled professional mathematicians to solve), is that OpenAI threw insane amount of compute resources at the problems— in some cases, spending $3k+ worth of compute power to solve a single task (compare this to traditional inference costs for a single task, which would be unlikely to exceed a couple dollars using regular Transformer models without chain-of-thought). It doesn't take an AI genius to realize that this development creates a new scaling law that is totally independent of the original pre-training scaling law. Now, you still want to train the best model you can by cleverly leveraging as much compute as you can and as many trillion tokens of high quality training data as possible, but that's just the beginning of the story in this new world; now, you could easily use incredibly huge amounts of compute just to do inference from these models at a very high level of confidence or when trying to solve extremely tough problems that require "genius level" reasoning to avoid all the potential pitfalls that would lead a regular LLM astray. Even if you believe, as I do, that the future prospects for AI are almost unimaginably bright, the question still remains, "Why should one company extract the majority of the profit pool from this technology?" There are certainly many historical cases where a very important new technology changed the world, but the main winners were not the companies that seemed the most promising during the initial stages of the process. The Wright Brothers' airplane company in all its current incarnations across many different firms today isn't worth more than $10b despite them inventing and perfecting the technology well ahead of everyone else. And while Ford has a respectable market cap of $40b today, it's just 1.1% of Nvidia's current market cap. To understand this, it's important to really understand why Nvidia is currently capturing so much of the pie today. After all, they aren't the only company that even makes GPUs. AMD makes respectable GPUs that, on paper, have comparable numbers of transistors, which are made using similar process nodes, etc. Sure, they aren't as fast or as advanced as Nvidia's GPUs, but it's not like the Nvidia GPUs are 10x faster or anything like that. In fact, in terms of naive/raw dollars per FLOP, AMD GPUs are something like half the price of Nvidia GPUs. Looking at other semiconductor markets such as the DRAM market, despite the fact that it is also very highly consolidated with only 3 meaningful global players (Samsung, Micron, SK-Hynix), gross margins in the DRAM market range from negative at the bottom of the cycle to ~60% at the very top of the cycle, with an average in the 20% range. Compare that to Nvidia's overall gross margin in recent quarters of ~75%, which is dragged down by the lower-margin and more commoditized consumer 3D graphics category. So how is this possible? Well, the main reasons have to do with software— better drivers that "just work" on Linux and which are highly battle-tested and reliable (unlike AMD, which is notorious for the low quality and instability of their Linux drivers), and highly optimized open-source code in popular libraries such as PyTorch that has been tuned to work really well on Nvidia GPUs. It goes beyond that though— the very programming framework that coders use to write low-level code that is optimized for GPUs, CUDA, is totally proprietary to Nvidia, and it has become a de facto standard. If you want to hire a bunch of extremely talented programmers who know how to make things go really fast on GPUs, and pay them $650k/year or whatever the going rate is for people with that particular expertise, chances are that they are going to "think" and work in CUDA. Besides software superiority, the other major thing that Nvidia has going for it is what is known as interconnect— essentially, the bandwidth that connects together thousands of GPUs together efficiently so they can be jointly harnessed to train today's leading-edge foundational models. In short, the key to efficient training is to keep all the GPUs as fully utilized as possible all the time— not waiting around idling until they receive the next chunk of data they need to compute the next step of the training process. The bandwidth requirements are extremely high— much, much higher than the typical bandwidth that is needed in traditional data center use cases. You can't really use traditional networking gear or fiber optics for this kind of interconnect, since it would introduce too much latency and wouldn't give you the pure terabytes per second of bandwidth that is needed to keep all the GPUs constantly busy. Nvidia made an incredibly smart decision to purchase the Israeli company Mellanox back in 2019 for a mere $6.9b, and this acquisition is what provided them with their industry leading interconnect technology. Note that interconnect speed is a lot more relevant to the training process, where you have to harness together the output of thousands of GPUs at the same time, than the inference process (including COT inference), which can use just a handful of GPUs— all you need is enough VRAM to store the quantized (compressed) model weights of the already-trained model. So those are arguably the major components of Nvidia's "moat" and how it has been able to maintain such high margins for so long (there is also a "flywheel" aspect to things, where they aggressively invest their super-normal profits into tons of R&D, which in turn helps them improve their tech at a faster rate than the competition, so they are always in the lead in terms of raw performance). But as was pointed out earlier, what customers really tend to care about, all other things being equal, is performance per dollar (both in up-front capex cost of equipment and in energy usage, so performance per watt), and even though Nvidia's GPUs are certainly the fastest, they are not the best price/performance when measured naively in terms of FLOPS. But the thing is, all other things are NOT equal, and the fact that AMD's drivers suck, that popular AI software libraries don't run as well on AMD GPUs, that you can't find really good GPU experts who specialize in AMD GPUs outside of the gaming world (why would they bother when there is more demand in the market for CUDA experts?), that you can't wire thousands of them together as effectively because of lousy interconnect technology for AMD— all this means that AMD is basically not competitive in the high-end data center world, and doesn't seem to have very good prospects for getting there in the near term. Well, that all sounds very bullish for Nvidia, right? Now you can see why the stock is trading at such a huge valuation! But what are the other clouds on the horizon? Well, there are few that I think merit significant attention. Some have been lurking in the background for the last few years, but too small to make a dent considering how quickly the pie has been growing, but where they are getting ready to potentially inflect upwards. Others are very recent developments (as in, the last 2 weeks) that might dramatically change the near-term trajectory of incremental GPU demand. At a very high level, you can think of things like this: Nvidia operated in a pretty niche area for a very long time; they had very limited competition, and the competition wasn't particular profitable or growing fast enough to ever pose a real threat, since they didn't have the capital needed to really apply pressure to a market leader like Nvidia. The gaming market was large and growing, but didn't feature earth shattering margins or particularly fabulous year over year growth rates. A few big tech companies started ramping up hiring and spending on machine learning and AI efforts around 2016-2017, but it was never a truly significant line item for any of them on an aggregate basis— more of a "moonshot" R&D expenditure. But once the big AI race started in earnest with the release of ChatGPT in 2022— only a bit over 2 years ago, although it seems like a lifetime ago in terms of developments— that situation changed very dramatically. Suddenly, big companies were ready to spend many, many billions of dollars incredibly quickly. The number of researchers showing up at the big research conferences like Neurips and ICML went up very, very dramatically. All the smart students who might have previously studied financial derivatives were instead studying Transformers, and $1mm+ compensation packages for non-executive engineering roles (i.e., for independent contributors not managing a team) became the norm at the leading AI labs. It takes a while to change the direction of a massive cruise ship; and even if you move really quickly and spend billions, it takes a year or more to build greenfield data centers and order all the equipment (with ballooning lead times) and get it all set up and working. It takes a long time to hire and onboard even smart coders before they can really hit their stride and familiarize themselves with the existing codebases and infrastructure. But now, you can imagine that absolutely biblical amounts of capital, brainpower, and effort are being expended in this area. And Nvidia has the biggest target of any player on their back, because they are the ones who are making the lion's share of the profits TODAY, not in some hypothetical future where the AI runs our whole lives. So the very high level takeaway is basically that "markets find a way"; they find alternative, radically innovative new approaches to building hardware that leverage completely new ideas to sidestep barriers that help prop up Nvidia's moat. For example, so-called "wafer scale" AI training chips from Cerebras, which dedicate an entire 300mm silicon wafer to an absolutely gargantuan chip that contains orders of magnitude more transistors and cores on a single chip (see this recent blog post from them explaining how they were able to solve the "yield problem" that had been preventing this approach from being economically practical in the past). To put this into perspective, if you compare Cerebras' newest WSE-3 chip to Nvidia's flagship data-center GPU, the H100, the Cerebras chip has a total die area of 46,225 square millimeters compared to just 814 for the H100 (and the H100 is itself considered an enormous chip by industry standards); that's a multiple of ~57x! And instead of having 132 "streaming multiprocessor" cores enabled on the chip like the H100 has, the Cerebras chip has ~900,000 cores (granted, each of these cores is smaller and does a lot less, but it's still an almost unfathomably large number in comparison). In more concrete apples-to-apples terms, the Cerebras chip can do around ~32x the FLOPS in AI contexts as a single H100 chip. Since an H100 sells for close to $40k a pop, you can imagine that the WSE-3 chip isn't cheap. So why does this all matter? Well, instead of trying to battle Nvidia head-on by using a similar approach and trying to match the Mellanox interconnect technology, Cerebras has used a radically innovative approach to do an end-run around the interconnect problem: inter-processor bandwidth becomes much less of an issue when everything is running on the same super-sized chip. You don't even need to have the same level of interconnect because one mega chip replaces tons of H100s. And the Cerebras chips also work extremely well for AI inference tasks. In fact, you can try it today for free here and use Meta's very respectable Llama-3.3-70B model. It responds basically instantaneously, at ~1,500 tokens per second. To put that into perspective, anything above 30 tokens per second feels relatively snappy to users based on comparisons to ChatGPT and Claude, and even 10 tokens per second is fast enough that you can basically read the response while it's being generated. Cerebras is also not alone; there are other companies, like Groq (not to be confused with the Grok model family trained by Elon Musk's X AI). Groq has taken yet another innovative approach to solving the same fundamental problem. Instead of trying to compete with Nvidia's CUDA software stack directly, they've developed what they call a "tensor processing unit" (TPU) that is specifically designed for the exact mathematical operations that deep learning models need to perform. Their chips are designed around a concept called "deterministic compute," which means that, unlike traditional GPUs where the exact timing of operations can vary, their chips execute operations in a completely predictable way every single time. This might sound like a minor technical detail, but it actually makes a massive difference for both chip design and software development. Because the timing is completely deterministic, Groq can optimize their chips in ways that would be impossible with traditional GPU architectures. As a result, they've been demonstrating for the past 6+ months inference speeds of over 500 tokens per second with the Llama series of models and other open source models, far exceeding what's possible with traditional GPU setups. Like Cerebras, this is available today and you can try it for free here. Using a comparable Llama3 model with "speculative decoding," Groq is able to generate 1,320 tokens per second, on par with Cerebras and far in excess of what is possible using regular GPUs. Now, you might ask what the point is of achieving 1,000+ tokens per second when users seem pretty satisfied with ChatGPT, which is operating at less than 10% of that speed. And the thing is, it does matter. It makes it a lot faster to iterate and not lose focus as a human knowledge worker when you get instant feedback. And if you're using the model programmatically via the API, which is increasingly where much of the demand is coming from, then it can enable whole new classes of applications that require multi-stage inference (where the output of previous stages is used as input in successive stages of prompting/inference) or which require low-latency responses, such as content moderation, fraud detection, dynamic pricing, etc. But even more fundamentally, the faster you can serve requests, the faster you can cycle things, and the busier you can keep the hardware. Although Groq's hardware is extremely expensive, clocking in at $2mm to $3mm for a single server, it ends up costing far less per request fulfilled if you have enough demand to keep the hardware busy all the time. And like Nvidia with CUDA, a huge part of Groq's advantage comes from their own proprietary software stack. They are able to take the same open source models that other companies like Meta, DeepSeek, and Mistral develop and release for free, and decompose them in special ways that allow them to run dramatically faster on their specific hardware. Like Cerebras, they have taken different technical decisions to optimize certain particular aspects of the process, which allows them to do things in a fundamentally different way. In Groq's case, it's because they are entirely focused on inference level compute, not on training: all their special sauce hardware and software only give these huge speed and efficiency advantages when doing inference on an already trained model. But if the next big scaling law that people are excited about is for inference level compute— and if the biggest drawback of COT models is the high latency introduced by having to generate all those intermediate logic tokens before they can respond— then even a company that only does inference compute, but which does it dramatically faster and more efficiently than Nvidia can— can introduce a serious competitive threat in the coming years. At the very least, Cerebras and Groq can chip away at the lofty expectations for Nvidia's revenue growth over the next 2-3 years that are embedded in the current equity valuation. Besides these particularly innovative, if relatively unknown, startup competitors, there is some serious competition coming from some of Nvidia's biggest customers themselves who have been making custom silicon that specifically targets AI training and inference workloads. Perhaps the best known of these is Google, which has been developing its own proprietary TPUs since 2016. Interestingly, although it briefly sold TPUs to external customers, Google has been using all its TPUs internally for the past several years, and it is already on its 6th generation of TPU hardware. Amazon has also been developing its own custom chips called Trainium2 and Inferentia2. And while Amazon is building out data centers featuring billions of dollars of Nvidia GPUs, they are also at the same time investing many billions in other data centers that use these internal chips. They have one cluster that they are bringing online for Anthropic that features over 400k chips. Amazon gets a lot of flak for totally bungling their internal AI model development, squandering massive amounts of internal compute resources on models that ultimately are not competitive, but the custom silicon is another matter. Again, they don't necessarily need their chips to be better and faster than Nvidia's. What they need is for their chips to be good enough, but build them at a breakeven gross margin instead of the ~90%+ gross margin that Nvidia earns on its H100 business. OpenAI has also announced their plans to build custom chips, and they (together with Microsoft) are obviously the single largest user of Nvidia's data center hardware. As if that weren't enough, Microsoft have themselves announced their own custom chips! And Apple, the most valuable technology company in the world, has been blowing away expectations for years now with their highly innovative and disruptive custom silicon operation, which now completely trounces the CPUs from both Intel and AMD in terms of performance per watt, which is the most important factor in mobile (phone/tablet/laptop) applications. And they have been making their own internally designed GPUs and "Neural Processors" for years, even though they have yet to really demonstrate the utility of such chips outside of their own custom applications, like the advanced software based image processing used in the iPhone's camera. While Apple's focus seems somewhat orthogonal to these other players in terms of its mobile-first, consumer oriented, "edge compute" focus, if it ends up spending enough money on its new contract with OpenAI to provide AI services to iPhone users, you have to imagine that they have teams looking into making their own custom silicon for inference/training (although given their secrecy, you might never even know about it directly!). Now, it's no secret that there is a strong power law distribution of Nvidia's hyper-scaler customer base, with the top handful of customers representing the lion's share of high-margin revenue. How should one think about the future of this business when literally every single one of these VIP customers is building their own custom chips specifically for AI training and inference? When thinking about all this, you should keep one incredibly important thing in mind: Nvidia is largely an IP based company. They don't make their own chips. The true special sauce for making these incredible devices arguably comes more from TSMC, the actual fab, and ASML, which makes the special EUV lithography machines used by TSMC to make these leading-edge process node chips. And that's critically important, because TSMC will sell their most advanced chips to anyone who comes to them with enough up-front investment and is willing to guarantee a certain amount of volume. They don't care if it's for Bitcoin mining ASICs, GPUs, TPUs, mobile phone SoCs, etc. As much as senior chip designers at Nvidia earn per year, surely some of the best of them could be lured away by these other tech behemoths for enough cash and stock. And once they have a team and resources, they can design innovative chips (again, perhaps not even 50% as advanced as an H100, but with that Nvidia gross margin, there is plenty of room to work with) in 2 to 3 years, and thanks for TSMC, they can turn those into actual silicon using the exact same process node technology as Nvidia. As if these looming hardware threats weren't bad enough, there are a few developments in the software world in the last couple years that, while they started out slowly, are now picking up real steam and could pose a serious threat to the software dominance of Nvidia's CUDA. The first of these is the horrible Linux drivers for AMD GPUs. Remember we talked about how AMD has inexplicably allowed these drivers to suck for years despite leaving massive amounts of money on the table? Well, amusingly enough, the infamous hacker George Hotz (famous for jailbreaking the original iphone as a teenager, and currently the CEO of self-driving startup Comma.ai and AI computer company Tiny Corp, which also makes the open-source tinygrad AI software framework), recently announced that he was sick and tired of dealing with AMD's bad drivers, and desperately wanted to be able to to leverage the lower cost AMD GPUs in their TinyBox AI computers (which come in multiple flavors, some of which use Nvidia GPUs, and some of which use AMD GPUS). Well, he is making his own custom drivers and software stack for AMD GPUs without any help from AMD themselves; on Jan. 15th of 2025, he tweeted via his company's X account that "We are one piece away from a completely sovereign stack on AMD, the RDNA3 assembler. We have our own driver, runtime, libraries, and emulator. (all in ~12,000 lines!)" Given his track record and skills, it is likely that they will have this all working in the next couple months, and this would allow for a lot of exciting possibilities of using AMD GPUs for all sorts of applications where companies currently feel compelled to pay up for Nvidia GPUs. OK, well that's just a driver for AMD, and it's not even done yet. What else is there? Well, there are a few other areas on the software side that are a lot more impactful. For one, there is now a massive concerted effort across many large tech companies and the open source software community at large to make more generic AI software frameworks that have CUDA as just one of many "compilation targets". That is, you write your software using higher-level abstractions, and the system itself can automatically turn those high-level constructs into super well-tuned low-level code that works extremely well on CUDA. But because it's done at this higher level of abstraction, it can just as easily get compiled into low-level code that works extremely well on lots of other GPUs and TPUs from a variety of providers, such as the massive number of custom chips in the pipeline from every big tech company. The most famous examples of these frameworks are MLX (sponsored primarily by Apple), Triton (sponsored primarily by OpenAI), and JAX (developed by Google). MLX is particularly interesting because it provides a PyTorch-like API that can run efficiently on Apple Silicon, showing how these abstraction layers can enable AI workloads to run on completely different architectures. Triton, meanwhile, has become increasingly popular as it allows developers to write high-performance code that can be compiled to run on various hardware targets without having to understand the low-level details of each platform. These frameworks allow developers to write their code once using high powered abstractions and then target tons of platforms automatically— doesn't that sound like a better way to do things, which would give you a lot more flexibility in terms of how you actually run the code? In the 1980s, all the most popular, best selling software was written in hand-tuned assembly language. The PKZIP compression utility for example was hand crafted to maximize speed, to the point where a competently coded version written in the standard C programming language and compiled using the best available optimizing compilers at the time, would run at probably half the speed of the hand-tuned assembly code. The same is true for other popular software packages like WordStar, VisiCalc, and so on. Over time, compilers kept getting better and better, and every time the CPU architectures changed (say, from Intel releasing the 486, then the Pentium, and so on), that hand-rolled assembler would often have to be thrown out and rewritten, something that only the smartest coders were capable of (sort of like how CUDA experts are on a different level in the job market versus a "regular" software developer). Eventually, things converged so that the speed benefits of hand-rolled assembly were outweighed dramatically by the flexibility of being able to write code in a high-level language like C or C++, where you rely on the compiler to make things run really optimally on the given CPU. Nowadays, very little new code is written in assembly. I believe a similar transformation will end up happening for AI training and inference code, for similar reasons: computers are good at optimization, and flexibility and speed of development is increasingly the more important factor— especially if it also allows you to save dramatically on your hardware bill because you don't need to keep paying the "CUDA tax" that gives Nvidia 90%+ margins. Yet another area where you might see things change dramatically is that CUDA might very well end up being more of a high level abstraction itself— a "specification language" similar to Verilog (used as the industry standard to describe chip layouts) that skilled developers can use to describe high-level algorithms that involve massive parallelism (since they are already familiar with it, it's very well constructed, it's the lingua franca, etc.), but then instead of having that code compiled for use on Nvidia GPUs like you would normally do, it can instead be fed as source code into an LLM which can port it into whatever low-level code is understood by the new Cerebras chip, or the new Amazon Trainium2, or the new Google TPUv6, etc. This isn't as far off as you might think; it's probably already well within reach using OpenAI's latest O3 model, and surely will be possible generally within a year or two. Perhaps the most shocking development which was alluded to earlier happened in the last couple of weeks. And that is the news that has totally rocked the AI world, and which has been dominating the discourse among knowledgeable people on Twitter despite its complete absence from any of the mainstream media outlets: that a small Chinese startup called DeepSeek released two new models that have basically world-competitive performance levels on par with the best models from OpenAI and Anthropic (blowing past the Meta Llama3 models and other smaller open source model players such as Mistral). These models are called DeepSeek-V3 (basically their answer to GPT-4o and Claude3.5 Sonnet) and DeepSeek-R1 (basically their answer to OpenAI's O1 model). Why is this all so shocking? Well, first of all, DeepSeek is a tiny Chinese company that reportedly has under 200 employees. The story goes that they started out as a quant trading hedge fund similar to TwoSigma or RenTec, but after Xi Jinping cracked down on that space, they used their math and engineering chops to pivot into AI research. Who knows if any of that is really true or if they are merely some kind of front for the CCP or the Chinese military. But the fact remains that they have released two incredibly detailed technical reports, for DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeekR1. These are heavy technical reports, and if you don't know a lot of linear algebra, you probably won't understand much. But what you should really try is to download the free DeepSeek app on the AppStore here and install it using a Google account to log in and give it a try (you can also install it on Android here), or simply try it out on your desktop computer in the browser here. Make sure to select the "DeepThink" option to enable chain-of-thought (the R1 model) and ask it to explain parts of the technical reports in simple terms. This will simultaneously show you a few important things: One, this model is absolutely legit. There is a lot of BS that goes on with AI benchmarks, which are routinely gamed so that models appear to perform great on the benchmarks but then suck in real world tests. Google is certainly the worst offender in this regard, constantly crowing about how amazing their LLMs are, when they are so awful in any real world test that they can't even reliably accomplish the simplest possible tasks, let alone challenging coding tasks. These DeepSeek models are not like that— the responses are coherent, compelling, and absolutely on the same level as those from OpenAI and Anthropic. Two, that DeepSeek has made profound advancements not just in model quality, but more importantly in model training and inference efficiency. By being extremely close to the hardware and by layering together a handful of distinct, very clever optimizations, DeepSeek was able to train these incredible models using GPUs in a dramatically more efficient way. By some measurements, over ~45x more efficiently than other leading-edge models. DeepSeek claims that the complete cost to train DeepSeek-V3 was just over $5mm. That is absolutely nothing by the standards of OpenAI, Anthropic, etc., which were well into the $100mm+ level for training costs for a single model as early as 2024. How in the world could this be possible? How could this little Chinese company completely upstage all the smartest minds at our leading AI labs, which have 100 times more resources, headcount, payroll, capital, GPUs, etc? Wasn't China supposed to be crippled by Biden's restriction on GPU exports? Well, the details are fairly technical, but we can at least describe them at a high level. It might have just turned out that the relative GPU processing poverty of DeepSeek was the critical ingredient to make them more creative and clever, necessity being the mother of invention and all. A major innovation is their sophisticated mixed-precision training framework that lets them use 8-bit floating point numbers (FP8) throughout the entire training process. Most Western AI labs train using "full precision" 32-bit numbers (this basically specifies the number of gradations possible in describing the output of an artificial neuron; 8 bits in FP8 lets you store a much wider range of numbers than you might expect— it's not just limited to 256 different equal-sized magnitudes like you'd get with regular integers, but instead uses clever math tricks to store both very small and very large numbers— though naturally with less precision than you'd get with 32 bits.) The main tradeoff is that while FP32 can store numbers with incredible precision across an enormous range, FP8 sacrifices some of that precision to save memory and boost performance, while still maintaining enough accuracy for many AI workloads. DeepSeek cracked this problem by developing a clever system that breaks numbers into small tiles for activations and blocks for weights, and strategically uses high-precision calculations at key points in the network. Unlike other labs that train in high precision and then compress later (losing some quality in the process), DeepSeek's native FP8 approach means they get the massive memory savings without compromising performance. When you're training across thousands of GPUs, this dramatic reduction in memory requirements per GPU translates into needing far fewer GPUs overall. Another major breakthrough is their multi-token prediction system. Most Transformer based LLM models do inference by predicting the next token— one token at a time. DeepSeek figured out how to predict multiple tokens while maintaining the quality you'd get from single-token prediction. Their approach achieves about 85-90% accuracy on these additional token predictions, which effectively doubles inference speed without sacrificing much quality. The clever part is they maintain the complete causal chain of predictions, so the model isn't just guessing— it's making structured, contextual predictions. One of their most innovative developments is what they call Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA). This is a breakthrough in how they handle what are called the Key-Value indices, which are basically how individual tokens are represented in the attention mechanism within the Transformer architecture. Although this is getting a bit too advanced in technical terms, suffice it to say that these KV indices are some of the major uses of VRAM during the training and inference process, and part of the reason why you need to use thousands of GPUs at the same time to train these models— each GPU has a maximum of 96 gb of VRAM, and these indices eat that memory up for breakfast. Their MLA system finds a way to store a compressed version of these indices that captures the essential information while using far less memory. The brilliant part is this compression is built directly into how the model learns— it's not some separate step they need to do, it's built directly into the end-to-end training pipeline. This means that the entire mechanism is "differentiable" and able to be trained directly using the standard optimizers. All this stuff works because these models are ultimately finding much lower-dimensional representations of the underlying data than the so-called "ambient dimensions". So it's wasteful to store the full KV indices, even though that is basically what everyone else does. Not only do you end up wasting tons of space by storing way more numbers than you need, which gives a massive boost to the training memory footprint and efficiency (again, slashing the number of GPUs you need to train a world class model), but it can actually end up improving model quality because it can act like a "regularizer," forcing the model to pay attention to the truly important stuff instead of using the wasted capacity to fit to noise in the training data. So not only do you save a ton of memory, but the model might even perform better. At the very least, you don't get a massive hit to performance in exchange for the huge memory savings, which is generally the kind of tradeoff you are faced with in AI training. They also made major advances in GPU communication efficiency through their DualPipe algorithm and custom communication kernels. This system intelligently overlaps computation and communication, carefully balancing GPU resources between these tasks. They only need about 20 of their GPUs' streaming multiprocessors (SMs) for communication, leaving the rest free for computation. The result is much higher GPU utilization than typical training setups achieve. Another very smart thing they did is to use what is known as a Mixture-of-Experts (MOE) Transformer architecture, but with key innovations around load balancing. As you might know, the size or capacity of an AI model is often measured in terms of the number of parameters the model contains. A parameter is just a number that stores some attribute of the model; either the "weight" or importance a particular artificial neuron has relative to another one, or the importance of a particular token depending on its context (in the "attention mechanism"), etc. Meta's latest Llama3 models come in a few sizes, for example: a 1 billion parameter version (the smallest), a 70B parameter model (the most commonly deployed one), and even a massive 405B parameter model. This largest model is of limited utility for most users because you would need to have tens of thousands of dollars worth of GPUs in your computer just to run at tolerable speeds for inference, at least if you deployed it in the naive full-precision version. Therefore most of the real-world usage and excitement surrounding these open source models is at the 8B parameter or highly quantized 70B parameter level, since that's what can fit in a consumer-grade Nvidia 4090 GPU, which you can buy now for under $1,000. So why does any of this matter? Well, in a sense, the parameter count and precision tells you something about how much raw information or data the model has stored internally. Note that I'm not talking about reasoning ability, or the model's "IQ" if you will: it turns out that models with even surprisingly modest parameter counts can show remarkable cognitive performance when it comes to solving complex logic problems, proving theorems in plane geometry, SAT math problems, etc. But those small models aren't going to be able to necessarily tell you every aspect of every plot twist in every single novel by Stendhal, whereas the really big models can potentially do that. The "cost" of that extreme level of knowledge is that the models become very unwieldy both to train and to do inference on, because you always need to store every single one of those 405B parameters (or whatever the parameter count is) in the GPU's VRAM at the same time in order to do any inference with the model. The beauty of the MOE model approach is that you can decompose the big model into a collection of smaller models that each know different, non-overlapping (at least fully) pieces of knowledge. DeepSeek's innovation here was developing what they call an "auxiliary-loss-free" load balancing strategy that maintains efficient expert utilization without the usual performance degradation that comes from load balancing. Then, depending on the nature of the inference request, you can intelligently route the inference to the "expert" models within that collection of smaller models that are most able to answer that question or solve that task. You can loosely think of it as being a committee of experts who have their own specialized knowledge domains: one might be a legal expert, the other a computer science expert, the other a business strategy expert. So if a question comes in about linear algebra, you don't give it to the legal expert. This is of course a very loose analogy and it doesn't actually work like this in practice. The real advantage of this approach is that it allows the model to contain a huge amount of knowledge without being very unwieldy, because even though the aggregate number of parameters is high across all the experts, only a small subset of these parameters is "active" at any given time, which means that you only need to store this small subset of weights in VRAM in order to do inference. In the case of DeepSeek-V3, they have an absolutely massive MOE model with 671B parameters, so it's much bigger than even the largest Llama3 model, but only 37B of these parameters are active at any given time— enough to fit in the VRAM of two consumer-grade Nvidia 4090 GPUs (under $2,000 total cost), rather than requiring one or more H100 GPUs which cost something like $40k each. It's rumored that both ChatGPT and Claude use an MoE architecture, with some leaks suggesting that GPT-4 had a total of 1.8 trillion parameters split across 8 models containing 220 billion parameters each. Despite that being a lot more doable than trying to fit all 1.8 trillion parameters in VRAM, it still requires multiple H100-grade GPUs just to run the model because of the massive amount of memory used. Beyond what has already been described, the technical papers mention several other key optimizations. These include their extremely memory-efficient training framework that avoids tensor parallelism, recomputes certain operations during backpropagation instead of storing them, and shares parameters between the main model and auxiliary prediction modules. The sum total of all these innovations, when layered together, has led to the ~45x efficiency improvement numbers that have been tossed around online, and I am perfectly willing to believe these are in the right ballpark. One very strong indicator that it's true is the cost of DeepSeek's API: despite this nearly best-in-class model performance, DeepSeek charges something like 95% less money for inference requests via its API than comparable models from OpenAI and Anthropic. In a sense, it's sort of like comparing Nvidia's GPUs to the new custom chips from competitors: even if they aren't quite as good, the value for money is so much better that it can still be a no-brainer depending on the application, as long as you can qualify the performance level and prove that it's good enough for your requirements and the API availability and latency is good enough (thus far, people have been amazed at how well DeepSeek's infrastructure has held up despite the truly incredible surge of demand owing to the performance of these new models). But unlike the case of Nvidia, where the cost differential is the result of them earning monopoly gross margins of 90%+ on their data-center products, the cost differential of the DeepSeek API relative to the OpenAI and Anthropic API could be simply that they are nearly 50x more compute efficient (it might even be significantly more than that on the inference side— the ~45x efficiency was on the training side). Indeed, it's not even clear that OpenAI and Anthropic are making great margins on their API services— they might be more interested in revenue growth and gathering more data from analyzing all the API requests they receive. Before moving on, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that many people are speculating that DeepSeek is simply lying about the number of GPUs and GPU hours spent training these models because they actually possess far more H100s than they are supposed to have given the export restrictions on these cards, and they don't want to cause trouble for themselves or hurt their chances of acquiring more of these cards. While it's certainly possible, I think it's more likely that they are telling the truth, and that they have simply been able to achieve these incredible results by being extremely clever and creative in their approach to training and inference. They explain how they are doing things, and I suspect that it's only a matter of time before their results are widely replicated and confirmed by other researchers at various other labs. The newer R1 model and technical report might even be even more mind blowing, since they were able to beat Anthropic to Chain-of-thought and now are basically the only ones besides OpenAI who have made this technology work at scale. But note that the O1 preview model was only released by OpenAI in mid-September of 2024. That's only ~4 months ago! Something you absolutely must keep in mind is that, unlike OpenAI, which is incredibly secretive about how these models really work at a low level, and won't release the actual model weights to anyone besides partners like Microsoft and other who sign heavy-duty NDAs, these DeepSeek models are both completely open-source and permissively licensed. They have released extremely detailed technical reports explaining how they work, as well as the code that anyone can look at and try to copy. With R1, DeepSeek essentially cracked one of the holy grails of AI: getting models to reason step-by-step without relying on massive supervised datasets. Their DeepSeek-R1-Zero experiment showed something remarkable: using pure reinforcement learning with carefully crafted reward functions, they managed to get models to develop sophisticated reasoning capabilities completely autonomously. This wasn't just about solving problems— the model organically learned to generate long chains of thought, self-verify its work, and allocate more computation time to harder problems. The technical breakthrough here was their novel approach to reward modeling. Rather than using complex neural reward models that can lead to "reward hacking" (where the model finds bogus ways to boost their rewards that don't actually lead to better real-world model performance), they developed a clever rule-based system that combines accuracy rewards (verifying final answers) with format rewards (encouraging structured thinking). This simpler approach turned out to be more robust and scalable than the process-based reward models that others have tried. What's particularly fascinating is that during training, they observed what they called an "aha moment," a phase where the model spontaneously learned to revise its thinking process mid-stream when encountering uncertainty. This emergent behavior wasn't explicitly programmed; it arose naturally from the interaction between the model and the reinforcement learning environment. The model would literally stop itself, flag potential issues in its reasoning, and restart with a different approach, all without being explicitly trained to do this. The full R1 model built on these insights by introducing what they call "cold-start" data— a small set of high-quality examples— before applying their RL techniques. They also solved one of the major challenges in reasoning models: language consistency. Previous attempts at chain-of-thought reasoning often resulted in models mixing languages or producing incoherent outputs. DeepSeek solved this through a clever language consistency reward during RL training, trading off a small performance hit for much more readable and consistent outputs. The results are mind-boggling: on AIME 2024, one of the most challenging high school math competitions, R1 achieved 79.8% accuracy, matching OpenAI's O1 model. On MATH-500, it hit 97.3%, and it achieved the 96.3 percentile on Codeforces programming competitions. But perhaps most impressively, they managed to distill these capabilities down to much smaller models: their 14B parameter version outperforms many models several times its size, suggesting that reasoning ability isn't just about raw parameter count but about how you train the model to process information. The recent scuttlebutt on Twitter and Blind (a corporate rumor website) is that these models caught Meta completely off guard and that they perform better than the new Llama4 models which are still being trained. Apparently, the Llama project within Meta has attracted a lot of attention internally from high-ranking technical executives, and as a result they have something like 13 individuals working on the Llama stuff who each individually earn more per year in total compensation than the combined training cost for the DeepSeek-V3 models which outperform it. How do you explain that to Zuck with a straight face? How does Zuck keep smiling while shoveling multiple billions of dollars to Nvidia to buy 100k H100s when a better model was trained using just 2k H100s for a bit over $5mm? But you better believe that Meta and every other big AI lab is taking these DeepSeek models apart, studying every word in those technical reports and every line of the open source code they released, trying desperately to integrate these same tricks and optimizations into their own training and inference pipelines. So what's the impact of all that? Well, naively it sort of seems like the aggregate demand for training and inference compute should be divided by some big number. Maybe not by 45, but maybe by 25 or even 30? Because whatever you thought you needed before these model releases, it's now a lot less. Now, an optimist might say "You are talking about a mere constant of proportionality, a single multiple. When you're dealing with an exponential growth curve, that stuff gets washed out so quickly that it doesn't end up matter all that much." And there is some truth to that: if AI really is as transformational as I expect, if the real-world utility of this tech is measured in the trillions, if inference-time compute is the new scaling law of the land, if we are going to have armies of humanoid robots running around doing massive amounts of inference constantly, then maybe the growth curve is still so steep and extreme, and Nvidia has a big enough lead, that it will still work out. But Nvidia is pricing in a LOT of good news in the coming years for that valuation to make sense, and when you start layering all these things together into a total mosaic, it starts to make me at least feel extremely uneasy about spending ~20x the 2025 estimated sales for their shares. What happens if you even see a slight moderation in sales growth? What if it turns out to be 85% instead of over 100%? What if gross margins come in a bit from 75% to 70%— still ridiculously high for a semiconductor company? At a high level, NVIDIA faces an unprecedented convergence of competitive threats that make its premium valuation increasingly difficult to justify at 20x forward sales and 75% gross margins. The company's supposed moats in hardware, software, and efficiency are all showing concerning cracks. The whole world— thousands of the smartest people on the planet, backed by untold billions of dollars of capital resources— are trying to assail them from every angle. On the hardware front, innovative architectures from Cerebras and Groq demonstrate that NVIDIA's interconnect advantage— a cornerstone of its data center dominance— can be circumvented through radical redesigns. Cerebras' wafer-scale chips and Groq's deterministic compute approach deliver compelling performance without needing NVIDIA's complex interconnect solutions. More traditionally, every major NVIDIA customer (Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Apple) is developing custom silicon that could chip away at high-margin data center revenue. These aren't experimental projects anymore— Amazon alone is building out massive infrastructure with over 400,000 custom chips for Anthropic. The software moat appears equally vulnerable. New high-level frameworks like MLX, Triton, and JAX are abstracting away CUDA's importance, while efforts to improve AMD drivers could unlock much cheaper hardware alternatives. The trend toward higher-level abstractions mirrors how assembly language gave way to C/C++, suggesting CUDA's dominance may be more temporary than assumed. Most importantly, we're seeing the emergence of LLM-powered code translation that could automatically port CUDA code to run on any hardware target, potentially eliminating one of NVIDIA's strongest lock-in effects. Perhaps most devastating is DeepSeek's recent efficiency breakthrough, achieving comparable model performance at approximately 1/45th the compute cost. This suggests the entire industry has been massively over-provisioning compute resources. Combined with the emergence of more efficient inference architectures through chain-of-thought models, the aggregate demand for compute could be significantly lower than current projections assume. The economics here are compelling: when DeepSeek can match GPT-4 level performance while charging 95% less for API calls, it suggests either NVIDIA's customers are burning cash unnecessarily or margins must come down dramatically. The fact that TSMC will manufacture competitive chips for any well-funded customer puts a natural ceiling on NVIDIA's architectural advantages. But more fundamentally, history shows that markets eventually find a way around artificial bottlenecks that generate super-normal profits. When layered together, these threats suggest NVIDIA faces a much rockier path to maintaining its current growth trajectory and margins than its valuation implies. With five distinct vectors of attack— architectural innovation, customer vertical integration, software abstraction, efficiency breakthroughs, and manufacturing democratization— the probability that at least one succeeds in meaningfully impacting NVIDIA's margins or growth rate seems high. At current valuations, the market isn't pricing in any of these risks. I hope you enjoyed reading this article.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against other top trending AI stocks on Wall Street. President Donald Trump has recently announced a private sector investment to build more AI data centers, marking yet another effort by the US government to stay ahead in the race for supremacy in artificial intelligence. A prominent player in the field has been OpenAI, the artificial intelligence startup known to have started the AI arms race in the first place. In its latest, OpenAI has recently previewed an AI agent that can carry out tasks on the web for users. This move seeks to enhance its chatbot amidst intensifying competition. READ ALSO: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings and 11 AI Stocks That Should Be On Your Watchlist Dubbed the “Operator”, the tool is powered by a model that allows it to interact with on-screen buttons, menus, and text fields. “This capability marks the next step in AI development, allowing models to use the same tools humans rely on daily and opening the door to a vast range of new applications”. OpenAI says Operator is “an agent that can go to the web to perform tasks for you”. As such, companies are increasingly using agents like these to assist in tasks and execute actions without direct human intervention. Currently available to Pro users in the US, the Operator can perform numerous tasks, such as creating to-do lists or assisting in planning vacations. The company states that it eventually plans to expand the Operator to Plus, Team, and Enterprise users and will be integrating Operator into ChatGPT. It also revealed how the tool currently faces trouble with some tasks, such as managing calendars and creating slideshows. “Operator is one of our first agents, which are AIs capable of doing work for you independently. You give it a task and it will execute it”. Based on trends in artificial intelligence, agents are the next big advancement in the AI field. Even Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang agrees that they are. Artificial Intelligence agents are autonomous intelligent systems that can perform specific tasks without human intervention. “AI agents are going to get deployed. I think this year we’re going to see it take off”. According to him, areas such as software engineering, digital marketing, and customer service are the first where AI agents can add value. As for his company, it is already using AI agents in chip design. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 235 Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a global technology company. On January 23, Bank of America reiterated the stock as “Buy” and raised its price target to $710 per share from $660. The firm is bullish on the company, citing its strong cost discipline and artificial intelligence capabilities. The firm said it is important for Meta (NASDAQ:META) to demonstrate a return on investment in AI, particularly in the months ahead. The analyst also highlighted how advertising revenue across platforms such as Facebook and Instagram is important for the company’s financial health and share prices. Short-term investors will be closely watching AI-driven revenue growth this year. “With a stable macro backdrop, a growing AI contribution to ad revenues, ramping messaging revenues, and continued cost discipline (recent headcount cuts), we remain positive on the stock in 2025”. Overall, META ranks 1st on our list of top trending AI stocks on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: The AI spending frenzy is just getting started
URL: https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/24/24351418/project-stargate-openai-spending-meta-microsoft
Time Published: 2025-01-25T00:15:57Z
Full Content:
By Alex Heath, a deputy editor and author of the Command Line newsletter. He has over a decade of experience covering the tech industry. “All I know is I’m good for my $80 billion.” Rarely does a one-liner so perfectly capture the state of the moment. Here, you have Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella saying he’s “not in the details” about Stargate, the supposedly multi-hundred-billion AI infrastructure project driven by his marquee investment, OpenAI. Nadella not being read in on the nebulous details of Stargate says a lot about how much Microsoft and OpenAI have drifted apart. Microsoft is mentioned in the Stargate press release since OpenAI’s models are still exclusive to Azure. But the most striking aspect of Stargate is not that the money isn’t there for it yet; it’s that OpenAI’s biggest backer has decided to not participate in what Sam Altman is calling “the most important project of this era.” As Nadella made clear on CNBC this week, he’s running his own, $80 billion AI infrastructure buildout and, going forward, OpenAI can get additional compute — with his blessing — elsewhere. While it received fewer headlines this week, I found Nadella’s response to Elon Musk on X even more illuminating. In his response to Musk saying, “on the other hand, Satya definitely does have the money,” Nadella responded: “😂 And all this money is not about hyping AI, but is about building useful things for the real world!” That post can only be interpreted as a dig at Altman. Nadella could have funded Stargate for OpenAI. He didn’t. What does he know that the rest of us don’t? The splashy Stargate unveiling at the White House certainly accomplished its goal, which was clearly getting everyone to talk about big numbers. The headlines it generated prompted Mark Zuckerberg to make sure everyone ended the week knowing his data center will be even bigger than Stargate. In a Friday post on his Facebook page, Zuckerberg said that Meta’s planned 2GW data center in Louisiana “is so large it would cover a significant part of Manhattan,” with a map view of the square footage overlaid on the city to send the point home. From his post (my emphasis added): “We’ll bring online ~1GW of compute in ‘25 and we’ll end the year with more than 1.3 million GPUs. We’re planning to invest $60-65B in capex this year while also growing our AI teams significantly, and we have the capital to continue investing in the years ahead.” I have no doubt that Altman, Masayoshi Son, and Larry Ellison will be able to raise the billions they need to lessen OpenAI’s dependence on Microsoft for compute. (The US government isn’t giving money to Stargate, which makes the optics of announcing it alongside Trump all the more bizarre.) Ultimately, this all points to the theme that is quickly coming to define 2025: Big Tech sees AI as the most existential technology of the coming era and will keep spending like hell to make sure OpenAI doesn’t completely run away with it. Few companies had as good of a 2024 as Reddit. Since going public last March, the company’s stock has soared 300 percent, giving the social network a valuation of $32 billion. It’s an about-face from where Reddit was before going public, when its moderators were raging against its hurried platform changes and there was backlash to the company selling its data to Google and OpenAI. With those controversies now seemingly in the rear-view mirror, Reddit is focused on growing its user base, staying profitable, and using AI to help people search its site more easily. I caught up with CEO Steve Huffman at CES a few weeks ago to hear his priorities for 2025, how he’s leading Reddit, his thoughts on the AI scaling debate, content moderation, and more… The following interview has been edited for length and clarity: Your IPO did very well. What have the last nine months or so been like for you personally? We have a saying at Reddit that good numbers make good meetings. So we’ve had some good meetings. Preparing to go public was intense. It’s telling the story over and over and over, which I enjoy doing, but it’s a lot of work. I think more than most new companies, we are in the public company rhythm already: close the quarter, do the audits, do the board meeting, earnings, and all of that. So it hasn’t been a major change for us from an operating point of view. It’s a really exciting time for the new investors and employees. You won’t catch us complaining. What I keep telling the company is that everyone should be very proud of the work they’ve done and don’t take these moments for granted. I just tell them, look, enjoy the view. If you look at our history, there are lots of ups and downs. No doubt there are challenges in our future. With your market cap where it is now, are you thinking of making swings you didn’t think you could make a year ago? There are two classes of things that we would do. One is to execute the core strategy. We’ve got to hire. We’ve got to build. I think we’re very reasonable in terms of our investment size. The one sentence strategy for us is to grow the product and stay profitable. What can you do with a high stock price? Maybe you can look at M&A that you wouldn’t otherwise. I’d say that’s not really our orientation right now because the acquisitions we’ve done over the last two years have been these 25-to-50-million-dollar deals. It’s kind of a sweet spot for us to get tech and teams. I’d say we’re always watching the market, but we’re not pursuing anything big or crazy right now because I like the core strategy. I think we can do what we want to do within our current capabilities. What’s the main product focus for Reddit this year? The first is the core of Reddit, which is community conversations. Everyone has a home on Reddit, but do you see that home in your first session? There’s a whole other dimension to our work, which is Reddit as an information source. Reddit has all of this incredible information. For the users who have a question that needs an answer, can we give them that answer? We just got into testing Reddit Answers. I’m finding that really helpful for searches about current events. A year from now, it’s a monetization product. It’s one of the few products where it kind of scratches every itch, so it’ll be a big focus. What do you make of this debate about whether the AI industry has run out of data? I think we’d have a different answer to that question literally every month. We want to have good relationships with other people in this space. We’re open for business. At the same time, we want to maximize the value we get out of our own data. We have not experienced conflict between the two at this point. I love the [data licensing] relationships we have — the major ones being Google and OpenAI. At this point, we don’t need to make any particular partnership. I’d say they’re all nice to have but nothing is existential for us. One of the challenges is that the AI companies don’t know what product they’re building. It’s not a bad thing. They are iterating themselves. ChatGPT itself, the central product in this conversation, was a demo. Then, a year later, it’s the most important piece of enterprise technology on Earth with questionable economics. That makes it very exciting. I don’t think any of these companies would be offended to hear me say that. You were one of the first social media CEOs I saw to be very critical of TikTok. How does a US ban affect Reddit? If you look at Reddit’s traffic graph over the last 19 years, you will not see the rise and fall of any particular platform. I think every content type should work on Reddit. Video on Reddit is largely camera-out — what I’m looking at — as opposed to camera-in, or who am I? That’s social media. I think the ban is the right thing to do for reasons I’ve mentioned that honestly have nothing to do with competition. With Meta’s moderation changes, the broader conversation around social media feels like it’s changing right now. For the last 10 years, people have been talking about whether speech is the problem, which is a crazy thought. You can’t have freedom without speech. I think that detour through questioning and relitigating core values of America, hopefully that era is coming to a close. Are people playing politics? Of course, people always are. On the topic of moderation, we always just try to do things the right way, which, not coincidentally, are aligned with American values. It’s a Democratic platform. We believe very much in the power of people and the wisdom of crowds and voting processes. That is Reddit. So I’m glad to see a return to where we have been most of my life, which is an appreciation for free speech.

Investors should not to make any major moves, he advised. "Look it's a sheer hell week. Our heads will be spinning, swivel-like, lazy Susan even, as each day you can expect a flood of earnings and a sound bite from President Trump that upsets whatever order there might be," he said. "Like I always say, don't try to make decisions during this part of earnings season, just listen." On Monday, Cramer will review earnings from SoFi and AT&T. Cramer said he expects good numbers from the fintech company, even as the stock has been heavily shorted. AT&T should also do well, he added, judging by decent results from its peer Verizon. Tuesday brings a report from General Motors. Cramer said the company is likely to deliver solid results, the stock may decline because the market is focused on Tesla when it comes to the auto industry. Starbucks also reports on Tuesday, and Cramer said he's optimistic about new CEO Brian Niccol's vision for the coffee chain. Niccol was able to transform Chipotle, and Cramer said Starbucks could be worth buying after the CEO lays out his plan. Wednesday is packed. The Fed will reveal its latest decision on interest rates. Cramer said he doesn't expect a cut when employment seems so strong. T-Mobile and ServiceNow will report their fourth quarter earnings. Cramer anticipates T-Mobile heading higher, while ServiceNow might be a buy if it dips after the release. Tech behemoths Microsoft and Meta are also reporting, and Cramer called both companies' quarters wild cards. Plus, there's Tesla earnings. Cramer noted that even when it missed last quarter, the stock still climbed, so he recommended owning it. Caterpillar reports on Thursday, and Cramer said the company has managed to lean into secular growth instead of just cyclicality. Apple also reports on Thursday. Cramer acknowledged that Wall Street is expecting a miss, but he said it's still a good stock to own long term. He believes the company will be able to fix any problems it might currently be facing. Intel is set to release earnings as well. Cramer said it needs to raise cash and fix its balance sheet before investors should own the stock. Finally, Friday has reports from Chevron and Exxon Mobil. Cramer said he doesn't want to own the oil giants because they might ramp up drilling now that President Donald Trump has relaxed federal regulations. The Labor Department will also release the personal consumption expenditures price index, an important inflation metric for the Fed, on Friday. "I think it won't be cool enough. Too much spending for that to happen," Cramer said. Click here to download Jim Cramer's Guide to Investing at no cost to help you build long-term wealth and invest smarter.

This story incorporates reporting from Business Insider, TheStreet on MSN.com and Investor’s Business Daily on MSN.com.Analysts have updated their outlooks on Meta Platforms stock following an announcement from CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasizing the company’s intensified focus on artificial intelligence. Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion maintained a Buy rating for Meta, holding firm on a $670 price target. Champion’s position reflects confidence in Meta’s strategic direction, emphasizing the company’s capital investments in AI technologies. The announcement underscores Meta’s ambition to position AI centrally in its growth strategy, particularly with the development of Meta AI — a virtual assistant expected to engage over a billion users. Bank of America Securities has also expressed optimism, assigning a Buy rating with a higher $710 price target. This reflects recognition of Meta’s potential for scaling AI applications within social media and digital advertising — a sector in which Meta has already established a dominant presence. Meta, previously known as Facebook, continues to explore new technologies, with AI at the forefront of these efforts. The strategic focus on AI by Zuckerberg is poised to potentially influence investor sentiment and may further enhance Meta’s competitive edge. Quartz Intelligence Newsroom uses generative artificial intelligence to report on business trends. This is the first phase of an experimental new version of reporting.

Vorrath has been instrumental in the development of several of Apple’s major products, from managing the initial iPhone software to supervising the operating systems for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Her most recent project involved software development for the Vision Pro spatial computing headset. Mark Gurman for Bloomberg News: ‎ The move helps bolster a team that’s racing to make Apple a leader in AI — an area where it’s fallen behind technology peers. The company has struggled to match the capabilities of OpenAI, Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. And its Apple Intelligence platform has suffered from a slow and bumpy rollout. The Siri digital assistant, groundbreaking when it was unveiled in 2011, has come to symbolize Apple’s shortcomings in AI. Upstarts like OpenAI have created their own, more versatile chatbots, and smartphone rival Samsung Electronics Co. has been faster to weave artificial intelligence features into its software. Amazon.com Inc. also is adapting its Alexa platform for the AI world. Vorrath joins the new team from Apple’s hardware engineering division, where she helped launch the Vision Pro headset… The move signals that AI is now more important than the Vision Pro, which launched in February 2024, and is seen as the biggest challenge within the company, according to a longtime Apple executive who asked not to be identified… It has been clear for some time now that Giannandrea needs additional help managing an AI group with growing prominence, according to the executive. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: At this point, sigh, we’ll just wish good luck to Vorrath and review: Apple pays and has been paying John Giannandrea, Senior Vice President of Machine Learning and AI Strategy, millions upon millions of dollars for years. WTF of any import does he really do? WTF of any import has he really delivered? Have you used Siri lately? Yup, it’s still a steaming pile of dogshit. Where’s Apple’s generative AI, John? “Too hard; too late; look for partners; gimme my paycheck and stock options.” AAPL shareholders need to start asking real questions of these executives, especially those who are supposed in charge of Apple’s “AI Strategy,” when the company clearly has none. How about some accountability for once? – MacDailyNews, March 18, 2024 Note: Apple’s (virtual, of course) 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders is scheduled for February 25, 2025 at 8:00 am P.T. Apple was caught flat-footed, due to a lack of vision on the part of leadership… So, the only solution is to partner with a [Google, OpenAI, Baidu, etc.] for the real GenAI stuff while pretending (marketing) really hard that some on-device AI Apple has whipped up in a few months is “insanely great Apple innovation” that’s at the heart of Apple’s 2024’s AI announcements when it’s really just an adjunct… Watch Apple make a big show of its on-device AI at WWDC and run many ads touting it from June onwards. Apple hopes to buy time for the data center buildouts and investments that will be required for them to someday own their own AI technology and not have to license it from the likes of [Google, OpenAI, Baidu, etc.]. This is what happens after a decade plus with a caretaker CEO at the helm after he hits the last page of his iteration playbook, yet attempts to stay in the game for too long. – MacDailyNews, April 1, 2024 Clearly, Apple is not as innovative as it was under Steve Jobs who even started the company’s work on Apple Silicon, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision Pro, but, thanks to Jobs and Cook’s subsequent management of iterations of products and services conceived during Jobs’ tenure, including the retail store buildout which is responsible for a significant portion of Apple’s growth, the company now has more than enough money to make up for Cook’s lack of vision. – MacDailyNews, April 23, 2024 The new “AI features” for iOS, iPadOS, and MacOS to be revealed at WWDC is mainly a marketing exercise. The pressure is on Apple’s marketing team to position the company as an innovator in the space (“only Apple does so much on-device AI which enhances users’ privacy to ‘stunning’ effect,” etc.) that also makes “smart partnerships” with other AI companies (OpenAI, for example; even though it’s currently forced to partner if they want to offer any real GenAI features). Now, more than ever, finding themselves so far behind, Apple needs to sell, sell, sell! – MacDailyNews, May 28, 2024 When you’re caught flat-footed like Tim Cook’s Apple, you pop into scramble mode to try to catch up. Early on, you hit it with a big marketing flourish (WWDC24) in order to buy some more time. Then you dribble out features as they get finished and actually exist. Classic vaporware. – MadDailyNews, July 31, 2024 MacDailyNews, September 10, 2024: ‎ Executing a vaporware strategy is an unfortunate necessity without a visionary CEO and it takes time to actually realize (code, test, build out datacenter infrastructure, etc.) a grand marketing vision. You know, some people get upset when we point out that Tim Cook is a boring, reactive caretaker who’s not really the best person to be running Apple today or for at least the past several years. Operations manager Cook should have been a 3-5 year stopgap after Steve Jobs’ untimely passing, running the iteration playbook, providing continuity for the company while it found a real CEO. Instead, he hung on — and keeps hanging on — well past his sell-by date. Sigh. You can be upset with us for having the temerity to call it like we see it, but the fact remains that Apple would be doing significantly better today with a visionary who’d have seen AI on the horizon, who’d have recognized the intrinsic importance of Siri and therefore invested in it instead of criminally neglecting it, and who wouldn’t have squandered the company’s gigantic leads in things like personal assistants and podcasting. – MacDailyNews, August 22, 2024 Larger displays on iPhone 16 Pro models, and hundreds of millions of iPhones that are 4+ years old, will do the heavy lifting for iPhone sales and iPhone’s average selling price (ASP). Until it gets another visionary leader (fingers crossed; Apple’s history has shown – cough, Sculley, Spindler, cough – that the next CEO could be far, far worse than the very competent caretaker Cook), Apple can afford to miss things like generative AI – which they clearly did – and then use its huge war chest to catch up – which they’re doing right now (fun times and 80-hour weeks inside Apple Park!) – and, hopefully, [someday] surpass rivals (or at least be as good). Apple will very likely unveil their catch-up work within months (this June at WWDC 2024) in iPhones (and iPads, Apple Watches, etc.) with built-in on-device generative AI and other new AI-driven features. – MacDailyNews, February 14, 2024 Apple needed new blood years ago, but the old blood simply won’t let go. – MacDailyNews, January 22, 2025 We are currently about 1/4th of the way to being sustainable with Substack subscriptions.

It’s obvious, Tim Cook prioritizes shareholder delight over customer delight and as long as he’s delivering on shareholder value, shareholders won’t question anything. They only care about milking Apple for what it’s worth. The Board is no different. And this is sad, actually. Apple Intelligence and Siri are utterly useless.. .Damn shame how pathetic it is.. At least 50% of the time I can’t even get “stupid ass” (SIRI) to call someone… It just glows.. Cook needs to go.. Sometimes I wonder if Rim Cock and the other Apple execs even use Siri. Do they have any idea? Can’t believe the comments here…lots of ingrates. I can only imagine…none of you know how good the emojis are? They make me a fulfilled human being. Thank you Tim. I don’t care if you’re not a product guy. Women never solve anything. This is just DEI. So Apple Intelligence was all spin, no substance after all? In my use it is better than old Siri bit not dramatically so. The things i’ve always used it for are more reliable. There are still things though that should be automatic (the age of some prominent politician for example) but still aren’t. It feels like Apple is erring on the side of extreme caution rather than risk mistakes like with the News summaries controversy. The question is whether we’ll see dramatic improvement this year. My guess yes but at the same time behind the competition. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Meta Will Spend Record $60 Billion On AI This Year, Zuckerberg Says—After Trump Announces Stargate Deal With OpenAI

Meta will rapidly ramp up its spending in 2025 as part of its artificial intelligence push, according to its centibillionaire CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Friday, as the battle between Meta and its generative AI competitors including OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI comes to the forefront this week with President Donald Trump’s announcement of the $500 billion “Stargate” joint venture with OpenAI. Mark Zuckerberg, center, at Trump's inauguration. “This will be a defining year for AI,” Zuckerberg said on the company’s Threads social media site, continuing with updates and predictions for Meta’s AI push in 2025. Perhaps Zuckerberg’s biggest revelation Friday was his guidance for $60 billion to $65 billion in capital expenditures for Meta in 2025. That’s well above consensus analyst forecasts of $51 billion in capital expenditures this year, according to FactSet, and Zuckerberg’s median projected capex of $62.5 billion would be 63% above Meta’s $38.4 billion in projected 2024 capex and 129% above its $27.3 billion in 2023 capex. Meta will expand its “AI teams significantly” as part of its increased spending, declared Zuckerberg. The billionaire also predicted Meta’s Llama 4 large-language model “will become the leading state of the art” AI model and it will end 2025 with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, the highly coveted Nvidia-designed processors powering generative AI programs including Meta AI, xAI’s Grok and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. After initially declining about 1% premarket following Zuckerberg’s announcement, shares of Meta rallied Friday, advancing as much as 1.6% shortly after market open before settling into a 0.9% gain by midmorning. Meta stock scored a record intraday share price of $646.90 and all-time high market value of more than $1.6 trillion. Meta shares are up more than 8% year-to-date. Zuckerberg’s 2025 outlook comes during a whirlwind week for generative AI after Trump capped his first full day in office announcing a $500 billion joint venture designed to build out the data center infrastructure to power OpenAI’s technology. Stargate was considered a win for OpenAI in its battle against the likes of xAI, Meta and Amazon-backed Anthropic to build out the best artificial general intelligence model, and the project highlighted a very public feud between Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman as Trump’s close ally Musk apparently undercut the president. Meta’s push beyond social media dates back to its 2021 name change from Facebook to Meta. Wall Street initially revolted at the company’s billions of dollars in advanced tech research, as Meta stock crashed 64% in 2022, before improving financial performance and a broader investor rush into all things AI bolstered the stock’s turnaround. Since Trump won a second term in November, Zuckerberg has overseen a major culture shift at his company, ending its fact checking and diversity, equity and exclusion (DEI) programs as Zuckerberg decried the company’s culture as losing its “masculine energy.” Meta remains an advertising company on paper, with 98% of revenue in its most recent quarter coming from social media ads. Zuckerberg is the fourth-richest person in the world with a $222 billion net worth, trailing only fellow American technology moguls in Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Amazon chairman Jeff Bezos and Oracle chairman Larry Ellison. Zuckerberg owns about 13% of Meta, a stake worth about $200 billion. Meta will report financial results from 2024’s fourth quarter Wednesday afternoon. Consensus estimates call for $6.75 earnings per share and $47 billion in revenue, which would both be quarterly records. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

The Facebook and Instagram boss reveals plans to build a data center that is nearly as big as Manhattan to fuel its AI growth Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Friday said his company will spend $60-$65 billion this year as it looks to “significantly” expand its artificial intelligence team and services. The investment comes as Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is battling tech stalwarts like Google and Microsoft and upstart powerhouses like OpenAI for an upper hand in the budding AI industry. Most of Meta’s investment will go towards data centers — including one so big it would cover a large chunk of Manhattan — to fuel products like Llama, the AI model powering the company’s AI. He did not mention where that data center will be. “This will be a defining year for AI,” Zuckerberg said in a post on Facebook. “I expect Meta AI will be the leading assistant serving more than 1 billion people, Llama 4 will become the leading state of the art model, and we’ll build an AI engineer that will start contributing increasing amounts of code to our research and development efforts.” He added that this “massive effort” will “bring online approximately 1 [gigawatt] of compute in ’25 and we’ll end the year with more than 1.3 million [graphic processing units].” The $60-$65 billion in capital expenditures is a major increase from 2024, when the company spent about $40 billion. Meta’s investors did not seem upset by the AI investment, at least initially, with the company’s stock price increasing 0.7% in early Friday morning trading. The company is worth $1.62 trillion. Friday’s announcement comes after Zuckerberg joined a number of other tech CEOs, including OpenAI chief Sam Altman and Tesla boss Elon Musk, at President Donald Trump’s inauguration on Monday. Zuckerberg, in his Facebook post, said AI will be a central facet of Meta’s business moving forward. “Over the coming years, [AI] will drive our core products and business, unlock historic innovation and extend American technology leadership,” he wrote, before adding “Let’s go build!” and a flexing arm emoji.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / JANUARY 24 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more.

Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas.

Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations.

It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis.
