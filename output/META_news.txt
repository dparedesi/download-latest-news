Title: Trump says Mark Zuckerberg showed him a ‘Manhattan-sized’ AI data center

President Donald Trump gave a surprise shout-out to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg after his address at the World Economic Forum meeting Wednesday. At a Q&A after the address, Trump recounted a moment when Zuckerberg displayed a map of a proposed AI data center facility overlaid against Manhattan. The project’s footprint, Trump noted, appeared to swallow the entire island. “Mark Zuckerberg showed me a plant where he put it over a map of Manhattan, and it was basically the size of Manhattan,” Trump told the crowd of global elites. “I said, ‘You’ve got to be kidding.’ It was miles long, miles wide, and very high. It literally covered most of the island.”Meta’s stock jumped 1.6% after Trump’s statement, paring gains to 0.9% as of press time. While Trump referred to the project as a “big plant,” he could have been referring to Meta’s Richland Parish “Hyperion” AI data center campus, which is currently underway in Louisiana and is set to open in 2030. The massive industrial undertaking comprises 2,250 acres—a landmass equal to roughly 1,700 football fields; the campus will house 4 million square feet of data center space, making it one of the largest silicon clusters on earth. However, that 4 million square feet is much smaller than Manhattan’s 22 square miles; raising questions about whether Trump was referring to a much larger project being built by Zuckerberg. Trump also marveled at the project’s $50 billion price tag, contrasting the staggering investment with traditional real estate, harkening back to his past life as a developer. That $50 billion matches the projected cost of building the Hyperion data center campus.“If you spend $500 million, you can build a good shopping center,” Trump remarked. “But how do you spend $50 billion? When I looked at this thing, I understood why.” Meta is currently transitioning from a social media company to an AI infrastructure giant, raising its capital expenditure guidance for the 2025 fiscal year to nearly $72 billion, 70% more than the previous year. Looking into 2026, Zuckerberg has warned of “notably larger” spending, with market analysts projecting that annual outlays could surpass $100 billion. The president said that AI is “massive” and driving a rapid demand for energy that requires a shift in policy. Recognizing that the aging U.S. electrical grid cannot support the two-to-five gigawatts of power that these “titan clusters” require, Trump ordered the government to step aside during his speech: He told the Davos audience that he has authorized AI companies to act as their own private utilities. So far it seems that under this new framework, tech giants will build their own on-site power plants using natural gas, coal, or oil. Trump promised to slash the bureaucratic red tape that usually bogs down such projects, making them drag on for four or five years. Instead, he pledged to deliver federal approvals for these private energy plants in just two weeks, as long as the companies build their “own electric generating plants.” “You people are brilliant. You have a lot of money,” Trump said, addressing the tech executives in the room, egging them on to start building their own plants. This industrial blitz serves as the president’s primary leverage ahead of his planned state visit to China in April. Trump has argued that American leadership in AI depends on physical infrastructure rather than just software, and said Chinese President Xi Jinping respects this rapid industrial execution. “I’ve always had a very good relationship with President Xi,” Trump said. “But we’re leading the world in AI by a lot because I’ve allowed these big companies to build their own electric capacity. We’re creating more energy than any country anywhere in the world.” China and the U.S. are widely seen to be neck and neck in the AI race, with each country emphasizing their own strengths to best the other. The U.S. leads China in AI talent, investment, and access to semiconductors, while China has the U.S. beat on AI-related infrastructure, according to a recent Morgan Stanley report. China is just “months” behind the U.S. in terms of model quality, Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, told CNBC. The same day Trump was speaking at Davos, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismissed fears of an AI bubble while discussing China’s progress. The release of DeepSeek in 2023, in particular, he highlighted as a “major breakthrough.” Huang called China’s advance in this regard “a huge event for most of the industries, most of the companies around the world, because it’s the world’s first open reasoning model.” Since then, he explained, many open reasoning models have emerged, enabling researchers to create something that’s domain specific or specialized for their needs. In the U.S., Mark Zuckerberg has stood out for his own commitment to open-source AI, citing DeepSeek as a model.

January 21, 2026 09:09 ET | Source: Equity Insider Equity Insider VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Jan. 21, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Equity Insider - News Commentary – The North American nuclear landscape has shifted from planning to rapid execution, sparked by a $2.7 billion U.S. Department of Energy commitment to onshore uranium enrichment[1]. This massive structural realignment was further bolstered by an $800 million federal award to accelerate the deployment of small modular reactors[2], moving the industry beyond policy talk and into direct capital deployment. As the market re-rates the entire fuel cycle, several key platforms are emerging as leaders in domestic energy security, including Eagle Energy Metals (OTC: SVIIF) (Soon-to-be under symbol ‘NUCLR’), Centrus Energy (NYSE: LEU), NuScale Power Corporation (NYSE: SMR), Energy Fuels Inc. (NYSE-A: UUUU) (TSX: EFR), and Canada Nickel Company (TSXV: CNC) (OTCQB: CNIKF). Global investment in nuclear capacity is projected to triple by 2035, reaching approximately $210 billion as nations race toward ambitious 2050 power targets[3]. This secular transition is fueled by a new federal mandate that treats domestic critical minerals—from uranium to nickel—as vital national infrastructure[4]. In this unified industrial push, companies with execution-ready projects are being positioned to command the essential backbone of Western energy sovereignty. Eagle Energy Metals (OTC: SVIIF) (Soon-to-be under symbol ‘NUCLR’) announced this week that it has engaged BBA USA Inc., a consulting firm with over 45 years of energy sector experience, to design a targeted drilling campaign at its Aurora Uranium Project in support of an eventual Pre-Feasibility Study. The timing matters because the company is soon heading toward a NASDAQ listing under the ticker symbol NUCL through a business combination with Spring Valley Acquisition Corp. II (OTC: SVIIF), the same SPAC team that brought NuScale Power Corporation (NYSE: SMR) public in 2022. Eagle Energy holds rights to what it describes as the largest open pit-constrained, measured and indicated uranium deposit in the United States. The Aurora deposit sits on the Oregon-Nevada border with 32.75 million pounds of indicated uranium and 4.98 million pounds inferred, based on over 500 drill holes. Adjacent to Aurora is the Cordex deposit, which has seen over 100 holes drilled and offers potential resource expansion as the company digitizes existing data. "We're seeing sustained demand for nuclear power translate into real demand for uranium, particularly for projects located in the U.S.," said Mark Mukhija, CEO of Eagle Energy Metals. "Advancing Aurora with BBA is about making sure this asset is ready to meet that demand as the market continues to tighten." The domestic supply situation provides context for the company's positioning. In 2023, U.S. utilities purchased more than 50 million pounds of uranium, with less than 5% obtained from limited domestic production and over 95% sourced from abroad, including significant amounts from Russia and Kazakhstan. President Trump recently signed four executive orders aimed at removing regulatory barriers and quadrupling U.S. nuclear power over the next 25 years, while invoking the Defense Production Act to secure domestic uranium supply. Meanwhile, electricity demand is accelerating as AI, quantum computing, and cryptocurrency operations strain global grids. Meta recently announced plans to build a $10 billion AI data center in Louisiana powered by nuclear energy from Constellation Energy, while Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle, and Nvidia have struck major deals to power their operations with nuclear. Beyond uranium, Eagle Energy Metals also holds proprietary Small Modular Reactor (SMR) technology. With BBA's technical continuity (they authored Aurora's SK-1300 Technical Report Summary in August 2025), existing infrastructure, and access to low-cost hydropower in a mining-friendly jurisdiction, the company is advancing its asset as domestic uranium supply becomes increasingly prioritized. Centrus Energy (NYSE: LEU) was awarded $900 million by the U.S. Department of Energy to expand its uranium enrichment facility in Piketon, Ohio, to include commercial-scale production of High-Assay, Low-Enriched Uranium. The competitively-awarded federal funding will support Centrus' previously announced multi-billion dollar expansion that will also include additional Low-Enriched Uranium production to serve commercial utilities and the existing reactor fleet, with the project expected to support 1,000 construction jobs and 300 new operating jobs in Ohio while retaining 150 existing positions. "This award represents a historic commitment to revitalizing America's nuclear fuel supply chain and reclaiming American nuclear leadership on the global stage," said Amir Vexler, President and CEO of Centrus Energy. "I am grateful to the Trump Administration for making this commitment and to Republicans and Democrats in Congress who came together to provide this urgently needed funding." The fixed-price base task order amount is $900 million to bring new enrichment capacity online, with additional options for up to $170 million to produce and deliver HALEU to the Department. Centrus has already launched domestic centrifuge manufacturing at its Oak Ridge, Tennessee factory, with first new capacity expected online in 2029. NuScale Power Corporation (NYSE: SMR) has released study results demonstrating that pairing its advanced small modular reactor nuclear technology with a heat augmentation system can provide both profitable and reliable power for commercial chemical plants. The techno-economic assessment conducted in collaboration with Oak Ridge National Laboratory examined the performance of coupling a NuScale Power Module with a U.S. chemical facility to provide nuclear-generated steam and electric power. "As the first and only SMR to have our designs certified by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), NuScale continues to lead in the development of new technologies to provide process heat and electricity," said Dr. José Reyes, Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at NuScale Power. "As we saw in the results of this assessment, delivering high-temperature steam with NuScale's scalable architecture provides industrial users with unparalleled flexibility that can be integrated into their processes and offers a promising new path for them to explore. We are proud of the collaboration with our partners at ORNL and grateful for the support of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under the Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear (GAIN) initiative for this study." The study demonstrated that the NuScale integrated energy system could meet chemical plant requirements of 1.3 million kg/h of process steam at 400°C and 4.1 MPa while also providing 73 MW of electric power. The hybrid system's scalable architecture offers maximum flexibility for optimizing plant energy use and profitability across various configurations. Energy Fuels Inc. (NYSE-A: UUUU) (TSX: EFR) exceeded FY-2025 guidance for finished uranium production, mined uranium ore production and uranium concentrate sales. The company's Pinyon Plain Mine in Arizona and La Sal Complex in Utah produced over 1.6 million pounds of uranium in 2025, exceeding the top end of guidance by approximately 11%, while the White Mesa Mill produced more than one million pounds of finished U₃O₈ during 2025 with over 350,000 pounds produced in December alone. "These 2025 uranium metrics reinforce our reputation as, not only the country's lowest-cost and largest uranium producer, but as a company that delivers on its promises," said Mark S. Chalmers, CEO of Energy Fuels Inc. "Nuclear energy powered by uranium is among the cleanest, least expensive, and most reliable ways to supply our nation's growing energy and electricity needs." The company expects to sell 360,000 pounds of U₃O₈ in Q4-2025 at a weighted average sales price of approximately $74.93 per pound, representing 50% growth over Q3-2025 sales volumes. Energy Fuels Inc. completed two new long-term uranium sales contracts with U.S. nuclear power generating companies adding deliveries for 2027 to 2032 utilizing hybrid pricing with exposure to uranium market upside. Canada Nickel Company (TSXV: CNC) (OTCQB: CNIKF) was named as the second project to be advanced under Ontario's new One Project, One Process framework, reflecting the advanced state, scale, and strategic importance of the Crawford Nickel Project within Ontario's Critical Minerals Strategy. The 1P1P framework is designed to better coordinate Ontario's permitting and review processes for major mining developments by aligning timelines, responsibilities, and information sharing across provincial ministries. "Ontario is moving at lightning speed to open this 100% Canadian owned mine to create 4,000 jobs for Canadian workers," said Stephen Lecce, Minister of Energy and Mines. "In 2026, our government is going full-tilt to unlock one of the world's largest nickel deposits that will supercharge our economy and help end China's critical mineral dominance." Crawford is expected to be the largest nickel sulphide project in the western world and among the most economically significant mining developments in Canada, with independent analysis estimating the Project will generate more than $70 billion in GDP over its initial 40+ year mine life. Canada Nickel Company is targeting construction commencement by year-end 2026.

It's been one year since President Donald Trump was sworn back into office — and four of the wealthiest tech billionaires who attended or donated to his inauguration have gotten richer. Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, and Jensen Huang — all of whom are featured on Bloomberg's list of 500 wealthiest people in the world — were among the tech royalty who signaled support for the administration, either through attendance or a donation. Others included Tim Cook, Sam Altman, Sundar Pichai, Satya Nadella, and Shou Zi Chew. The tech billionaire with the largest increase in his net worth during Trump's first year is also the one who was closest to the Trump administration: Elon Musk. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, the Tesla CEO's wealth increased by 52% over the past year. While Musk, Zuckerberg, Bezos, and Huang are all wealthier today than they were on Inauguration Day in 2025, there have been some ups and downs. Collectively, the group lost $194 billion in wealth during Trump's first 100 days as markets reacted to the administration's tariffs. They've since made up for those losses and then some. As of January 19, the group was cumulatively $288 billion wealthier than a year prior. Here's where all four stood as of Monday, January 19, 2026.

Net worth January 19, 2025: $449 billion Net worth January 19, 2026: $681 billion Percent change: +52% After spending at least $277 million backing Trump and Republicans during the 2024 election, Musk attended the inauguration and worked closely with the White House as the public face of the White House DOGE Office. Following his departure in May, Musk and Trump had a very public falling out, though they later reconciled. Musk's work with DOGE resulted in backlash against Tesla, with the company's share price declining in the first few months of Trump's presidency. It has since recovered, and in the year since Trump was elected Musk has solidified his standing as the world's richest man. In November, Tesla shareholders approved a $1 trillion-dollar pay package for the Tesla CEO, if he hits a series of goals, and there are plans for a SpaceX IPO in 2026. Net worth January 19, 2025: $245 billion Net worth January 19, 2026: $261 billion Percent change: +7% Bezos's wealth, most of which is tied to Amazon stock, has increased since Trump took office a second time. Bezos, the Amazon founder and chairman, attended the inauguration alongside his now-wife Lauren Sánchez. Amazon also donated $1 million to the president's inaugural committee. Analysts have said that Amazon was especially at risk of being negatively impacted by Trump's trade war, and CEO Andy Jassy said this week prices on the platform are increasing as a result of tariffs. Amazon's share price is roughly the same as it was a year ago. Net worth January 19, 2025: $217 billion Net worth January 19, 2026: $220 billion Percent change: +1% Zuckerberg and Trump once had a contentious relationship that went back several years prior to the 2024 election, with the latter at one time threatening to have the Meta CEO jailed over Facebook banning Trump's account in the wake of the January 6 Capitol riot. Zuckerberg publicly warmed to Trump during the 2024 cycle, offering him praise and attending the inauguration. Zuckerberg was seated next to Trump at a White House dinner attended by tech leaders last year. Meta also donated $1 million to the inaugural committee. Net worth January 19, 2025: $117 billion Net worth January 19, 2026: $154 billion Percent change: +32% Huang did not attend the inauguration, but Nvidia donated $1 million to the inaugural committee. The Nvidia CEO also met with Trump shortly after he took office and the company has worked with the White House on AI policy. Jump to

Update font size. Reset Apple could be on the verge of its most transformative iPhone release in years. According to a new note from Citi analyst Atif Malik, the tech giant is poised to launch its first foldable iPhone later in 2026 — likely debuting alongside the iPhone 18 Pro and Pro Max models at Apple’s annual fall event — with shipments ramping up quickly thereafter. Priced at a premium of around $2,000, the device is expected to see limited initial volume of approximately 8 million units in 2026 (roughly 3% of total iPhone shipments), before accelerating to 20 million units in 2027. Brian Sozzi for Yahoo Finance: ‎ The analyst reiterated a Buy rating on Apple — about 50% of Wall Street analysts rate Apple a Buy, Yahoo Finance data shows. He did cut his price target to $315 from $330, citing margin risk from the surge in memory chip prices. Shares of Apple have lagged the S&P 500 over the past year, gaining 11% compared to a 15% advance for the S&P 500. The stock isn’t faring any better to kick off 2026, either — shares are down 6%, tying with Meta (META) for the worst-performing member of the Magnificent Seven. But Apple may be poised to improve the narrative on the stock. For one, Apple just inked an important deal with Google, where Google’s Gemini models and cloud technology will power the next generation of the smartphone maker’s AI for Siri. While some experts say the deal is an admission that Apple is well behind in the AI race, others would counter at least Apple is now in the game. Secondarily, a long-rumored foldable iPhone would create a fresh reason for people to finally upgrade from prior iPhone iterations. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: Apple won’t be able to make enough foldable iPhones to satisfy demand well into 2027. As BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote in a recent note to clients, “Upcoming catalysts include launch of a foldable iPhone in the fall and the launch of an enhanced Siri with integration with Gemini AI which can drive higher upgrades.” ‎ Please help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.

Title: Powering 2026: The Strategic Shift to Domestic Uranium Security

January 20, 2026 13:11 ET | Source: USA News Group USA News Group VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Jan. 20, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- USANewsGroup.com News Commentary – As we enter 2026, the global uranium sector appears to be hitting a considerable supply wall[1]. With U.S. domestic production languishing at 90% below annual requirements[2], the push for North American fuel independence seems to have shifted from a political goal to a critical market priority. This structural supply-demand mismatch comes at a time when activity in the sector is picking up and positioning several key players as potentially essential infrastructure platforms, including Spring Valley Acquisition Corp. II (OTC: SVIIF), NexGen Energy (NYSE: NXE) (TSX: NXE), Gladiator Metals (TSXV: GLAD) (OTCQB: GDTRF), Premier American Uranium (TSXV: PUR) (OTCQB: PAUIF), and Uranium Energy Corp. (NYSE-A: UEC). The primary catalyst is a significant increase in digital power; data center capacity is projected to triple by 2030 as AI workloads redefine the global grid[3]. Consequently, the Western world appears locked in a strategic race to secure domestic critical minerals[4], moving past simple exploration and into the high-stakes build-out of uranium and copper supplies in jurisdictions that prioritize geopolitical security. Spring Valley Acquisition Corp. II (OTC: SVIIF), a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) recently announced a pending merger with uranium miner Eagle Energy Metals, a next-generation nuclear energy company with the largest mineable, measured and indicted U.S. uranium deposit. Following the announcement, Eagle Energy Metals announced that it has engaged BBA USA Inc., a consulting firm with over 45 years of energy sector experience, to design a targeted drilling campaign at its Aurora Uranium Project in support of an eventual Pre-Feasibility Study. The timing matters because following the SPAC merger, the company is heading toward a NASDAQ listing, subject to customary closing conditions, under the ticker symbol NUCL. Notably, the team orchestrating this transaction is the same SPAC team that brought NuScale Power Corporation (NYSE: SMR) public in 2022. Eagle Energy Metals holds rights to what it describes as the largest open pit-constrained, measured and indicated uranium deposit in the United States. The Aurora deposit sits on the Oregon-Nevada border with 32.75 million pounds of indicated uranium and 4.98 million pounds inferred, based on over 500 drill holes. Adjacent to Aurora is the Cordex deposit, which has seen over 100 holes drilled and offers potential resource expansion as the company digitizes existing data. "We're seeing sustained demand for nuclear power translate into real demand for uranium, particularly for projects located in the U.S.," said Mark Mukhija, CEO of Eagle Energy Metals. "Advancing Aurora with BBA is about making sure this asset is ready to meet that demand as the market continues to tighten." The domestic supply situation provides context for the company's positioning. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, in 2023, U.S. utilities purchased more than 50 million pounds of uranium, with less than 5% obtained from limited domestic production and over 95% sourced from abroad, including significant amounts from Russia and Kazakhstan. President Trump recently signed four executive orders aimed at removing regulatory barriers and seeking to quadruple U.S. nuclear power over the next 25 years, while invoking the Defense Production Act to secure domestic uranium supply. Meanwhile, electricity demand is accelerating as AI, quantum computing, and cryptocurrency operations strain global grids. Meta recently announced plans to build a $10 billion AI data center in Louisiana powered by nuclear energy from Constellation Energy, while Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle, and Nvidia have struck major deals to power their operations with nuclear. Beyond uranium, Eagle Energy Metals also holds rights to exclusive Small Modular Reactor (SMR) technology. With BBA's technical continuity (they authored Aurora's SK-1300 Technical Report Summary in August 2025), existing infrastructure, and access to low-cost hydropower in a mining-friendly jurisdiction, the company is advancing its asset as domestic uranium supply becomes increasingly prioritized. NexGen Energy (NYSE: NXE) (TSX: NXE) announced its highest-grade assay results to date at the 100%-owned Patterson Corridor East (PCE) with drill hole RK-25-256 returning 5.5 meters at 21.4% U₃O₈ between 590.0 and 595.5 meter depth, including 2.5 meters at 46.1% U₃O₈ and 0.5 meters at 74.8% U₃O₈. The high-grade uranium intersection is reportedly 119 meters down-dip of drill hole RK-25-232 and an additional 51 meters down-dip of recently reported RK-25-254, with intense high-grade uranium mineralization currently interpreted along a minimum of 215 meters of dip extent. "RK-25-256 high-grade assay results, consisting of ultra-high grade 0.5 m 74.8% U₃O₈ takes PCE into a rare mineralized category on a world scale for uranium deposits," said Leigh Curyer, Founder and CEO of NexGen Energy. "This type of basement-hosted mineralization is synonymous with Arrow, only 3.5 km to the west." NexGen indicated that it is developing a uranium project portfolio focused on multi-generational nuclear fuel supply, with Arrow as the inaugural deposit. The company controls the most prospective portfolio of over 190,000 hectares across 140 kilometers of the southwest Athabasca Basin in Saskatchewan, Canada. Gladiator Metals (TSXV: GLAD) (OTCQB: GDTRF) announced a significant new discovery at its Whitehorse Copper Belt property in Yukon, with maiden drilling at Cub East intersecting 27 meters of 2.56% copper and 1.44 grams per tonne gold within 44.2 meters of 1.69% copper and 0.93 g/t gold. The five-hole program confirmed high-grade copper-gold-magnetite skarn mineralization over 300 meters of strike length, with all holes intersecting significant grades adjacent to the historic Black Cub South pit. "Gladiator's maiden drilling campaign on the newly identified geophysical target at Cub East has delivered exceptional high-grade results and a major new discovery, fully validating the company's innovative exploration strategy," said Jason Bontempo, CEO of Gladiator Metals. "All five drillholes intersected previously unknown zones of high-grade copper-gold-magnetite skarn, confirming robust continuity across more than 350 meters of strike and 300 meters down-dip." The discovery was identified through combined gravity and Induced Polarization surveys beneath shallow cover, with mineralization remaining open in all directions. Gladiator Metals says it is fully funded to execute over 50,000 meters of additional diamond drilling in 2026 targeting high-grade copper skarns throughout the Whitehorse Copper Belt. Premier American Uranium (TSXV: PUR) (OTCQB: PAUIF) announced that it filed a technical report containing its Preliminary Economic Assessment and updated Mineral Resource Estimate for the Cebolleta Uranium Project in New Mexico, outlining the potential for a low-CAPEX, long-life uranium operation with strong baseline economics. The company indicated that the PEA demonstrates an after-tax net present value of US$83.9 million at an 8% discount rate, with average annual production of approximately 1.4 million pounds U₃O₈ over a 13-year mine life and total production of 18.1 million pounds. According to the company, the project features direct capital expenditures of US$64.2 million and average operating costs of US$41.60 per pound U₃O₈ recovered, with heap leach processing costs of US$16.72 per short ton. The updated Mineral Resource Estimate includes indicated resources of 20.3 million pounds eU₃O₈ grading 0.12%, representing a 9% increase compared to the 2024 technical report, with significant upside potential through improved metallurgical recoveries that could increase the base case after-tax NPV by approximately 90% to US$159 million at 90% recovery assumptions. Uranium Energy Corp. (NYSE-A: UEC) reported results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026, achieving a Total Cost per Pound of $34.35 based on production of 68,612 pounds of precipitated uranium and dried and drummed U₃O₈ for the quarter. The company announced that it completed major construction milestones at Burke Hollow setting the stage for initial operations at South Texas's newest in-situ recovery production facility, while advancing six additional header houses at Christensen Ranch in Wyoming's Powder River Basin and completing a full refurbishment of the yellowcake thickener and calciner at the Irigaray Central Processing Plant. "This quarter represented a step change for UEC," said Amir Adnani, President and CEO of Uranium Energy. "With the launch of United States Uranium Refining & Conversion Corp, we added a new business line that positions the Company to become the only U.S. supplier with both uranium and UF₆ production capabilities." Uranium Energy has stated that it maintains a strong balance sheet with $698 million of cash, uranium inventory and equities at market prices with no debt, and holds 1,356,000 pounds of U₃O₈ in inventory. The company's workforce has grown to 84 personnel in Wyoming and 86 in South Texas supporting expanding operations.

European shares were hit by the continuing uncertainty caused by Us president Donald Trump’s tariff threats over his desire to “acquire” Greenland. The tensions have dented sentiment amid a positive start to the year, with investors believing Europe is vulnerable to higher tariffs, but that ⁠defence and infrastructure spending could soften the blow on the markets. The Iseq All-Share index underperformed against regional comparators on Tuesday, falling 0.89 per cent to 12,872.65. Insurance group FBD Holdings Plc topped the index, gaining 2.51 per cent to reach €16.35. That positive movement was not enough to keep the index out of the red, as a series of major components fell. In the news, Ryanair fell 1.18 per cent to €28.49 amid an ongoing saga between chief executive Michael O’Leary and Tesla owner Elon Musk. Mr Musk held a poll on whether he should purchase the company and oust its chief executive. Insulation and building materials specialist Kingspan Group dropped 2.05 per cent to a share price of €69.35. The company was joined in the red by bankers AIB and Bank of Ireland, which each fell 0.69 per cent on the day. The UK’s FTSE 100 logged its steepest one-day fall in close to ‍two weeks on Tuesday amid rising trade uncertainty. The blue-chip index closed down 0.72 per cent. In ⁠London, pharmaceutical stocks fell 1.6 per cent. AstraZeneca fell 2.6 per cent, after the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker said it would delist its American Depositary Shares and debt securities from Nasdaq. Conversely, precious metals miners rose 1.8 per cent, as gold vaulted past $4,700 an ounce for the first time, while silver hovered near record highs as Trump’s tariff threats sparked a flight to safe-haven assets. Miners have been among the biggest drivers of the FTSE 100’s positive start to 2026, driving it to record highs. European shares touched their lowest in nearly two weeks on Tuesday, as mounting unease over Mr Trump’s tariffs threat ‍over Greenland hurt optimism from earlier in the month. The pan-European STOXX 600 ended 0.7 per cent lower, marking its biggest two-day drop in two months. While some remain sceptical about the extent to which Mr Trump will follow through on his threats, investors ‌are ​on ‍edge as the US president has shown little sign of softening his rhetoric. In company news, French automaker Renault Group’s shares rose 2.2 per cent after it said sales volumes had risen 3.2 per cent in 2025. Oil major TotalEnergies was up 1.4 per cent, as the company said it expects lower oil and liquefied natural gas sales in the fourth quarter of 2025, but stronger margins on refining fuels. Britain’s Wise jumped 16 per cent on robust third-quarter results, while Qiagen gained 12.4 per cent after a report said it is considering strategic options ‌amid fresh interest. Luxury group LVMH shares fell 2.2 per cent. Mr Trump threatened to slap a 200 per cent ‌tariff on French wines and champagne to push French president Emmanuel Macron to join his Board of Peace initiative. Wall Street’s main indexes started the holiday-truncated week on ‍a dour note as investors were spooked by the Greenland-related tariff threats from Mr Trump against Europe. The Nasdaq broke below its 50-day moving average – an important technical threshold – while the S&P 500 hovered at the edge. Critical Metals, which has a ⁠strategic presence in Greenland, slipped 2.7 per cent. Earnings season is also kicking into a higher gear, with several industry bellwethers set to report their quarterly earnings this week. Netflix gained 0.6 per cent after switching to an all-cash offer for Warner Bros Discovery’s studio and streaming assets, without increasing the $82.7 billion bid. The streaming giant, due to report its quarterly ‌earnings after the bell, was the only ‌stock in the mega-cap FAANG group of tech stocks – Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google – to trade in the green. Industrial bellwether 3M tumbled 8.5 per cent after forecasting annual adjusted profit a touch below Wall Street expectations, while Fastenal fell 3.8 per cent after missing fourth-quarter revenue estimates. – Additional reporting Reuters From maternity leave to remote working: Submit your work-related questions here Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: 8 signs the AI bubble may pop in 2026
URL: https://www.pcworld.com/article/3026273/signs-the-ai-bubble-may-pop-in-2026.html
Time Published: 2026-01-20T14:00:00Z

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. The AI industry is ridiculous. All you need is a cursory glance to spot utterly bonkers valuations, bizarre circular funding models, and a dearth of viable products and profitability. You don’t need to be an expert to know there’s something off about an industry built around companies promising to spend trillions while barely making billions. I have no insider information, crystal ball, horoscope, or deep AI-powered analytics of the industry to back up my idea that the AI bubble will burst in 2026. But the signs are all there and it seems awfully likely. Here are just a few of the many red flags. Major tech companies like Nvidia, Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Oracle have all seen their stock prices explode over the past few years as they’ve consolidated their AI efforts, pulled in gargantuan amounts of funding based on AI hype, and announced incredible infrastructure projects that have upset almost every industry, from smartphone production to water management. Nvidia They, in turn, are funding a few select data companies. (How do you think companies like ScaleAI grew so big, so fast?) But as for everyone else, they’re not doing so good. Indeed, if it weren’t for the big tech companies, the US economy would almost certainly be in a recession right now, according to Deutsche Bank research. That might be OK if these companies were developing something genuinely innovative, profitable, and/or showing real potential to deliver on their investments. But the biggest reason for their sky-high valuations is simple: they’re all just investing in each other. When Oracle announced its $300 billion Stargate Project with OpenAI, Nvidia was set to be the major hardware supplier. Nvidia also invested $100 billion of its own in OpenAI, and Nvidia is also a major investor in CoreWeave (another Oracle supplier). CoreWeave works closely with Microsoft, which is itself a major OpenAI investor. Microsoft and Nvidia have also invested in OpenAI rival Anthropic, which has done major infrastructure deals with Amazon and Google. The list goes on. And while these enormous investments might have sent company valuations skyward, many of them are based on multi-year plans with estimates for future hardware delivery and assumptions around costs and scalability. For it all to succeed, it’s got to be done before whatever AI bubble there is bursts. In totality, these investments are completely unprecedented, too. By 2030, McKinsey estimates that AI investment could reach almost $7 trillion. For comparison, the entire Manhattan Project cost only $30 billion (adjusted for inflation). Yikes. Nvidia might be making a killing on AI as the seller of GPU-shaped shovels in this proverbial gold rush, but everyone else is struggling. Microsoft has revised AI sales targets due to poor uptake of its paid-for services, and OpenAI has churned through over $150 billion in investment dollars just to make $15 billion or so in revenue in 2025. If OpenAI can’t figure out how to turn a profit with the backing of all its AI friends, with close to a billion active users, and with the most dominant mindshare in the AI chatbot space, who else will? For institutionalized tech companies like Google, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft—the ones with diversified businesses, long-tail revenue options, and expansive cash stockpiles—this may not be a problem in the short or medium terms. But even major companies can’t burn through money forever. Microsoft and many others have enacted huge layoffs over the past year to help maintain healthier balance sheets, and investors are going to come calling for their returns sooner or later. Smaller AI companies will be affected first, but as we saw with Meta’s disastrously unprofitable endeavors to develop the Metaverse, even massive tech companies can run dry on interest and momentum. What happens then to the trillions in AI investment? From Nvidia’s DGI Spark system to home hackers running large language models on their gaming GPUs, it’s easier than ever to run local AI on your own machine. They aren’t the top models with their trillions of parameters, mind you, but the latest large language models designed for home hardware are becoming increasingly capable. Mark Hachman / IDG OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, and others would love a future where you run all your AI services through their cloud platforms that are gated with subscription fees, but the latest local LLMs are capable enough to handle basic text generation, editing, summarizing, and image generation. With the added benefits of improved privacy, security, and response time for local LLMs, more and more individuals and companies are going to pivot this way in the months and years to come. That’s not going to do any favors for AI companies seeking profitability. This one might be more of a meta point on economic bubbles than a specific point for the AI industry, but massive market rallies only tend to last a few years. Yahoo Finance highlights how the dot-com bubble lasted just over two years, the Japanese stock bubble of the 1980s lasted three years, and the big tech-disrupted rally after COVID just under a year. In each of these cases, their respective stock markets saw enormous growth of several hundred percent in just a few years. The AI boom hasn’t quite managed that—it has experienced a gain of around 130 percent over the past three years—but three years is already longer than most of these historic booms. If AI is a bubble that’s going to bust, then it’s almost past due going by historic trends. All the major AI companies have announced their deals and are starting to make them reality. We aren’t going to see new rounds of trillion-dollar deals from even the major tech firms, as even they have limits on the capital they have available to them. But scaling up to these grandiose goals of AI data centers all over the world is proving difficult. After buying up all the GPUs and memory they can, some of these companies are still struggling to bring them online. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in November that the company now had a power problem, meaning it had GPUs that couldn’t physically plug in because it lacked the power to run them. And then you have Elon Musk’s xAI trying to import a power station (no, really) and supersonic jet company Boom Supersonic converting its jet engines into gas generators (no, really!). AI needs power, but power is at a premium. Power stations and their associated grid infrastructures take years or even decades to build. When power supply fails to catch up to their ambitions, it’s going to slam the brakes on expansion. A slowdown like that is the last thing the AI industry needs to keep its hype train rolling. No one likes Grok’s deepfakes and child exploitation images. Fake frames in Nvidia-run games are making gamers feel like they’re not really playing their games. AI-driven memory shortages and associated price spikes for everyday tech products are driving people crazy. Dell Companies are noticing and already pivoting, too. The most stark example so far this year is Dell relaunching its XPS brand at CES 2026. Sure, it’s still a “Copilot+ PC,” but you’d never know it from the marketing. AI is gone from the forefront and back is the focus on longevity, everyday performance, and lightweight design—you know, the things that consumers actually care about. If no one’s even interested in buying AI, how are these companies ever going to make it profitable? That’s not something investors are going to want to see or hear this year. On top of all the internal AI industry factors that could bring about its fall, there’s also global instability that could just as likely to deal a death blow. The US administration’s volatile leadership keeps throwing up (and tearing down) trade barriers. Hardware nationalization and nationalism are driving secular investments rather than global branch-outs. TSMC And as the superpowers keep eyeing up what their neighbors have, there’s the risk of war stalling out the world economy. Just China closing off Taiwan’s access to global markets would be enough to collapse just about everything in the tech sphere. Hopefully nothing like that comes to pass, but the prospect of it is one more Sword of Damocles hanging over the AI industry. Google, Amazon, and Microsoft won’t collapse. OpenAI probably won’t collapse. But the AI hype train of today could be heavily derailed. The smaller and medium AI companies, and all the firms promising agentic revolutions for your business? They’ll be gone. Stock prices will collapse, and global recession could be the medium-term fallout that eventually corrects everything back to some semblance of normalcy. Long term, though, even the companies that remain will have to contend with hardware deprecation that’ll see them scurrying back to Nvidia every 2 to 3 years. Even with all that hardware power, none of these companies are going to reach AGI (or even super-intelligence) with large language models that can’t functionally understand anything. AI is here to stay, but the industry as it is can’t last much longer. The signs are there that 2026 could be the year it all changes—again.

Chips, models, hash rates, capital raises. That framing is already outdated. At this stage of the cycle, growth is no longer decided by demand or funding. It is decided by power. Not theoretical power. Not future contracts. Existing, usable electricity that can support a continuous load. That is the asset hyperscalers are quietly competing for, and it is where expansion is actually happening. Companies that already have access to it within live facilities can move. Those that do not are discovering that capital alone does not unlock growth. That framework is what makes Datacentrex (NASDAQ:DTCX) worth a closer look, because the company is not approaching this shift from the sidelines. It already operates across four U.S. colocation sites running continuous, power-intensive workloads, with uptime above 95%. Its current fleet of more than 3,100 wholly owned Scrypt mining rigs is live today, spread across diversified data-center load zones, and management has disclosed a funded expansion to more than 4,100 rigs in the first half of 2026. This is not a future buildout. The facilities are live, powered, and operating today, with revenue being generated under continuous load. Look at where the biggest buyers are actually adding load. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has concentrated new AI capacity inside existing campuses in places like Iowa and Texas, where power delivery and transmission are already settled. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has done the same in long-established regions such as Virginia and Ohio. These are not speculative locations. They are places where electricity shows up on time and at scale. Expansion is flowing to what already works, while projects tied to future power remain stuck. That is the environment in which Datacentrex operates. It is not waiting on approvals or interconnection. Its sites are already live. Power is flowing, load is running, and revenue is being generated under continuous operation. At this stage of the cycle, the question is not who wants to expand, but who already can. What matters next is how that position is used. Datacentrex is not holding power idle. Today, it is monetized through Scrypt mining. The infrastructure is already paid for, and cash is already coming in. At the same time, the company sits adjacent to a data center and AI market already measured in the hundreds of billions of dollars a year. Secured access to live power does not promise outcomes, but it determines who even gets a seat when demand shifts. For now, Datacentrex uses its contracted, energized capacity the way infrastructure businesses usually do: by putting it to work. Datacentrex’s current revenue engine is Scrypt mining, a faster-growing and less saturated corner of crypto infrastructure that has outperformed expectations over the past cycle. Scrypt mining secures networks such as Litecoin and Dogecoin using specialized hardware designed for steady, always-on operation. It is a different market from Bitcoin mining. The field is smaller. Competition is thinner. Scale is not dominated by a handful of megasites, and that helps shape returns. Over the past year, that gap has been visible in operating results. While Bitcoin miners have dealt with rising difficulty, higher capital intensity, and margin pressure following the halving, Scrypt economics have held up better. Company materials show that Scrypt mining delivered stronger realized profitability than SHA-256 mining for much of 2024. And it’s all because of the structure. A clearer way to gauge mining economics is to look at what the networks pay miners. CoinMetrics network data show that total miner revenue on Scrypt networks such as Dogecoin and Litecoin stayed comparatively steady through 2024. Bitcoin miner revenue did not. The halving cut payouts sharply, and margins across the SHA-256 ecosystem tightened. Scrypt mining also allows a single machine to earn rewards from two networks at the same time, most commonly Litecoin and Dogecoin. Power use does not increase, but output does. That feature is known as merged mining. For many operators, merged mining creates a secondary problem. Rewards arrive in more than one cryptocurrency, each with its own liquidity and conversion process. Turning production into usable cash can involve multiple steps, additional timing risk, and unnecessary friction. Datacentrex (NASDAQ:DTCX) handles this differently. Mining output is consolidated into bitcoin rather than managed across several smaller assets. The result is a simpler cash flow. Fewer conversions. Less exposure to liquidity bottlenecks. Revenue moves from production to cash without detours. That shows up in operating results. Datacentrex has disclosed that its Scrypt operations have been EBITDA positive from the start. Power costs are covered. Sites fund themselves. Expansion is incremental rather than speculative. Source: https://x.com/ElphaPex/status/2003624000581464457 This defines Scrypt's role in the business today. It is not framed as a destination. It is the current workload on energized sites. Cash is generated, infrastructure stays active, and the company retains the option to reallocate capacity over time. In a market where power is scarce, that combination matters. Treasury Strategy: Liquidity First Datacentrex pays attention to how revenue becomes usable capital, not just how it is produced. Scrypt mining generates value across multiple networks. As a result, many operators end up managing several different crypto assets. That complicates cash flow. Conversion timing matters. Liquidity varies. None of that improves mining performance, but it can affect outcomes. Datacentrex (NASDAQ:DTCX) avoids that problem by consolidating mining proceeds into a single settlement asset. Revenue is realized quickly and cleanly. There is no need to manage multiple small positions or wait for favorable conversion windows. The result is a liquid treasury because operating costs are covered without the need to sell. Capital can be held, deployed, or left idle depending on conditions. Decisions are not dictated by short-term price moves or balance-sheet pressure. That flexibility is the point. The treasury does not try to add returns on its own. It preserves the ability to act when opportunities appear and to sit still when they do not. Execution: Scale, Control, and Cash Discipline Execution at Datacentrex begins with ownership. The company owns its machines and operates directly within third-party colocation facilities directly. There are no leased rigs and no vendor liens embedded in the fleet. Decisions around uptime, expansion, and capital allocation stay simple because nothing lies between the company and its assets. Today, Datacentrex runs more than 3,100 Scrypt ASICs across four U.S. colocation sites. Power is delivered and consumed under continuous load. These facilities are operating now, and utilization is happening in real time. Growth builds from that base. Management has disclosed plans to expand the fleet beyond 4,100 rigs in the first half of 2026, adding capacity inside facilities that are already running. Power, cooling, and operating processes are in place. Capital goes toward machines, not construction. The economics are already visible. Datacentrex has said its Scrypt subsidiary, dogehash technologies’ operations have been EBITDA positive from inception. Power costs are covered. Sites carry themselves. Expansion follows cash flow. The company is also carrying cash. Datacentrex has disclosed roughly $45 million on hand, no long-term debt, and full ownership of its operating equipment. It is not forced to raise capital to keep operating or to add capacity. The people involved have been through cycles where that distinction mattered. Members of the board and management have built and run crypto and data infrastructure businesses during periods when power tightened and capital disappeared. They have seen where leverage breaks things first. That experience shows up in how the business is run. Assets are owned outright. Capacity is added where operations already work. Liquidity stays intact. The company is not built to chase scale just to justify fixed costs. Management has been explicit about how it sees the model evolving. Datacentrex (NASDAQ:DTCX) has pointed to companies such as IREN, Cipher Mining, and TeraWulf as examples of businesses where the market stopped valuing hash rate alone and started valuing who has secured access to power,, balance sheets, and operating flexibility. The asset is not the output. It is the infrastructure underneath it. For investors, execution here is straightforward. The system is operating, and cash is coming in, while capacity can be added without rebuilding the business. Capital, Revenue, and the Size of the Playing Field The scale of what is unfolding in data centers and AI infrastructure is already well defined. J.P. Morgan estimates that U.S. data center capacity could exceed 130 gigawatts by 2030, up from roughly 20–30 gigawatts today, with total infrastructure and hardware investment required to support that buildout running north of $3 trillion. Power, not demand, is the gating factor. Generation exists. Transmission, interconnection, and delivery do not move at the same speed. J.P. Morgan’s work shows where capacity already exists. U.S.-listed bitcoin miners are operating more than 8.5 gigawatts of energized power, with approvals in place for roughly another 8 gigawatts. These are not plans on paper. The sites are connected, permitted, and already drawing load. Moving from mining to higher value computing is expensive, but the most difficult step is already complete. Electricity is reaching the site. J.P. Morgan estimates that converting existing mining power capacity to HPC applications could cost roughly $10-15 million per megawatt before GPUs, with all-in AI data center costs exceeding $45 million per megawatt once hardware is included. That math explains why expansion across the sector is gravitating toward sites that already work, rather than projects that still need power. This is where Datacentrex fits in. The company is not trying to solve the power problem. It is operating after it. Its business decisions concern how to use existing capacity, not how to secure it. At this point in the cycle, outcomes hinge on where electricity is already being consumed. Other companies to keep a close eye on in the space: NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) NVIDIA is the dominant global supplier of GPUs and accelerated computing platforms that underpin artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, and modern data centers. Its data center segment has become the company’s primary growth engine, driven by demand for AI training and inference workloads from hyperscalers, sovereign cloud projects, and enterprise customers. NVIDIA’s strength lies not only in hardware, such as its H100 and upcoming Blackwell platforms, but also in its tightly integrated CUDA software ecosystem, networking solutions, and AI development tools. As power availability and infrastructure constraints become limiting factors for AI deployment, NVIDIA’s ability to deliver higher performance per watt further strengthens its competitive position across global data center buildouts. Nebius Group (NASDAQ:NBIS) Nebius Group is positioning itself as a next-generation AI infrastructure and cloud services provider, focused on large-scale GPU computing and AI-optimized data centers. The company caters to enterprises and AI developers seeking high-performance compute capacity outside traditional hyperscaler ecosystems. Nebius’ strategy reflects a broader shift toward diversified and sovereign AI infrastructure, where access to power, land, and advanced cooling solutions is becoming as critical as capital. As demand for AI workloads accelerates globally, Nebius stands to benefit from structural shortages in GPU-ready data center capacity, particularly in regions prioritizing localized AI compute. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) Micron is a leading producer of DRAM and NAND memory, supplying critical components for data centers, AI accelerators, and advanced computing systems. The rapid expansion of AI workloads has materially improved the company’s long-term outlook, particularly through rising demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM), which is essential for training large AI models. After navigating a cyclical downturn, Micron is benefiting from tightening supply conditions and improving pricing dynamics. Its continued investment in advanced memory technologies positions it as a key enabler of AI data center growth, where memory bandwidth and efficiency are increasingly decisive performance constraints. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) AMD has emerged as a major force in high-performance computing, with expanding exposure to data center CPUs, AI accelerators, and cloud infrastructure. Its EPYC server processors continue to gain traction among hyperscalers and enterprise customers seeking alternatives in mission-critical data center deployments. AMD is also scaling its Instinct GPU platform to compete in AI training and inference, particularly as customers seek supplier diversification amid surging AI demand. The company’s focus on performance-per-watt efficiency aligns well with growing power constraints in data centers, making AMD an increasingly relevant player in AI-driven infrastructure spending cycles. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple remains a global consumer technology leader, with a vertically integrated ecosystem spanning devices, custom silicon, software, and services. While Apple is not a direct competitor in hyperscale AI data centers, it is increasingly embedding AI capabilities into its products through on-device processing and energy-efficient chip design. Apple’s custom silicon strategy prioritizes performance within strict power and thermal limits, a philosophy that contrasts with brute-force data center AI models. As AI features become standard across consumer devices, Apple’s ability to deploy intelligence efficiently at scale strengthens its ecosystem while limiting dependence on external data center capacity. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon’s strategic importance increasingly rests on Amazon Web Services (AWS), the world’s largest cloud computing platform and a cornerstone of global AI and data center infrastructure. AWS continues to be a primary beneficiary of rising demand for AI training, inference, and enterprise cloud migration, driving large-scale investments in data centers, custom silicon, and energy procurement. Amazon’s in-house chips, including Trainium and Inferentia, reflect a growing effort to control costs and performance as power availability becomes a limiting factor in AI expansion. Beyond AI, AWS plays a central role in blockchain infrastructure, cybersecurity services, and cloud-native compliance, positioning Amazon as a critical enabler of next-generation digital and financial systems. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) Alphabet, through Google Cloud and its global network of hyperscale data centers, is one of the most technologically advanced AI infrastructure operators in the world. The company has long leveraged AI internally for search, advertising, and optimization, and is now commercializing those capabilities via cloud-based AI platforms and large language models. Google’s vertically integrated approach — combining custom TPUs, advanced cooling systems, and renewable energy sourcing — gives it a structural advantage as AI workloads strain global power grids. Alphabet is also a major player in cybersecurity through its cloud security offerings and acquisitions, and maintains indirect exposure to blockchain technologies through infrastructure services rather than speculative crypto activity. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) Meta is undergoing a fundamental transformation from a social media company into an AI-first platform operator, supported by one of the largest privately owned data center footprints in the world. The company is investing aggressively in AI infrastructure to power content recommendation, advertising optimization, and generative AI applications across its ecosystem. Meta’s data center strategy increasingly emphasizes custom silicon, high-density computing, and energy efficiency, reflecting the growing importance of power access and cooling in AI scalability. While Meta has pulled back from earlier crypto ambitions, its experience in blockchain and digital identity continues to inform its approach to secure digital platforms and data governance. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) Microsoft sits at the center of the AI, cloud, and enterprise software convergence, with Azure serving as one of the world’s leading hyperscale cloud platforms. The company’s deep partnership with OpenAI has driven massive demand for AI-optimized data centers, GPUs, and networking infrastructure. Microsoft is also investing heavily in energy procurement, nuclear partnerships, and grid resilience to support long-term AI growth. Beyond AI, Microsoft remains a dominant force in cybersecurity through its integrated enterprise security stack, making it a critical vendor for governments and corporations navigating rising digital threats. Its cloud services also support blockchain, identity, and compliance solutions at institutional scale. Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) Palantir specializes in data integration, analytics, and AI-driven decision platforms, with deep roots in national security, defense, and critical infrastructure. Its software enables governments and enterprises to fuse vast datasets, apply AI models, and make operational decisions in complex, high-risk environments. As AI adoption accelerates, Palantir is increasingly positioned as an application-layer beneficiary of data center and cloud expansion, rather than an infrastructure provider itself. The company’s focus on secure, auditable AI systems aligns with growing concerns around cybersecurity, compliance, and the use of AI in sensitive domains. Palantir’s platforms are also relevant to monitoring crypto-related risks, supply chains, and financial networks, particularly for state and institutional clients. By.

Title: One Year of Wins: Trump's Top Accomplishments in First Year of 'Golden Age'
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2026/01/20/trumps-top-accomplishments-first-year-golden-age/
Time Published: 2026-01-20T11:00:06Z
Full Content:
President Donald Trump worked at warp speed to “Make America Great Again” in his first year back in office, and the results, on countless fronts, have been bountiful. Trump inherited from former President Joe Biden a country reeling from a wounded economy and porous border policies that led to mass illegal immigration and a globe facing destabilization with the advent of two major wars in the Middle East and Europe under his predecessor. On day one of his administration, January 20, 2025, Trump began to take sweeping action to address issues inherited from the Biden administration with 26 executive orders — a harbinger of the breakneck speed at which he would work to implement the MAGA agenda. In total, the Federal Register shows he signed 228 executive orders throughout the first full year of his second term — and that is without mentioning the transformative legislation he signed into law and highly successful foreign policy initiatives he embarked upon. “President Trump accomplished more in one year than many presidents did in eight. The President delivered on every major campaign promise — securing the border, stopping Biden’s inflation crisis, signing the largest middle-class tax cuts in history, ending woke DEI nonsense, and restoring American strength on the world stage,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Breitbart News on Monday. “Under President Trump’s leadership, America is safer, stronger, and more prosperous than ever before, and the best is yet to come.” Trump implemented his wildly successful tariff policies that produced many positive outcomes without spiking inflation, defying critics who claimed it would, began to heal the American economy, secured the southern border, settled or de-escalated numerous conflicts around the globe through his “peace through strength” foreign policy agenda, secured significant tax relief for Americans through his One Big Beautiful Bill Act, protected America’s youth and women from radical leftist trans ideology, and unleashed his and Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy’s Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) agenda. Trade Deals On “Liberation Day,” April 2, 2025, Trump instituted his worldwide tariff policy, giving the United States tremendous leverage to negotiate trade and pharmaceutical deals, broker peace deals, and drive monumental investment into the United States after policies of his predecessors led U.S.-based manufacturing to flee to foreign countries. In other words, Trump’s tariff strategy has driven many of his second-term accomplishments. Trump came out with forceful reciprocal tariffs, including a 20 percent duty on goods from the European Union (EU), a ten percent tariff on the United Kingdom, a 24 percent rate on Japanese goods, a 46 percent tariff on Vietnam, a 32 percent tariff on Taiwan, and lofty duties on scores of other countries across the planet. The results on the trade deal front in the months that followed were profound, headlined by the historic deal he reached with the EU on July 27. During a joint press conference with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at Trump Turnberry in Scotland, the leaders announced the contours of the deal, which include the EU’s commitment to purchase $750 billion in American energy and to invest $600 billion in America on top of existing investments. Moreover, the EU agreed to pay a 15 percent tariff on goods from Europe to gain access to American markets, and Trump noted that European countries were opening their markets to American goods. Von der Leyen stressed that the deal was about rebalancing the EU’s trade surplus with the United States when asked about the concessions the U.S. would make. “The starting point was an imbalance, a surplus on our side and a deficit on the U.S. side, and we wanted to rebalance the trade relation, and we wanted to do it in a way that trade goes on between the two of us across the Atlantic, because the two biggest economies should have a good trade flow between us,” she said. “I think we hit exactly the point we wanted to find: Rebalance, but enable trade on both sides, which means good jobs on both sides of the Atlantic, means prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic, and that was important for us,” she added. Trump called the agreement “the biggest deal ever made.” In 2024 alone, the countries swapped €1.68 trillion, or roughly $1.8 trillion, in goods and services, accounting for nearly 30 percent of global trade and 43 percent of global gross domestic product. The EU deal marks the centerpiece of Trump’s trade progress as a result of tariffs, and followed deals with the United Kingdom, Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam. The trade bloc of these countries alone accounted for 57 percent of global GDP and 40 percent of international trade. Trump has also struck new trade agreements with Malaysia and Cambodia, finalized during his October Southeast Asia trip. Most-Favored-Nations Deals Trump’s tariffs are paying dividends for Americans through the Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) deals he has struck with leading pharmaceutical companies, which have drastically reduced drug prices. Trump told Breitbart News outside of Air Force One on August 3 — more than a month before he announced his first deal — that there would be “tremendous” drops in drug prices when asked if he had advice for Republicans ahead of midterm elections in 2026. “We’ll be dropping drug prices. It’ll start over the next two to three months, by 1,200, 1,300, and even 1,400 percent and 500 percent, but not just 50 percent or 25 percent, which normally would be a lot because the rest of the world pays much less for the identical drug,” he continued. “And we’re going to be paying the same thing. We’re going to have a Favored Nations. We will pay as low as the lowest nation in the world.” On September 30, he announced his first agreement with Pfizer, followed by deals with Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers Squibb, Boehringer Ingelheim, Eli Lilly, EMD Serono, Genentech, Gilead Sciences, GSK, Merck, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi through the end of the year. Trump’s deals are bringing prices down dramatically on a plethora of drugs, and his agreements with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly provide prime examples. Novo Nordisk-produced Ozempic and Wegovy are dropping to $350 per month in the United States, down from $1,000 and $1,350, respectively, while Eli Lilly-made GLP-1 drug Zepbound is falling to $346 per month from $1,086. Trump is now calling on Congress to codify the MFN deals in the “Great Healthcare Plan.” He told Breitbart News on Friday that he gave countries an ultimatum: either agree to MFN prices for America or face tariffs. “We’re doing that by most-favored nations and other nations, whoever pays the lowest in the world, that’s what we’re going to pay. Right now, we’re paying sometimes ten times higher than other nations. So, we have favored nations, that’s been approved. Other nations have, for the most part, agreed to it, and they had no choice. Otherwise, we were going to put tariffs on them,” he said before taking off on Marine One en route to Palm Beach, Florida, for the weekend. Investments In large part thanks to Trump’s tariffs and deregulation, he has attracted massive investment into the United States from countries and companies around the world, including drug companies as part of MFN deals. Trump puts the number at $18 trillion in investment in just one year, while the White House lists $9.6 trillion in investments on its website, with some of the most consequential commitments being: “In four years of Biden, they secured less than $1 trillion of new investment in the United States … In less than one year, I have secured commitments for over $18 trillion from all over the world, the most ever for any country,” he told the Detroit Economic Club on Wednesday. Leverage for Peace The president has also wielded tariffs to secure peace agreements. He described to Fox News in October how his strategy helped yield a ceasefire or de-escalation in most of the conflicts he has settled around the world: “I think we top everybody by a lot with the tariffs and all of that. But, you know, having the ability to deal with trade, having the ability to use tariffs to help me make a point — the tariffs have brought peace to the world. I’m telling you, they brought peace to the world. And not only here, but with so many other deals. You know, I’ve made seven peace deals where countries were in many cases, 30, 31 years, 135, 137 years they’ve been fighting and millions of people being killed. And I brought peace. And I did it through — in not all cases, but probably in at least five of the seven that we’ve done so far, it was through trade. That we’re not going to deal with people that fight. We’re not going to deal, and we’re going to put tariffs on you. We’re not going to let you deal in the United States. We’ll put tariffs on you.” “And without that, without the tariffs — I mean, far more than even the money that we’re taking in, which is trillions of dollars, essentially trillions of dollars,” he continued. “Far much — more importantly, it gives you a tremendous road to peace and the saving of millions of lives, just millions and millions of lives. You look at India and Pakistan. I said, ‘Well, we’re not going to do business with either of you if you don’t — if you don’t put it together.’ These are two nuclear nations that were — seven planes were shot down as you know, and they were really at it. They were going at it, and I said, ‘We’re not going to do any business with you. We’re not going to have anything to do with you. We’re going to put massive tariffs on you, both — in both cases.’ And they said, ‘Well, we got to start talking about this. This is tremendous amounts of money and power we’re dealing with.’” Trump added, “And within 24 hours, I had a peace deal. They made — they stopped. They stopped the fighting. And we can go one after another. You’ve been really nice enough to announce all of the deals, but there have been many deals. And a lot of them — a lot of the settlements were based on trade.” Speaking at the Ford facility in Dearborn, Michigan, last Tuesday, Trump touted that his “economic boom” is underway. The data from a full year in office backs it up. The Atlanta Fed projects the Trump economy grew at 5.3 percent GDP in the fourth quarter — an extremely robust number despite likely being hindered by the 43-day Democrat government shutdown in the fall. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett predicted in November that the Democrat shutdown was costing the United States $15 billion per week and would drop fourth-quarter GDP growth by one percent to 1.5 percent. Based on Hassett’s comments, the highly impressive fourth-quarter projection would presumably be even higher if there were no shutdown. This immense growth comes on the heels of a third quarter in which GDP “rose at a seasonally and inflation-adjusted 4.3 percent annual rate,” as Breitbart News noted. The substantial GDP figures come as Trump has halted Biden-era inflation while overseeing rising wages for workers, giving Americans more buying power with their dollar. Over the last three months, core inflation registered at just 1.6 percent, the president said last week — a welcome reprieve after runaway inflation under Biden at levels unseen since the Jimmy Carter administration in the late 1970s. Per White House data, while Biden’s policies led to a 22 percent increase in car prices, a 37 percent rise in hotel rates, a 32 percent jump in airfare, and a 31 percent increase in gasoline prices, Trump, as of late December, had presided over price decreases across all such categories. Wages under Biden for the typical private-sector worker dwindled $2,919 on average, according to White House data. In contrast, wages climbed $1,048 for the typical private-sector worker in just 11 months under Trump. Blue-collar workers are seeing particularly significant boosts. Factory worker wages were up $1,300, construction worker wages climbed $1,826, and miners’ wages soared by $3,336 from January into December. “For the first time in years, wages are rising much faster than inflation,” Trump said in a December address to the nation. The stock market has repeatedly hit all-time highs under the 47th president. White House data states the S&P reached 37 record highs in 2025, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average broke records 18 times. On New Year’s Day, Breitbart News Texas’s Bob Price and Randy Clark exclusively reported that “the Trump administration’s border team closed out [2025] with a historically low apprehension rate of less than 109,000 illegal aliens” for the year. The figure, which includes approximately 6,400 apprehensions along the southern border in December, underscores the effectiveness of the Trump administration’s border crackdown after policies of the Biden administration, including catch-and-release, allowed for historic illegal immigration. “Once again, we have a record low number of encounters at the border and the 7th straight month of zero releases. Month after month, we are delivering results that were once thought impossible: the most secure border in history and unmatched enforcement successes,” said Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem in a statement released in early December. “Thanks to President Trump’s leadership and the dedication of DHS law enforcement, America’s borders are safer than ever before.” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Breitbart News Texas that in under one year, “President Trump has delivered some of the most historic and consequential achievements in presidential history — and this Administration is just getting started.” “Under President Trump’s leadership, we are making America safe again and putting the American people first,” McLaughlin added. “In record-time we have secured the border, taken the fight to cartels, and arrested thousands upon thousands of criminal illegal aliens.” Border crossings throughout 2025 dropped a staggering 93 percent, and 130,000 feet of temporary barriers were erected, according to the DHS, while the construction of the rest of Trump’s border wall is underway as commissioned through the One Big Beautiful Bill. The DHS removed over 622,000 illegal aliens in 2025 alone. The removals are in addition to 1.9 million illegal aliens who had self-deported as of December. Trump has settled or de-escalated eight conflicts or wars around the globe since returning to office, led by his historic Middle East peace deal to stop the war between Israel and Hamas, which began after Hamas’s brutal October 7, 2023, terrorist attacks. The president announced in a Truth Social post on October 8 that Hamas had agreed to his framework for a 20-point peace deal to end the war, including releasing all living and deceased hostages. Within days, the president jetted off to the Middle East to speak at the Knesset in Israel on October 13. Hamas released all 20 remaining living hostages on October 13. As of December 4, the remains of one deceased hostage, Ran Gvili, had not been returned, according to the American Jewish Committee. Trump, along with Arab leaders in the region, participated in a “Peace in the Middle East” signing ceremony in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, hours after he spoke at the Knesset. “So together, let us continue in the spirit of cooperation and goodwill that has finally brought us to this incredible, historic breakthrough,” Trump said at a press conference with world leaders following the signing ceremony. “If we do, together we will reach the Middle East’s incredible destiny — a safe and prosperous and beautiful crossroads of culture and commerce, faith in humanity, and geographic center,” he added. “This will be the geographic center of the world.” On December 4, Trump signed another historic peace agreement, brokered by his administration, between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of Rwanda at the recently renamed Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace in Washington, DC. The agreement marked the end of three decades of conflict between the two countries. “In this holy season we prepare to celebrate the birth of the Prince of Peace, we have come to the U.S. Institute of Peace, to sign a historic agreement that will end one of the longest-running conflicts anywhere in the world, with far more than ten million people killed,” Trump said. “Today, we commit to stopping decades of violence and bloodshed and to begin a new era of harmony and cooperation between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda,” he added. “I want to thank the two courageous leaders. They are courageous leaders.” These are just two of many conflicts or wars Trump helped end since returning to office. He has also quelled disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan, India and Pakistan, Thailand and Cambodia, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Iran and Israel. A ceasefire to end “The 12 Day War” between Israel and Iran came days after the United States carried out operation “Midnight Hammer” to neutralize Iran’s nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. Trump and his administration also halted what could have been an escalation between Serbia and Kosovo, Turkish media reported. Trump’s foreign policy footprint continued to grow to start 2026, with operation “Absolute Resolve” on January 3, in which the United States captured former Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro, without a casualty of U.S. servicemembers or loss of any U.S. equipment. “We’re going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition. We don’t want to be involved with having somebody else get in, and we have the same situation that we had for the last long period of years,” Trump said in a press conference after the operation. Trump’s efforts on the foreign policy front earned him the Inaugural FIFA Peace Prize in December during the World Cup draw at the Trump-Kennedy Center. Trump shared that the peace prize is “truly one of the great honors of my life,” and “beyond awards … we saved millions and millions of lives.” During his meeting with anti-socialist Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado last week, Machado presented him with her 2025 Nobel Peace Prize “In Gratitude for [his] Extraordinary Leadership in Promoting Peace through Strength, Advancing Diplomacy, and Defending Liberty and Prosperity.” Another shining achievement of Trump’s — and hands down the biggest on the legislative front — was the passage and signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. To date, the bill serves as Trump’s legacy legislation, making permanent the 2017 Trump tax cuts and implementing significant tax deductions for tipped and overtime workers, as promised in his 2024 campaign policy proposal. Waiters, bartenders, casino dealers, and other tipped workers can deduct up to $25,000 on their tipped income starting this tax season, while overtime workers can use up to a $12,500 deduction. The House Ways and Means Committee projects that Americans could get $191 billion in net new tax relief this year, with filers potentially seeing an additional $1,000 on their tax refunds coming this spring. “Millions of Americans will see the working families’ tax cuts put more money in their pockets when they file taxes this coming spring. In our tax relief bill, Republicans wasted no time and ensured that we cut taxes on income earned this year. Americans voted to have more money in their wallet, and that’s exactly what President Trump and Republicans delivered,” Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith (R-MO) said in November. “Tax refunds are a big deal for a lot of American families. It covers home repairs, health care, or summer vacations; all of which became completely unaffordable under Joe Biden. Thanks to the working families tax cuts, more Americans will have greater financial security and ability to provide for their future,” he added. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act allows a maximum annual tax deduction of $10,000 for interest paid on loans for vehicles that were assembled in the United States, as long as the filer has a modified adjusted gross income of less than $100,000 or less than $200,000 for joint filers. Beyond tax cuts, the law delivers on border security by commissioning the completion of Trump’s border wall, funding mass deportation operations, and establishing the Trump investment accounts for America’s youth, with a $1,000 seed investment from the Treasury for U.S. citizens born from 2025 to 2028. Trump has taken substantial steps throughout his second term to protect women and children from radical left-wing transgender ideology. In February 2025, he signed an executive order to protect women’s sports from male participants. “With this executive order, the war on women’s sports is over,” he said at the signing. As Breitbart News reported: The order contains several measures, the first of which is to re-write federal Title IX education rules to withhold federal funds from schools that allow transgender athletes to play as females. Another aspect of the order would charge the Department of Homeland Security with the task of denying visas to foreign trans athletes who want to enter the U.S. to compete among women. After signing the order, Trump cited the importance of female athletes and their role in the 2028 Olympics, which are scheduled for Los Angeles. He also mentioned the World Cup. “My administration will not stand by and watch men beat and batter female athletes. We’re just not going to let it happen,” the president said. Several members of the Save Women’s Sports community, including former NCAA swimming champion Riley Gaines, witnessed the signing. Just over a week after he took office in January 2025, Trump signed an executive order to ban “chemical or surgical mutilation” sex-change procedures for minors. “Accordingly, it is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called ‘transition’ of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures,” the order reads. The implementation of Trump and Kennedy’s MAHA agenda is well underway, with the latest moves including the new, inverted food pyramid and the return of whole and two percent milk to America’s schools. The White House unveiled reformed dietary guidelines for Americans on January 7 at a White House press briefing with Kennedy, Food and Drug Administration chief Dr. Marty Makary, and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz. The guidelines promote a diet rich in protein, healthy fats, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and dairy. “Today marks a decisive change in federal nutrition policy made possible by President Trump’s leadership and the work of MAHA moms and public health advocates who demanded reform,” Kennedy said. “These guidelines replace corporate-driven assumptions with common-sense goals and gold-standard scientific integrity. These new guidelines will revolutionize our nation’s food culture and make America healthy again,” he added. Makary said that “a corrupt food pyramid” had been pushed on Americans for decades, focusing on “demonizing natural, healthy saturated fats, telling you not to eat eggs and steak, and ignoring a giant blind spot: refined carbohydrates, added sugars, ultra-processed food.” He added that most children are consuming a diet including “ultra-processed food,” which he called an “epidemic.” “We have 40 percent of our kids now with a chronic disease. It is not their fault. This is something that is the result of bad advice from the government and a medical establishment that for decades peddled research from a flawed 1960s model,” Makary added. Days later, Trump signed the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act to once again make whole and two percent milk available in America’s schools, after they were virtually banned by the Obama-era Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. In early December, Trump ordered a review of the U.S. childhood vaccine schedule in concert with peer nations such as Japan, Denmark, and Germany, which recommend fewer vaccines for children than the U.S. schedule. He directed aligning the U.S. schedule with peer nations if their schedules were deemed superior in the review. While the U.S. has recommended 18 vaccines for children, Denmark recommends ten, Japan 14, and Germany 15. As HHS noted on January 5: After consulting with health ministries of peer nations, considering the assessment’s findings, and reviewing the decision memo presented by National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, Food and Drug Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary, and CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz, Acting Director O’Neill formally accepted the recommendations and directed the CDC to move forward with implementation. … The assessment reviewed 20 peer, developed nations and found that the U.S. is a global outlier among developed nations in both the number of diseases addressed in its routine childhood vaccination schedule and the total number of recommended doses but does not have higher vaccination rates than such countries. In fact, many peer nations that recommend fewer routine vaccines achieve strong child health outcomes and maintain high vaccination rates through public trust and education rather than mandates. For example, in 2024, the U.S. recommended more childhood vaccines than any peer nation, and more than twice as many doses as some European nations. The updated schedule “Recommends all vaccines for which there is consensus among peer nations.” Trump’s bounty of accomplishments does not end there. As Leavitt noted, he has rooted out Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies from the federal government, and according to Axios, was on track to oversee “the largest one-year drop in murders the nation has ever recorded” as of late December.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: Consolidation in a ‘Hunger Games scenario’ – and a true loss for the industry

This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → It’s January, and (as per…) the social feeds of most media practitioners are awash with predictions of how the industry will pan out in the coming calendar year. Many such missives are indistinguishable from the next, but among the platitudinous musings, last week’s 2026 outlook presentation from Arete Research stood out, complete with signature-style hot takes from the firm’s noted analysts Richard Kramer and Rocco Strauss. The Hunger Games First off, on a compliance note, the below does not constitute investment advice, with the whirlwind January 15 presentation exploring anomalies in the marketplace, all of which are likely to result in a Hunger Games-style scenario over the next 12 months, per the duo. All this takes place within the context of the media industry’s “Big Three” – Google, Meta, and Amazon – all of whom absorbed even more ad spend than earlier expected in 2025. “We are struggling to see from where in the economy we’re finding these incremental pools of spend,” observed Kramer, noting how this results in “Hunger Games competition.” Indeed, fellow presenter Strauss separately outlined his opinion on how the “Hunger Games scenario” will likely play out with media agencies, as holding companies “don’t have much more to give.” Of course, all this happens within the context of the AI arms race – Arete’s Kramer pointed out that the 2026 chapter of this era would see a move from “automation to action” in the rush to launch agentic offerings. He further observed the resulting “spaghetti junction of partnerships” in this rush, as demonstrated by last week’s tie-up between Apple and Google to power the latest version of Siri. “Distribution really wins in tech, and Google here seems to be in the poll position,” observed Kramer. “They have multiple billion-user properties of their own, they have captured end-point distribution with Apple… the Walled Gardens [continue to] play gatekeepers.” A ‘tale of woe’ & consolidation It won’t be news to Digiday readers that many independent ad tech companies listed on public markets had a difficult 2025, with this cohort’s talisman, The Trade Desk, seeing its stock price fall 70%. “It was a tale of woe,” observed Kramer, noting how of the near-dozen companies within this cohort, only Taboola and Zeta Global were in positive territory, with pretty much the entire category underperforming the S&P 500. It’s this downward pressure, including the need for ad tech companies to find new revenue streams and manage the risks of disruption as ad spend on the open web declines, that’s likely to lead to further consolidation within this cohort. Arete’s analyst duo noted that many developments in this sector of the ad industry will hinge on the outcome of Google’s antitrust cases. Of course, independent ad tech can’t bet its collective future on the defenestration of Google Ad Manager, as evidenced by the growth of Amazon’s demand-side platform – a dynamic likely contributing to the precipitous decline in the stock price of other DSPs – with Arete Research predicting consolidation to gather pace. “Many ad tech companies seem to be for sale right now, or looking to huddle together… this is going to accelerate in 2026,” observed Kramer, who later went on to note, “with the open web, shrinking the space for traditional SSP and DSP buying [ad space] at open web is a reducing market.” As to the potential nature of such exits? Strauss referenced speculation that Criteo may be up for sale, noting that entities such as OpenAI, PayPal, and Shopify are likely interested in assets as they seek to expand their revenue streams. Strauss again emphasized that such observations are not investment advice, although he pointed to Amazon as a blueprint for potential new market entrants. “It took Amazon a good four years to build that stuff, to hire the team, to build it, to have a proper data[set] and so on,” he added. The full presentation can be accessed via here. Elsewhere last week, the tragic death of OpenX CEO John Gentry emerged, with the breadth and depth of tributes to him serving as testament to the high regard in which he was held. Insights from the IPA Bellwether Q4 ’25: The EC further pushes to rein-in Google’s ad tech monopoly The European Commission published provisional findings on Google’s ad tech stack, ruling that its wares (primarily AdX and DoubleClick for Publishers) have been dominant for more than a decade, further recommending billions in financial penalties, with a forced divestiture also in prospect. ‘We don’t care if you don’t use our UX anymore’: Yahoo recasts its DSP as a data backbone for the agentic world Yahoo is intentionally making its demand-side platform (DSP) less sticky. “A big reason everyone wants agentic to happen is to make DSPs go away.” — One anonymous source opines on the subtext for the development of AdCP, etc. Ad tech’s Hunger Games are real… Advertising group Dentsu’s push to sell global unit close to collapse The Financial Times reports that private equity groups are turning their noses up at the international arm of the Japanese ad juggernaut. A Google VP explains why ads make sense in AI search but not Gemini — yet With Google’s Gemini surging in popularity, speculation has been bubbling in the ad industry that the app might be on the cusp of introducing ads to capitalize on the moment — and help offset the hefty AI infrastructure costs. Google’s Dany Taylor explains more to BI’s Lara O’Reilly. Google’s agentic commerce plan is here — what marketers must knowGoogle has provided a blueprint for major brands, writes Ad Age’s Asa Hiken, showing them how to connect to its AI commerce ecosystem that attempts to automate everything from shopping to pizza delivery. However, there are challenges for marketers navigating this complex landscape as Google builds its agentic framework parallel to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. McClatchy Media accuses Google in federal court of monopolizing online ad sales It’s that company again. We think you get the idea by now… Advertising is coming to ChatGPT, but not fast enough to outrun incumbent platform giants — one in particular. The European Commission is probing the industry’s response to Google’s proposed behavioral remedies. The joint venture is involved in multiple pitches for businesses with a strong U.S. base and international aspirations, while visiting pitch consultants to make sure it’s part of the consideration set.

Title: California Billionaire Tax: Why Some Billionaires Are Planning Exits
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathangoldman/2026/01/19/california-billionaire-tax-why-some-billionaires-are-planning-exits/

ByNathan Goldman, Contributor. The 2026 Billionaire Tax Act has sent shockwaves across the U.S. This act is generally defined by its proposed one-time tax of five percent on California residents’ net worth if they have over $1 billion of wealth. There are clear theoretical arguments to be made for the bill’s passage as it would raise an estimated $100 billion for health care and educational needs. However, recent analysis suggests that design choices and the current wording of the act could have devastating legal and economic consequences, including some billionaires being taxed well beyond the proposed 5% rate. What follows summarizes the current state of the proposed California billionaire tax, the recent criticism of the act and the design choices that may need to be reconsidered before it is potentially put up to a vote. The 2026 Billionaire Tax Act was filed by Jim Mangia, president and CEO of St. John’s Community Health, and Suzanne Jimenez, who represents the SEIU-UHW health care union, in October of 2025. The act has since been put forth as formal legislation on Nov. 26, 2025, under the header of Initiative No. 25-0024. The act is currently collecting signatures to appear on the November 2026 election ballot. The 2026 Billionaire Tax Act enacts a 5% tax on the wealth of California residents who have accumulated over $1 billion in wealth. The tax is unusual because it is a tax on wealth, rather than income, and the tax would include payments related to unrealized gains. According to Forbes, this act would raise $100 billion from California’s 200 or more billionaires between 2027 and 2031 (assuming no taxpayer migration or successful legal challenges), and these funds would go to replenishing funding for California’s Medicaid and childhood education program. According to the bill, taxpayers’ wealth will be defined by “personal property and wealth, including shares of capital stock, bonds, or other evidences of indebtedness, and any legal or equitable interest therein.” Thus, the bill is taking the stance that all assets shall be considered when determining whether a taxpayer is a billionaire and subject to the wealth tax. The bill does allow a phase-in that will subject the taxpayer to the 5% tax fully once their wealth reaches $1.1 billion. Only a small amount of assets (up to $5 million) can be excluded from the taxpayer’s net worth when calculating their billionaire status and wealth tax liability owed. Even though the bill will not be voted on until November, the initiative proposes a retroactive effective date of Jan. 1, 2026, a feature likely to face legal challenge. As it is currently written, this retroactive application would subject California billionaires to the 5% wealth tax immediately. The proposal has already prompted significant responses among California billionaires. According to The New York Times, Peter Thiel and Larry Page have openly discussed leaving California due to this tax. Furthermore, Fox Business reports that real estate broker Julian Johnston is working directly with three billionaires about moving from California to South Florida due to this billionaire wealth tax. California already imposes the highest and most progressive income tax rate in the U.S., with a top marginal tax rate of 13.3% on income over $1 million. This billionaire wealth tax would represent an incremental tax on high-net-worth taxpayers in addition to the already high taxes that they pay, leading to possible perceived inequity over this tax. However, not all California billionaires are opposed to this plan. According to CNBC, Nvidia’s Jensen Huang has said that the additional taxes owed (a reported $7.75 billion) is “perfectly fine” with him. While this news is promising, it needs to be taken with caution for two reasons. First, even if some California billionaires pay the wealth tax, if a significant number do not and challenge paying it, California may lose out on those tax revenues both for the wealth tax and in the future. Second, just because a billionaire says they will support this does not mean that they actually will. In fact, just 2½ years ago, Jeff Bezos supported Washington’s proposed billionaire tax. According to the Tax Foundation, he then announced a move to Miami, Florida, shortly before its passage, allowing him to forgo paying any wealth tax and upending the legislation’s potential. Potentially the biggest criticism of this legislation is not from the billionaires themselves, but, instead, from the state’s current governor, Gavin Newsom. According to the Los Angeles Times, Newsom strongly opposes this ballot measure, saying that it is badly drafted and will not end up aiding the essential state services it is geared toward. Given Newsom’s prominent role in both the state and the nationwide Democratic Party, his opposition likely carries a lot of weight among potential voters this November. In theory, funding health care and education needs by asking billionaires to contribute a small percentage of their wealth may seem like a popular and plausible path toward addressing a key problem in California. However, there have already been numerous issues raised with this plan. For instance, Baker Botts highlights issues like the Dormant Commerce Clause lead to a failure of the Complete Auto Test because worldwide assets would be subject to a California tax. This article also highlights numerous legal concerns associated with the retroactive nature of the legislation, the legislation being aimed at single out specific individuals (Bill of Attainder), the Uniformity Clause of the California Constitution, among other things. The Tax Foundation highlights that, as a function of design issues and potential drafting errors, the 5% wealth tax is actually much larger than that. In particular, a billionaire’s valuation is based on voting interests. The article uses Tony Xu, the founder of DoorDash, as an example. Xu owns 2.6% of the company but controls 57.6% of the vote. In this example, Xu has a $2.41 billion net worth based on his ownership in the company. However, as a consequence of the bill as currently written, Xu’s wealth tax consequence would be $4.17 billion, or 173% of his company ownership. The Tax Foundation highlights five other California billionaires whose tax liability would be well over the 5% being advertised, including David Baszucki (Roblox), Sergey Brin (Alphabet), Larry Page (Alphabet), Mark Zuckerberg (Meta), and Jensen Huang (Nvidia). This raises questions about whether affected taxpayers would remain in California due to the unusually high wealth tax rate they would be facing. Other considerations raised by the article are that the levying of the tax might force billionaires to sell a large number of their shares (potentially tanking the stock price and causing other financial issues), the assessment rules for private businesses might result in them being overvalued, large penalties for understating liabilities, unusual language defining anti-tax avoidance measures, and a substantial tax that can be assigned to taxpayers that get married or divorced. While the proposed California billionaire tax is still far from a reality, both the potential benefits and consequences have become increasingly apparent. Should billionaires decide to depart California, they will still be liable for paying the wealth tax if the bill is passed. However, whether and under what circumstances this tax is challenged in court, upheld, and collected is a completely different story. Thus, California lawmakers and taxpayers must carefully balance the costs and benefits of attempting to levy such a tax on its 200 billionaires given the uncertainty in the outcomes.

Tara Turk-Haynes hired yoga instructors and meditation gurus to help employees handle burnout at the media company where she worked. She's not doing anything like that today. Wellness perks are no longer "a thing," said Turk-Haynes, now an independent HR consultant in Los Angeles. "Attracting and retaining talent is not a business challenge right now." The white-collar workplace has gotten a lot less cuddly in the past few years, as the economic bargain between employers and employees has been redefined. Perks have vanished, in-office mandates are on the rise, and layoffs continue even as profits hold up — changes that reflect a system that prioritizes shareholder returns over stakeholder capitalism and corporate loyalty. With job openings thinning, wages struggling to keep pace with inflation, and AI looming as a threat to entire occupations, the recalibration is altering how advancement and compensation are determined inside companies — a new reality that some workers view as destabilizing, and others see as a long-overdue reset. "When COVID happened, there was a shift in power from employers to employees with the Great Resignation," said Jessica Kriegel, chief strategy officer at workplace consulting firm Culture Partners in Sacramento, Calif. "The pendulum swung really far. Now it's swinging back." This story is part of Business Insider's series "The Future of Capitalism," which looks at ways Americans' confidence in capitalism has been eroding and what related changes in our economy mean for your work and wealth. Earlier this month, Meta began rolling out a new employee evaluation program that ties career advancement and financial rewards to measurable impact, while Citi CEO Jane Fraser issued a memo saying she expects higher performance this year and to see "the last vestiges of old, bad habits fall away."

In August, AT&T's John Stankey told managers the company had moved away from a tenure-based "employment deal" toward one "focused on rewarding capability, contribution, and commitment." Meanwhile, some CEOs, particularly those aligned with the Trump administration, have become more outspoken about their political views, suggesting diminished concern about alienating talent. In November, Palantir CEO Alex Karp told analysts on an earnings call that his software company is the first "to be completely anti-woke." The shift toward a more explicitly capitalistic workplace is taking hold even as leaders across the political spectrum are championing increased government involvement in private enterprise. The US, for example, has recently taken equity stakes in about a dozen private companies—an unusual expansion of direct federal ownership in the private sector. Now, even though the economy is relatively healthy, most employers are planning to trim or maintain head count this year, survey data show, while white-collar workers are job-hugging and bracing for more layoffs. "There is pressure on CEOs from investors and shareholders to continue to grow," said Kriegel. "And that pressure is getting pushed down onto employees." The current moment stands apart, though it's not the first time the pendulum has shifted toward employers. The dot-com bust in the early 2000s and the global financial crisis from 2007 to 2009 also cooled hiring. Both events, however, coincided with steep stock market declines, whereas the post-pandemic period has been marked by generally strong results on Wall Street. "The stock market's doing well, record-setting, and yet companies are squeezing their employees," said Peter Cappelli, professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. The rise of AI has also posed a new existential threat to workers. Many employers see the potential for the technology to replace human talent through automation, and some have cited AI directly or indirectly as a reason for layoffs. "Before asking for more headcount and resources, teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI," wrote Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke in an April memo to the company's employees. To be sure, employers' labor costs — typically their largest expense — are on the rise. For one, the average price of employer-sponsored health insurance in the US is expected to increase 6.7% this year, up from 4.5% in 2024, according to consulting firm Mercer. Businesses have also incurred a new expense: AI investments, including chatbot licenses and employee training. Research firm IDC forecasts that US-based firms will spend roughly $320 billion on AI hardware, software, and services this year. Those costs come as corporate leaders are navigating what they describe as a shakier economic environment. Mentions of "economic uncertainty" on US public company earnings calls more than doubled in 2025 compared with the prior year, according to market-intelligence platform AlphaSense. Employment experts say the uncertainty helps explain why the job market has been stuck in a low-hire, low-fire state. Even as large companies such as Starbucks, Southwest Airlines, and Disney announced massive layoffs last year, the overall rate of layoffs and discharges stayed below historical norms, Labor Department data show. The result is a labor market full of contradictions, said Nicole Bachaud, an economist at ZipRecruiter. "That's why it feels so weird," she said. The unemployment rate finished last year at 4.4%, near historic lows. Still, many professionals lack confidence in the job market as career opportunities in once-reliable sectors, such as technology and the federal government, have thinned. "Psychologically, it's damaging," said Lars Schmidt, a recruiting executive in the Washington, D.C., area. In industries where jobs were plentiful, workers generally knew how long it would take to find a new position if they craved change. Now, "most people don't have any safe prediction of what that may be," Schmidt said. Another drag on confidence is the bleak employment outlook. A recent survey of US CEOs by the Yale School of Management shows that nearly two-thirds plan to maintain or reduce head count in 2026. Further, average annual pay increases are forecast to remain flat in 2026, despite continued high inflation and after shrinking in recent years, according to Mercer. These factors may help explain why workers feel economically insecure. Nearly a third of Americans expect their finances to worsen this year, according to a December survey by Bankrate. That is the highest level of pessimism since 2018, when the personal-finance site began asking consumers about their financial outlook. Against that backdrop, workers are increasingly reluctant to quit. The US quit rate has fallen below pre-pandemic norms, federal data show, even as more employers mandate five days in the office and track workers' hours and AI usage. All of this leaves workers with little appetite for pushback, said Jeff LeBlanc, a management lecturer at Bentley University. "You're not going to see a big revolt," he said. "I don't think people have it in them right now." Though the overall job market forecast is gloomy, there are some bright spots for workers. Demand is robust for people who can build out AI applications across industries, said Aditya Challapally, who teaches a course for Stanford Online about generative AI. "This is a small, but rapidly growing niche," he said. AI fluency can help just about anyone get ahead in their career, added Challapally. Workers who understand AI are "able to move faster, make better decisions, and take on higher-leverage work," he said. Hiring is also strong in healthcare, social assistance, and leisure and hospitality, according to recent data from the US Labor Department. Laura Ullrich, director of economic research at job site Indeed, expects the overall labor market to improve as long as the economy continues to grow. "This low-hire, low-fire environment cannot last forever," she said. "At some point, companies will need to start hiring more." In the meantime, some workers are regaining a sense of control by taking on freelance or contract gigs that they could parley into full-time work should they get laid off. Others are starting their own businesses, tapping AI tools to get up and running quickly. Adopting a side hustle is safer than quitting a job and launching a search for a new one right now because the market is just so competitive, said John Ferguson, an HR consultant and former chief human resources officer at NASCAR. "If you don't have the next opportunity lined up, I encourage you to stay where you are," he said. "But also plan your exit strategy." Jump to

Here's your firmware update for January 16, 2026 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. This week, Meta turned its back on VR, and Apple caved to Google in its hunt for an AI update for Siri. To catch up on these and the other seven biggest tech news stories of the week, scroll down to see our recaps of the big things that happened. When you're done, check out the seven new movies and TV shows to watch this weekend. It hasn’t been a great time for drone fans in the US, with the FCC recently banning the sale of new, foreign-made drones – and a separate proposal from the US Department of Commerce taking aim at all Chinese drone imports (including existing models that have already been launched). Well, fortunately, a U-turn from the latter has removed that particular restriction from the equation for now. That means that stock of previously approved drones like the DJI Mavic 3 Pro and the Antigravity A1 can still be legally imported into the US. Still, with the FCC effectively banning the sale of foreign-made drones that it hasn’t approved (in other words, all new models), the future still looks bleak for Stateside drone fans. We got our first look at Sophie Turner as filming on Amazon’s Tomb Raider TV show begins, and the recreation of the character’s iconic video game look is perfect, highlighting to fans of the games how seriously Amazon is taking this adaptation. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Obviously, this is just a still of Turner in her costume, but she is undeniably Lara Croft in it, and if similar care and attention has been paid to the rest of the cast (which includes Jason Isaacs, Sigourney Weaver, and Martin Bobb-Semple, among others) as well as the show’s story, we could be in for a real treat. No release date has been given yet, but we can’t rule out a mid- to late 2026 launch. Over the past few weeks, Spotify Premium subscribers have been encountering AI-generated music recommendations in their Discover Weekly and Release Radar playlists, prompting the music platform to introduce labels to identify AI-generated music in a monster Reddit thread. According to users who have experienced this, the issue with AI music on Spotify is only getting worse; the problem doesn’t lie with AI music itself, but with the deception on Spotify’s part, which is what’s getting under people’s skin. This has led many paying users to think it’s part of a wider, secret business plan and that Spotify is deliberately doing this to avoid paying artists further. In other news, Spotify has also raised subscription prices for US members, affecting all tiers. It marks the third price increase since 2023, which many people are attributing to the maintenance of Spotify Lossless. This week, Meta seemed to give up on VR as it slashed Reality Labs jobs, including closing down several VR game studios, and ending updates for the excellent VR fitness platform Supernatural. The news is a tragedy for fans of the Meta Quest system as it suggests Meta’s future support for its headsets will be at least a little lackluster, and Hamish Hector argued that, as things stand, he’s only interested in the Steam Frame. It’s no secret Reality Labs has been hemorrhaging funds for some time, but this major about-turn from Meta might lead some to wonder if you can trust the company not to change course again if its new AI glasses focus starts to go awry. Google has just dropped "Personal Intelligence" for Gemini, and it might be the most significant leap for AI assistants yet. This upgrade allows Gemini to securely tap into your personal Google ecosystem (Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube) to provide deep, individualized context for your queries. The capabilities are genuinely impressive: imagine Gemini diagnosing a car issue by checking your Gmail purchase history for the model, scanning your Photos for service records, and pulling DIY solutions from YouTube. It’s the "true" AI assistant we’ve been waiting for. Interestingly, given the newly announced Apple-Google AI partnership, this looks like a sneak peek at how the next-gen Siri might function in iOS 27. Apple got served a huge slice of humble pie this week, as it conceded Ai supremacy to Google announcing that Siri’ s next-gen version will be backed by Gemini. A lot of questions remain, but in a joint statement Apple and Google revealed “These [Gemini] models will help power future Apple Intelligence features, including a more personalized Siri coming this year.”Apple first unveiled its plans to launch an AI-upgraded Siri during WWDC 2024 but almost two years later we’re still waiting for the upgrade. The company has since promised a Spring 2026 launch, and with Google Gemini it might finally make that happen. Well, we have officially had the first major outage of 2026, and it was a massive, nearly 8-hour outage that took out Verizon's cell service for customers across the United States on January 14, 2026. You can see our full reporting in the live blog linked below, but it was a serious, hours-long event that saw folks with Verizon swap 5G and network bars for SOS with no access to voice, text, and data across much of the country. Down Detector reports swelled around 12:30 PM ET, with Verizon confirming the issue at 1 PM, but many folks did not see any signs of recovery until closer to 8 PM ET that evening. The carrier didn't have the best communication during the event, with only a few statements that came hours apart. The day after the outage, Verizon confirmed each account would receive a single $20 credit, which, simply put, many customers were not pleased with. The carrier also confirmed to TechRadar that it was a software issue tied to a cyber incident.

Congress Just Loaded Up On These 2 Stocks! | 13:32 Dividendology | 241K subscribers | 157,468 views | January 13, 2026 Unusual Whales (Excerpt) Read more at youtube.com ... [transcript] Congressional Trading Report 2025 Unusual Whales, the website that tracks congressional trading, just released their full report on Congress trading in 2025. And essentially like every single year, especially since 2020, there are plenty of congressional members who way outperform the S&P 500, with multiple members of Congress even returning well over 50%. Now, while this report is for the full year 2025, we’ve already seen a couple of interesting trades as we head into 2026. So, in this video, we’re going to be looking at two stocks that members of Congress have been recently buying. To analyze these two stocks, we’re going to be using forecaster.biz, which you can check out at the link in the description. It’s a tool that I’ve started using more, and I like that you can easily overlay things like sales, net income, price to earnings, and dividends over the share price, so you can see correlation. But, let’s go ahead and dive in. Stock Analysis: Broadcom (AVGO) The first stock that members of Congress have been buying is Broadcom, stock ticker AVGO. Now, this is a stock that’s already a large position in Nancy Pelosi’s portfolio. It’s currently the second largest position. And as you might already know, Broadcom’s performance over the last 5 years has just been exceptional, up 673%. If we look at the last 3 years, they’re up about 500%, and in the last year alone, up 53.76%, making it one of the best performing stocks in the S&P 500. Now, of course, what’s interesting about this is if we overlay what’s gone on with the sales for this company in the last 5 years, you can see that the share price has essentially followed the sales growth of the business. And on top of this, they’ve continued to grow dividends at a very high rate. In fact, if we scroll down, we can see back just in 2017, they were paying out about 10 cents per share in dividends. And look, now it’s more than 6x at about 65 cents per share. Congressional Trading Insights Now, let’s talk about congressional trading for a moment. If we jump over to the political tab here on Forecaster, one of the things we will notice is there is already significant congressional buying in Q1 and Q2 of 2025. I mean, we’re talking about millions of dollars in some cases, but don’t point out Q3 and Q4. There is still significant congressional buying, especially more buying than selling. Now, when it comes to stocks like Broadcom, I see a lot of mixed reviews. Obviously, the stock has done unbelievably well in the last one, three, and five years. But look at what’s been going on with the PE multiple. The PE multiple has climbed extraordinarily high, especially in the last couple of years. In fact, if we look at the fundamentals tab, Forecaster’s listing the trailing 12 months PE multiple is about 70.37. There are very few stocks in the market with that high of a PE multiple. But it’s really important that we note a stock’s PE multiple by itself tells you absolutely nothing about the company without accounting for future growth rate projections. So for example, if we jump over to the raw data, look at revenue charted out over the past few years. Again, the stock price has followed the revenue growth. It’s followed the fundamental growth, and we can see based on the trailing 12 months, this growth is continuing into 2026. Now to be fair as it relates to Broadcom, it’s important we understand where this topline growth is actually coming from because it certainly hasn’t all been organic. This company has actually pursued a lot of acquisitions over the years, and most recently they acquired VMware, and that was just a couple of years ago when revenue was sitting at about 35.8 billion. So around right here is when they made that acquisition, and obviously since then revenue has jumped quite a bit. Growth Strategy and Financials So what we can see right now is they’re pretty much pursuing growth at all costs. Let me show you an example of what I mean. If we scroll down all the way to the bottom of the income statement, look at what’s happened to average shares outstanding. We can see they’ve actually issued more shares outstanding over the past decade. Why is that the case? Typically, in most instances, that’s not something we want to see. But the reality is at certain time periods, it can actually be a good thing. If a company can issue new shares when they’re trading at an undervaluation, yes, it still dilutes shareholders, but with the capital that they raise, if they can get a very good return on investment from that capital, it can still actually be beneficial to shareholders. So, yes, they’ve been issuing new shares. On top of this, look at what’s been going on on the balance sheet. If we scroll down and look at net debt again, what do you notice? Net debt has actually grown quite a bit for this company in the last few years. They are aggressively pursuing growth. And so the ultimate measure of whether or not this is actually paying off is by looking at what’s actually going on with free cash flow. Remember, a company has five options with free cash flow. They can reinvest back into the business, pay down debt, attempt mergers and acquisitions, buy back shares, and pay out dividends. And like we saw, Broadcom has rapidly grown dividends over the last few years. So free cash flow has grown at a very high rate. We can see in 2024 they were sitting at about 19.4. Looks like trailing 12 months. They’re already sitting at 26.9. And growth, whether you’re looking at earnings or free cash flow, is expected to continue for Broadcom, especially at a high rate. Take a look at this. If we look at Broadcom and look at the average expected earnings growth over the next few years, 2026 EPS growth should be at about 50%, 2027 nearly 40%, and 2028 around 25%. This is some of the fastest earnings growth that you’ll see out of any company in the S&P 500. Valuation Considerations And so all that to say, yes, the PE multiple like we’ve seen on Forecaster looks extremely high at 70.37, but when you start to look at forward-looking PE multiples and account for that future earnings growth, it doesn’t look nearly as bad as you would think. This is why in a lot of instances, we actually want to look at the price to earnings growth multiple. Now, we’ll come back and talk about valuation in just a moment, but make sure you understand that Broadcom is not just another semiconductor company. Yes, Semiconductor Solutions is about 61% of revenue, and this is what a lot of people focus on because their products are used by companies like Google, Meta, and Anthropic. And the company already has a $73 billion backlog. That’s right, $73 billion in backlog. So essentially, if we go back and look at topline revenue, we can see in 2024, it was 51.57 billion. Their management has stated they already have 73 billion in backlog for the next 18 months. So these earnings and revenue growth projections we’ve been talking about aren’t something that analysts are pulling out of thin air. These are projections that are based on the reality of the orders that are coming in for Broadcom. That should give you more confidence in the stock. But then the other sector of the business is infrastructure software, and this is where they have made some acquisitions. But the good news is this portion of the business has extremely high margins and recurring revenue characteristics. So is it too late to buy Broadcom, or is there still potential opportunity? Well, here’s where things get interesting. Let’s assume for this stock that the PE multiple gets reduced drastically in the coming years. Maybe it falls all the way down to about 35. So essentially, the PE multiple is going to get cut in half. Let’s also assume they’re able to meet earnings growth projections and that by the year 2028, estimated EPS will be sitting at about $17.60, meaning that earnings would have to grow at a rate of around 37.5% through the year 2028. Well, here’s what we can see. All of a sudden, if EPS by 2028 is about $17.54, which is actually slightly below the average analyst estimate, you’d still be looking at a compounded annual return of 15.41%, not including the dividends. And the dividend yield is low; it’s only sitting at about 0.7%, but again, dividend growth has been exceptional. So that gives you a return of around 77%, again not including dividends, likely closer to 80% when you include dividends. So this is a great example. We have to reframe the way we think about valuation because yes, this PE multiple looks absurd at first glance, but when you consider the earnings growth projections that are actually being determined by the company’s backlog, all of a sudden the valuation doesn’t look as extreme as it would seem. And again, I think this is one of the many reasons that we’re seeing congressional members continuing to add Broadcom to their portfolio even though it performed so well in the last year after they already loaded up. Verizon Communications Stock Analysis And the second stock on our list is an interesting one. Not one you would typically expect to see on this type of list, but that’s Verizon Communications, the high-yielding dividend stock. And this stock has actually been on the list of Congress buys before, but it’s been bought even more so recently. So, look at the political buying. What do you notice? There wasn’t much activity for the last few years, but in Q4 of 2025, buying activity surged for this stock. In fact, we saw the most buying activity for Verizon that we’ve seen in the last 5 years in Q4 of 2025. Now, this is interesting because really, if we look at the share price over the last 5 years, it’s down by about 29%. If we look at it in the last 10 years, it’s not much better, down by about 9.81%. Now, total returns obviously tell a different story because the stock is a high yielder. It’s yielding about 6.7% as of right now. So, what do we make of Verizon stock right now? What’s the issue? Why is the share price not climbing? Or is it still potentially a good dividend play? Well, again, we have to remember over the long term, share price is going to follow the fundamental growth. And if we look at the sales growth over the last 5ish years, it’s really been relatively stagnant. We can see this; it hasn’t gone really anywhere. So, let’s dive into this a little bit more. If we jump back over to the fundamentals and look at the raw data, let’s take a look at revenue growth. This is what it looks like over the past decade. No wonder the share price really hasn’t moved. Revenue has not grown at a very high rate. Really, it’s been somewhat in line with inflation over the past decade. Even if we come down here and overlay the one-year revenue growth rates, we can see it’s typically in the low single-digit range. Every now and then, they’ll actually have a year of negative revenue growth. Now, if we pull up the most recent earnings report, one of the things we will notice is we can see right here, total operating revenue in the third quarter was up 1.5% year-over-year. So, slight growth in that area. If we scroll down and look at things like total Verizon consumer revenue, that saw growth of about 2.9% year-over-year. And if we look at total Verizon business revenue, that was a decrease of 2.8% year-over-year. So again, even in the most recent quarter, we’re talking about very small changes in what revenue growth has actually looked like. But that being said, with the outlook that they’re currently giving, they’re stating that they expect revenue growth to be in the range of 2 to 2.8% and adjusted EPS growth of about 1 to 3%. So they expect fundamentals to continue to grow, but it’s quite slow growth. So the reality is people who are interested in Verizon, they’re buying the stock primarily for one reason. One, they either think it’s undervalued at current prices or two, they’re buying it for the dividend. So really, let’s assess the sustainability of those dividends. Now, if we look at the dividend history for this stock, they have a history of growing those dividends even though free cash flow has not been growing at a high rate. In fact, if we jump back over to this slide, we can see they have 19 consecutive years of growing that dividend. So certainly a dividend growth stock, but the dividend growth is quite slow. And we have to remember anytime a stock is growing dividends at a rate below the rate of inflation, that’s technically not dividend growth. That’s something to keep in mind that doesn’t get discussed very often. Now, if we jump back over to their consolidated cash flow summary from their recent earnings presentation, again, we can assess the sustainability of those dividend payments. Dividends are paid out of free cash flow. And if we look at the 9 months of 2024, free cash flow is 14.5 while dividends paid out was 8.4 billion. So that’s a very sustainable dividend. And if we look at the 9 months of 2025, we can see yes, dividends are higher. They’ve grown their dividend payouts, but free cash flow is higher as well. So it continues to look like an actually very healthy around 7% starting dividend yield with relatively low leverage. It’s at least in their target range. So what we can see is yes, that starting dividend yield looks sustainable at about 6.7%. But what about the valuation at its current prices? Well, to start, we can see they trade at an extremely low PE multiple, just 8.65. Essentially the opposite of what we just saw for Broadcom. A PE multiple far below the average of the S&P 500. But again, that doesn’t tell us how the stock is actually being valued because we have to account for future growth. And as we’ve already seen, growth is very slow for Verizon Communications. Now, with that being said, we can still use a dividend discount model to value Verizon Communications. If they’re growing revenues, earnings, and free cash flow at a rate of about 2 to 3% moving forward, then dividend growth of 2.25% is sustainable moving forward. And if they can achieve that dividend growth rate, that would give them a fair value of about $44.54, implying 10% upside from their current prices. So absolutely this is by no means a high growth stock, not even a medium growth stock. It’s a very mature company that’s a very capital-intensive business with a lot of debt on the balance sheet. But with that being said, it does look manageable. The dividend looks sustainable and based on just a 2 to 2.5% dividend growth rate, the stock actually does look slightly undervalued. So we may see this share price revert back to its intrinsic value. But don’t expect a lot of growth past that other than the starting dividend yield that you’ll be receiving close to 6.67%. So there you go. Those are two stocks that members of Congress have been recently adding to their portfolio. Very interesting! Broadcom now going at $351. per share I guess my Megalomaniac ambitions will remain on the distant back burner for the time being. By contrast, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is cheap, pays over 7 percent at this price. The expectation of lower interest rates may be the main reason for the interest by the Critters, but they may also be loaded up with inside information. 👍 It’s never too late to start. 😁 Look at the chart for VZ. It’s movement over years is bad. Buy some AVGO over the weekend, and sell it about noon on Monday. VZ seems to pay a reliable 7% dividend. This past week there has been a storm-the-battlements rally for certain tech companies; I suspect there will be some burnoff on them. Naturally, over time, well-run companies go up in value, but not on a straight line. 🤔 Free cash flow for VZ: https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/VZ/verizon/free-cash-flow I certainly wouldn’t buy VZ for capital appreciation, but it is rock solid for a 7% dividend—at a time when it is tough to get even 4% on a cd or bond (not to mention the likely hood that interest rates will drop further in the coming year). Capital appreciation due to falling interest rates isn’t unlikely, but would be a short-lived phenomenon. VZ could become a trap regardless, as direct-to-satellite builds out over the next few years. Fatter dividends are available elsewhere among various capital mgmt outfits, but they are interest rate sensitive and are not immune to economic fluctuations. Jim Cramer is an idiot. He gets on my nerves (typical NBC politics), but he’s no idiot. Is there an ETF that trades based on following insiders? You can’t simply buy a stock that insiders buy, because you would also have to track when they sell. They might not buy & hold. An ETF is probably the best way to ride the tech tsunami that’s been going on, assuming it has a track record of good performance. Years ago a financial journalist had a piece in one of the mags back then. He looked at the best performaing mutual funds (ETFs are kinda new to this old guy who types with my hands), then researched who the managers were, and found that the all best performing funds had been run by just a handful of the best managers. Even the middlin’ ones can keep track of a basket of stocks better than any one of us can. In “Beating the Street”, Peter Lynch suggested self-managed portfolios are probably best limited to just five stocks. Nanci Pelosi is the New Cathy Wood.
