President Donald Trump worked at warp speed to “Make America Great Again” in his first year back in office, and the results, on countless fronts, have been bountiful. Trump inherited from former President Joe Biden a country reeling from a wounded economy and porous border policies that led to mass illegal immigration and a globe facing destabilization with the advent of two major wars in the Middle East and Europe under his predecessor. On day one of his administration, January 20, 2025, Trump began to take sweeping action to address issues inherited from the Biden administration with 26 executive orders — a harbinger of the breakneck speed at which he would work to implement the MAGA agenda. In total, the Federal Register shows he signed 228 executive orders throughout the first full year of his second term — and that is without mentioning the transformative legislation he signed into law and highly successful foreign policy initiatives he embarked upon. “President Trump accomplished more in one year than many presidents did in eight. The President delivered on every major campaign promise — securing the border, stopping Biden’s inflation crisis, signing the largest middle-class tax cuts in history, ending woke DEI nonsense, and restoring American strength on the world stage,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Breitbart News on Monday. “Under President Trump’s leadership, America is safer, stronger, and more prosperous than ever before, and the best is yet to come.” Trump implemented his wildly successful tariff policies that produced many positive outcomes without spiking inflation, defying critics who claimed it would, began to heal the American economy, secured the southern border, settled or de-escalated numerous conflicts around the globe through his “peace through strength” foreign policy agenda, secured significant tax relief for Americans through his One Big Beautiful Bill Act, protected America’s youth and women from radical leftist trans ideology, and unleashed his and Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy’s Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) agenda. Trade Deals On “Liberation Day,” April 2, 2025, Trump instituted his worldwide tariff policy, giving the United States tremendous leverage to negotiate trade and pharmaceutical deals, broker peace deals, and drive monumental investment into the United States after policies of his predecessors led U.S.-based manufacturing to flee to foreign countries. In other words, Trump’s tariff strategy has driven many of his second-term accomplishments. Trump came out with forceful reciprocal tariffs, including a 20 percent duty on goods from the European Union (EU), a ten percent tariff on the United Kingdom, a 24 percent rate on Japanese goods, a 46 percent tariff on Vietnam, a 32 percent tariff on Taiwan, and lofty duties on scores of other countries across the planet. The results on the trade deal front in the months that followed were profound, headlined by the historic deal he reached with the EU on July 27. During a joint press conference with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at Trump Turnberry in Scotland, the leaders announced the contours of the deal, which include the EU’s commitment to purchase $750 billion in American energy and to invest $600 billion in America on top of existing investments. Moreover, the EU agreed to pay a 15 percent tariff on goods from Europe to gain access to American markets, and Trump noted that European countries were opening their markets to American goods. Von der Leyen stressed that the deal was about rebalancing the EU’s trade surplus with the United States when asked about the concessions the U.S. would make. “The starting point was an imbalance, a surplus on our side and a deficit on the U.S. side, and we wanted to rebalance the trade relation, and we wanted to do it in a way that trade goes on between the two of us across the Atlantic, because the two biggest economies should have a good trade flow between us,” she said. “I think we hit exactly the point we wanted to find: Rebalance, but enable trade on both sides, which means good jobs on both sides of the Atlantic, means prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic, and that was important for us,” she added. Trump called the agreement “the biggest deal ever made.” In 2024 alone, the countries swapped €1.68 trillion, or roughly $1.8 trillion, in goods and services, accounting for nearly 30 percent of global trade and 43 percent of global gross domestic product. The EU deal marks the centerpiece of Trump’s trade progress as a result of tariffs, and followed deals with the United Kingdom, Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam. The trade bloc of these countries alone accounted for 57 percent of global GDP and 40 percent of international trade. Trump has also struck new trade agreements with Malaysia and Cambodia, finalized during his October Southeast Asia trip. Most-Favored-Nations Deals Trump’s tariffs are paying dividends for Americans through the Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) deals he has struck with leading pharmaceutical companies, which have drastically reduced drug prices. Trump told Breitbart News outside of Air Force One on August 3 — more than a month before he announced his first deal — that there would be “tremendous” drops in drug prices when asked if he had advice for Republicans ahead of midterm elections in 2026. “We’ll be dropping drug prices. It’ll start over the next two to three months, by 1,200, 1,300, and even 1,400 percent and 500 percent, but not just 50 percent or 25 percent, which normally would be a lot because the rest of the world pays much less for the identical drug,” he continued. “And we’re going to be paying the same thing. We’re going to have a Favored Nations. We will pay as low as the lowest nation in the world.” On September 30, he announced his first agreement with Pfizer, followed by deals with Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers Squibb, Boehringer Ingelheim, Eli Lilly, EMD Serono, Genentech, Gilead Sciences, GSK, Merck, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi through the end of the year. Trump’s deals are bringing prices down dramatically on a plethora of drugs, and his agreements with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly provide prime examples. Novo Nordisk-produced Ozempic and Wegovy are dropping to $350 per month in the United States, down from $1,000 and $1,350, respectively, while Eli Lilly-made GLP-1 drug Zepbound is falling to $346 per month from $1,086. Trump is now calling on Congress to codify the MFN deals in the “Great Healthcare Plan.” He told Breitbart News on Friday that he gave countries an ultimatum: either agree to MFN prices for America or face tariffs. “We’re doing that by most-favored nations and other nations, whoever pays the lowest in the world, that’s what we’re going to pay. Right now, we’re paying sometimes ten times higher than other nations. So, we have favored nations, that’s been approved. Other nations have, for the most part, agreed to it, and they had no choice. Otherwise, we were going to put tariffs on them,” he said before taking off on Marine One en route to Palm Beach, Florida, for the weekend. Investments In large part thanks to Trump’s tariffs and deregulation, he has attracted massive investment into the United States from countries and companies around the world, including drug companies as part of MFN deals. Trump puts the number at $18 trillion in investment in just one year, while the White House lists $9.6 trillion in investments on its website, with some of the most consequential commitments being: “In four years of Biden, they secured less than $1 trillion of new investment in the United States … In less than one year, I have secured commitments for over $18 trillion from all over the world, the most ever for any country,” he told the Detroit Economic Club on Wednesday. Leverage for Peace The president has also wielded tariffs to secure peace agreements. He described to Fox News in October how his strategy helped yield a ceasefire or de-escalation in most of the conflicts he has settled around the world: “I think we top everybody by a lot with the tariffs and all of that. But, you know, having the ability to deal with trade, having the ability to use tariffs to help me make a point — the tariffs have brought peace to the world. I’m telling you, they brought peace to the world. And not only here, but with so many other deals. You know, I’ve made seven peace deals where countries were in many cases, 30, 31 years, 135, 137 years they’ve been fighting and millions of people being killed. And I brought peace. And I did it through — in not all cases, but probably in at least five of the seven that we’ve done so far, it was through trade. That we’re not going to deal with people that fight. We’re not going to deal, and we’re going to put tariffs on you. We’re not going to let you deal in the United States. We’ll put tariffs on you.” “And without that, without the tariffs — I mean, far more than even the money that we’re taking in, which is trillions of dollars, essentially trillions of dollars,” he continued. “Far much — more importantly, it gives you a tremendous road to peace and the saving of millions of lives, just millions and millions of lives. You look at India and Pakistan. I said, ‘Well, we’re not going to do business with either of you if you don’t — if you don’t put it together.’ These are two nuclear nations that were — seven planes were shot down as you know, and they were really at it. They were going at it, and I said, ‘We’re not going to do any business with you. We’re not going to have anything to do with you. We’re going to put massive tariffs on you, both — in both cases.’ And they said, ‘Well, we got to start talking about this. This is tremendous amounts of money and power we’re dealing with.’” Trump added, “And within 24 hours, I had a peace deal. They made — they stopped. They stopped the fighting. And we can go one after another. You’ve been really nice enough to announce all of the deals, but there have been many deals. And a lot of them — a lot of the settlements were based on trade.” Speaking at the Ford facility in Dearborn, Michigan, last Tuesday, Trump touted that his “economic boom” is underway. The data from a full year in office backs it up. The Atlanta Fed projects the Trump economy grew at 5.3 percent GDP in the fourth quarter — an extremely robust number despite likely being hindered by the 43-day Democrat government shutdown in the fall. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett predicted in November that the Democrat shutdown was costing the United States $15 billion per week and would drop fourth-quarter GDP growth by one percent to 1.5 percent. Based on Hassett’s comments, the highly impressive fourth-quarter projection would presumably be even higher if there were no shutdown. This immense growth comes on the heels of a third quarter in which GDP “rose at a seasonally and inflation-adjusted 4.3 percent annual rate,” as Breitbart News noted. The substantial GDP figures come as Trump has halted Biden-era inflation while overseeing rising wages for workers, giving Americans more buying power with their dollar. Over the last three months, core inflation registered at just 1.6 percent, the president said last week — a welcome reprieve after runaway inflation under Biden at levels unseen since the Jimmy Carter administration in the late 1970s. Per White House data, while Biden’s policies led to a 22 percent increase in car prices, a 37 percent rise in hotel rates, a 32 percent jump in airfare, and a 31 percent increase in gasoline prices, Trump, as of late December, had presided over price decreases across all such categories. Wages under Biden for the typical private-sector worker dwindled $2,919 on average, according to White House data. In contrast, wages climbed $1,048 for the typical private-sector worker in just 11 months under Trump. Blue-collar workers are seeing particularly significant boosts. Factory worker wages were up $1,300, construction worker wages climbed $1,826, and miners’ wages soared by $3,336 from January into December. “For the first time in years, wages are rising much faster than inflation,” Trump said in a December address to the nation. The stock market has repeatedly hit all-time highs under the 47th president. White House data states the S&P reached 37 record highs in 2025, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average broke records 18 times. On New Year’s Day, Breitbart News Texas’s Bob Price and Randy Clark exclusively reported that “the Trump administration’s border team closed out [2025] with a historically low apprehension rate of less than 109,000 illegal aliens” for the year. The figure, which includes approximately 6,400 apprehensions along the southern border in December, underscores the effectiveness of the Trump administration’s border crackdown after policies of the Biden administration, including catch-and-release, allowed for historic illegal immigration. “Once again, we have a record low number of encounters at the border and the 7th straight month of zero releases. Month after month, we are delivering results that were once thought impossible: the most secure border in history and unmatched enforcement successes,” said Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem in a statement released in early December. “Thanks to President Trump’s leadership and the dedication of DHS law enforcement, America’s borders are safer than ever before.” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Breitbart News Texas that in under one year, “President Trump has delivered some of the most historic and consequential achievements in presidential history — and this Administration is just getting started.” “Under President Trump’s leadership, we are making America safe again and putting the American people first,” McLaughlin added. “In record-time we have secured the border, taken the fight to cartels, and arrested thousands upon thousands of criminal illegal aliens.” Border crossings throughout 2025 dropped a staggering 93 percent, and 130,000 feet of temporary barriers were erected, according to the DHS, while the construction of the rest of Trump’s border wall is underway as commissioned through the One Big Beautiful Bill. The DHS removed over 622,000 illegal aliens in 2025 alone. The removals are in addition to 1.9 million illegal aliens who had self-deported as of December. Trump has settled or de-escalated eight conflicts or wars around the globe since returning to office, led by his historic Middle East peace deal to stop the war between Israel and Hamas, which began after Hamas’s brutal October 7, 2023, terrorist attacks. The president announced in a Truth Social post on October 8 that Hamas had agreed to his framework for a 20-point peace deal to end the war, including releasing all living and deceased hostages. Within days, the president jetted off to the Middle East to speak at the Knesset in Israel on October 13. Hamas released all 20 remaining living hostages on October 13. As of December 4, the remains of one deceased hostage, Ran Gvili, had not been returned, according to the American Jewish Committee. Trump, along with Arab leaders in the region, participated in a “Peace in the Middle East” signing ceremony in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, hours after he spoke at the Knesset. “So together, let us continue in the spirit of cooperation and goodwill that has finally brought us to this incredible, historic breakthrough,” Trump said at a press conference with world leaders following the signing ceremony. “If we do, together we will reach the Middle East’s incredible destiny — a safe and prosperous and beautiful crossroads of culture and commerce, faith in humanity, and geographic center,” he added. “This will be the geographic center of the world.” On December 4, Trump signed another historic peace agreement, brokered by his administration, between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of Rwanda at the recently renamed Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace in Washington, DC. The agreement marked the end of three decades of conflict between the two countries. “In this holy season we prepare to celebrate the birth of the Prince of Peace, we have come to the U.S. Institute of Peace, to sign a historic agreement that will end one of the longest-running conflicts anywhere in the world, with far more than ten million people killed,” Trump said. “Today, we commit to stopping decades of violence and bloodshed and to begin a new era of harmony and cooperation between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda,” he added. “I want to thank the two courageous leaders. They are courageous leaders.” These are just two of many conflicts or wars Trump helped end since returning to office. He has also quelled disputes between Armenia and Azerbaijan, India and Pakistan, Thailand and Cambodia, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Iran and Israel. A ceasefire to end “The 12 Day War” between Israel and Iran came days after the United States carried out operation “Midnight Hammer” to neutralize Iran’s nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. Trump and his administration also halted what could have been an escalation between Serbia and Kosovo, Turkish media reported. Trump’s foreign policy footprint continued to grow to start 2026, with operation “Absolute Resolve” on January 3, in which the United States captured former Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro, without a casualty of U.S. servicemembers or loss of any U.S. equipment. “We’re going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition. We don’t want to be involved with having somebody else get in, and we have the same situation that we had for the last long period of years,” Trump said in a press conference after the operation. Trump’s efforts on the foreign policy front earned him the Inaugural FIFA Peace Prize in December during the World Cup draw at the Trump-Kennedy Center. Trump shared that the peace prize is “truly one of the great honors of my life,” and “beyond awards … we saved millions and millions of lives.” During his meeting with anti-socialist Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado last week, Machado presented him with her 2025 Nobel Peace Prize “In Gratitude for [his] Extraordinary Leadership in Promoting Peace through Strength, Advancing Diplomacy, and Defending Liberty and Prosperity.” Another shining achievement of Trump’s — and hands down the biggest on the legislative front — was the passage and signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. To date, the bill serves as Trump’s legacy legislation, making permanent the 2017 Trump tax cuts and implementing significant tax deductions for tipped and overtime workers, as promised in his 2024 campaign policy proposal. Waiters, bartenders, casino dealers, and other tipped workers can deduct up to $25,000 on their tipped income starting this tax season, while overtime workers can use up to a $12,500 deduction. The House Ways and Means Committee projects that Americans could get $191 billion in net new tax relief this year, with filers potentially seeing an additional $1,000 on their tax refunds coming this spring. “Millions of Americans will see the working families’ tax cuts put more money in their pockets when they file taxes this coming spring. In our tax relief bill, Republicans wasted no time and ensured that we cut taxes on income earned this year. Americans voted to have more money in their wallet, and that’s exactly what President Trump and Republicans delivered,” Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith (R-MO) said in November. “Tax refunds are a big deal for a lot of American families. It covers home repairs, health care, or summer vacations; all of which became completely unaffordable under Joe Biden. Thanks to the working families tax cuts, more Americans will have greater financial security and ability to provide for their future,” he added. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act allows a maximum annual tax deduction of $10,000 for interest paid on loans for vehicles that were assembled in the United States, as long as the filer has a modified adjusted gross income of less than $100,000 or less than $200,000 for joint filers. Beyond tax cuts, the law delivers on border security by commissioning the completion of Trump’s border wall, funding mass deportation operations, and establishing the Trump investment accounts for America’s youth, with a $1,000 seed investment from the Treasury for U.S. citizens born from 2025 to 2028. Trump has taken substantial steps throughout his second term to protect women and children from radical left-wing transgender ideology. In February 2025, he signed an executive order to protect women’s sports from male participants. “With this executive order, the war on women’s sports is over,” he said at the signing. As Breitbart News reported: The order contains several measures, the first of which is to re-write federal Title IX education rules to withhold federal funds from schools that allow transgender athletes to play as females. Another aspect of the order would charge the Department of Homeland Security with the task of denying visas to foreign trans athletes who want to enter the U.S. to compete among women. After signing the order, Trump cited the importance of female athletes and their role in the 2028 Olympics, which are scheduled for Los Angeles. He also mentioned the World Cup. “My administration will not stand by and watch men beat and batter female athletes. We’re just not going to let it happen,” the president said. Several members of the Save Women’s Sports community, including former NCAA swimming champion Riley Gaines, witnessed the signing. Just over a week after he took office in January 2025, Trump signed an executive order to ban “chemical or surgical mutilation” sex-change procedures for minors. “Accordingly, it is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called ‘transition’ of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures,” the order reads. The implementation of Trump and Kennedy’s MAHA agenda is well underway, with the latest moves including the new, inverted food pyramid and the return of whole and two percent milk to America’s schools. The White House unveiled reformed dietary guidelines for Americans on January 7 at a White House press briefing with Kennedy, Food and Drug Administration chief Dr. Marty Makary, and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz. The guidelines promote a diet rich in protein, healthy fats, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and dairy. “Today marks a decisive change in federal nutrition policy made possible by President Trump’s leadership and the work of MAHA moms and public health advocates who demanded reform,” Kennedy said. “These guidelines replace corporate-driven assumptions with common-sense goals and gold-standard scientific integrity. These new guidelines will revolutionize our nation’s food culture and make America healthy again,” he added. Makary said that “a corrupt food pyramid” had been pushed on Americans for decades, focusing on “demonizing natural, healthy saturated fats, telling you not to eat eggs and steak, and ignoring a giant blind spot: refined carbohydrates, added sugars, ultra-processed food.” He added that most children are consuming a diet including “ultra-processed food,” which he called an “epidemic.” “We have 40 percent of our kids now with a chronic disease. It is not their fault. This is something that is the result of bad advice from the government and a medical establishment that for decades peddled research from a flawed 1960s model,” Makary added. Days later, Trump signed the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act to once again make whole and two percent milk available in America’s schools, after they were virtually banned by the Obama-era Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. In early December, Trump ordered a review of the U.S. childhood vaccine schedule in concert with peer nations such as Japan, Denmark, and Germany, which recommend fewer vaccines for children than the U.S. schedule. He directed aligning the U.S. schedule with peer nations if their schedules were deemed superior in the review. While the U.S. has recommended 18 vaccines for children, Denmark recommends ten, Japan 14, and Germany 15. As HHS noted on January 5: After consulting with health ministries of peer nations, considering the assessment’s findings, and reviewing the decision memo presented by National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, Food and Drug Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary, and CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz, Acting Director O’Neill formally accepted the recommendations and directed the CDC to move forward with implementation. … The assessment reviewed 20 peer, developed nations and found that the U.S. is a global outlier among developed nations in both the number of diseases addressed in its routine childhood vaccination schedule and the total number of recommended doses but does not have higher vaccination rates than such countries. In fact, many peer nations that recommend fewer routine vaccines achieve strong child health outcomes and maintain high vaccination rates through public trust and education rather than mandates. For example, in 2024, the U.S. recommended more childhood vaccines than any peer nation, and more than twice as many doses as some European nations. The updated schedule “Recommends all vaccines for which there is consensus among peer nations.” Trump’s bounty of accomplishments does not end there. As Leavitt noted, he has rooted out Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies from the federal government, and according to Axios, was on track to oversee “the largest one-year drop in murders the nation has ever recorded” as of late December.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: Consolidation in a ‘Hunger Games scenario’ – and a true loss for the industry

This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → It’s January, and (as per…) the social feeds of most media practitioners are awash with predictions of how the industry will pan out in the coming calendar year. Many such missives are indistinguishable from the next, but among the platitudinous musings, last week’s 2026 outlook presentation from Arete Research stood out, complete with signature-style hot takes from the firm’s noted analysts Richard Kramer and Rocco Strauss. The Hunger Games First off, on a compliance note, the below does not constitute investment advice, with the whirlwind January 15 presentation exploring anomalies in the marketplace, all of which are likely to result in a Hunger Games-style scenario over the next 12 months, per the duo. All this takes place within the context of the media industry’s “Big Three” – Google, Meta, and Amazon – all of whom absorbed even more ad spend than earlier expected in 2025. “We are struggling to see from where in the economy we’re finding these incremental pools of spend,” observed Kramer, noting how this results in “Hunger Games competition.” Indeed, fellow presenter Strauss separately outlined his opinion on how the “Hunger Games scenario” will likely play out with media agencies, as holding companies “don’t have much more to give.” Of course, all this happens within the context of the AI arms race – Arete’s Kramer pointed out that the 2026 chapter of this era would see a move from “automation to action” in the rush to launch agentic offerings. He further observed the resulting “spaghetti junction of partnerships” in this rush, as demonstrated by last week’s tie-up between Apple and Google to power the latest version of Siri. “Distribution really wins in tech, and Google here seems to be in the poll position,” observed Kramer. “They have multiple billion-user properties of their own, they have captured end-point distribution with Apple… the Walled Gardens [continue to] play gatekeepers.” A ‘tale of woe’ & consolidation It won’t be news to Digiday readers that many independent ad tech companies listed on public markets had a difficult 2025, with this cohort’s talisman, The Trade Desk, seeing its stock price fall 70%. “It was a tale of woe,” observed Kramer, noting how of the near-dozen companies within this cohort, only Taboola and Zeta Global were in positive territory, with pretty much the entire category underperforming the S&P 500. It’s this downward pressure, including the need for ad tech companies to find new revenue streams and manage the risks of disruption as ad spend on the open web declines, that’s likely to lead to further consolidation within this cohort. Arete’s analyst duo noted that many developments in this sector of the ad industry will hinge on the outcome of Google’s antitrust cases. Of course, independent ad tech can’t bet its collective future on the defenestration of Google Ad Manager, as evidenced by the growth of Amazon’s demand-side platform – a dynamic likely contributing to the precipitous decline in the stock price of other DSPs – with Arete Research predicting consolidation to gather pace. “Many ad tech companies seem to be for sale right now, or looking to huddle together… this is going to accelerate in 2026,” observed Kramer, who later went on to note, “with the open web, shrinking the space for traditional SSP and DSP buying [ad space] at open web is a reducing market.” As to the potential nature of such exits? Strauss referenced speculation that Criteo may be up for sale, noting that entities such as OpenAI, PayPal, and Shopify are likely interested in assets as they seek to expand their revenue streams. Strauss again emphasized that such observations are not investment advice, although he pointed to Amazon as a blueprint for potential new market entrants. “It took Amazon a good four years to build that stuff, to hire the team, to build it, to have a proper data[set] and so on,” he added. The full presentation can be accessed via here. Elsewhere last week, the tragic death of OpenX CEO John Gentry emerged, with the breadth and depth of tributes to him serving as testament to the high regard in which he was held. Insights from the IPA Bellwether Q4 ’25: The EC further pushes to rein-in Google’s ad tech monopoly The European Commission published provisional findings on Google’s ad tech stack, ruling that its wares (primarily AdX and DoubleClick for Publishers) have been dominant for more than a decade, further recommending billions in financial penalties, with a forced divestiture also in prospect. ‘We don’t care if you don’t use our UX anymore’: Yahoo recasts its DSP as a data backbone for the agentic world Yahoo is intentionally making its demand-side platform (DSP) less sticky. “A big reason everyone wants agentic to happen is to make DSPs go away.” — One anonymous source opines on the subtext for the development of AdCP, etc. Ad tech’s Hunger Games are real… Advertising group Dentsu’s push to sell global unit close to collapse The Financial Times reports that private equity groups are turning their noses up at the international arm of the Japanese ad juggernaut. A Google VP explains why ads make sense in AI search but not Gemini — yet With Google’s Gemini surging in popularity, speculation has been bubbling in the ad industry that the app might be on the cusp of introducing ads to capitalize on the moment — and help offset the hefty AI infrastructure costs. Google’s Dany Taylor explains more to BI’s Lara O’Reilly. Google’s agentic commerce plan is here — what marketers must knowGoogle has provided a blueprint for major brands, writes Ad Age’s Asa Hiken, showing them how to connect to its AI commerce ecosystem that attempts to automate everything from shopping to pizza delivery. However, there are challenges for marketers navigating this complex landscape as Google builds its agentic framework parallel to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. McClatchy Media accuses Google in federal court of monopolizing online ad sales It’s that company again. We think you get the idea by now… Advertising is coming to ChatGPT, but not fast enough to outrun incumbent platform giants — one in particular. The European Commission is probing the industry’s response to Google’s proposed behavioral remedies. The joint venture is involved in multiple pitches for businesses with a strong U.S. base and international aspirations, while visiting pitch consultants to make sure it’s part of the consideration set.

Title: California Billionaire Tax: Why Some Billionaires Are Planning Exits
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathangoldman/2026/01/19/california-billionaire-tax-why-some-billionaires-are-planning-exits/

ByNathan Goldman, Contributor. The 2026 Billionaire Tax Act has sent shockwaves across the U.S. This act is generally defined by its proposed one-time tax of five percent on California residents’ net worth if they have over $1 billion of wealth. There are clear theoretical arguments to be made for the bill’s passage as it would raise an estimated $100 billion for health care and educational needs. However, recent analysis suggests that design choices and the current wording of the act could have devastating legal and economic consequences, including some billionaires being taxed well beyond the proposed 5% rate. What follows summarizes the current state of the proposed California billionaire tax, the recent criticism of the act and the design choices that may need to be reconsidered before it is potentially put up to a vote. The 2026 Billionaire Tax Act was filed by Jim Mangia, president and CEO of St. John’s Community Health, and Suzanne Jimenez, who represents the SEIU-UHW health care union, in October of 2025. The act has since been put forth as formal legislation on Nov. 26, 2025, under the header of Initiative No. 25-0024. The act is currently collecting signatures to appear on the November 2026 election ballot. The 2026 Billionaire Tax Act enacts a 5% tax on the wealth of California residents who have accumulated over $1 billion in wealth. The tax is unusual because it is a tax on wealth, rather than income, and the tax would include payments related to unrealized gains. According to Forbes, this act would raise $100 billion from California’s 200 or more billionaires between 2027 and 2031 (assuming no taxpayer migration or successful legal challenges), and these funds would go to replenishing funding for California’s Medicaid and childhood education program. According to the bill, taxpayers’ wealth will be defined by “personal property and wealth, including shares of capital stock, bonds, or other evidences of indebtedness, and any legal or equitable interest therein.” Thus, the bill is taking the stance that all assets shall be considered when determining whether a taxpayer is a billionaire and subject to the wealth tax. The bill does allow a phase-in that will subject the taxpayer to the 5% tax fully once their wealth reaches $1.1 billion. Only a small amount of assets (up to $5 million) can be excluded from the taxpayer’s net worth when calculating their billionaire status and wealth tax liability owed. Even though the bill will not be voted on until November, the initiative proposes a retroactive effective date of Jan. 1, 2026, a feature likely to face legal challenge. As it is currently written, this retroactive application would subject California billionaires to the 5% wealth tax immediately. The proposal has already prompted significant responses among California billionaires. According to The New York Times, Peter Thiel and Larry Page have openly discussed leaving California due to this tax. Furthermore, Fox Business reports that real estate broker Julian Johnston is working directly with three billionaires about moving from California to South Florida due to this billionaire wealth tax. California already imposes the highest and most progressive income tax rate in the U.S., with a top marginal tax rate of 13.3% on income over $1 million. This billionaire wealth tax would represent an incremental tax on high-net-worth taxpayers in addition to the already high taxes that they pay, leading to possible perceived inequity over this tax. However, not all California billionaires are opposed to this plan. According to CNBC, Nvidia’s Jensen Huang has said that the additional taxes owed (a reported $7.75 billion) is “perfectly fine” with him. While this news is promising, it needs to be taken with caution for two reasons. First, even if some California billionaires pay the wealth tax, if a significant number do not and challenge paying it, California may lose out on those tax revenues both for the wealth tax and in the future. Second, just because a billionaire says they will support this does not mean that they actually will. In fact, just 2½ years ago, Jeff Bezos supported Washington’s proposed billionaire tax. According to the Tax Foundation, he then announced a move to Miami, Florida, shortly before its passage, allowing him to forgo paying any wealth tax and upending the legislation’s potential. Potentially the biggest criticism of this legislation is not from the billionaires themselves, but, instead, from the state’s current governor, Gavin Newsom. According to the Los Angeles Times, Newsom strongly opposes this ballot measure, saying that it is badly drafted and will not end up aiding the essential state services it is geared toward. Given Newsom’s prominent role in both the state and the nationwide Democratic Party, his opposition likely carries a lot of weight among potential voters this November. In theory, funding health care and education needs by asking billionaires to contribute a small percentage of their wealth may seem like a popular and plausible path toward addressing a key problem in California. However, there have already been numerous issues raised with this plan. For instance, Baker Botts highlights issues like the Dormant Commerce Clause lead to a failure of the Complete Auto Test because worldwide assets would be subject to a California tax. This article also highlights numerous legal concerns associated with the retroactive nature of the legislation, the legislation being aimed at single out specific individuals (Bill of Attainder), the Uniformity Clause of the California Constitution, among other things. The Tax Foundation highlights that, as a function of design issues and potential drafting errors, the 5% wealth tax is actually much larger than that. In particular, a billionaire’s valuation is based on voting interests. The article uses Tony Xu, the founder of DoorDash, as an example. Xu owns 2.6% of the company but controls 57.6% of the vote. In this example, Xu has a $2.41 billion net worth based on his ownership in the company. However, as a consequence of the bill as currently written, Xu’s wealth tax consequence would be $4.17 billion, or 173% of his company ownership. The Tax Foundation highlights five other California billionaires whose tax liability would be well over the 5% being advertised, including David Baszucki (Roblox), Sergey Brin (Alphabet), Larry Page (Alphabet), Mark Zuckerberg (Meta), and Jensen Huang (Nvidia). This raises questions about whether affected taxpayers would remain in California due to the unusually high wealth tax rate they would be facing. Other considerations raised by the article are that the levying of the tax might force billionaires to sell a large number of their shares (potentially tanking the stock price and causing other financial issues), the assessment rules for private businesses might result in them being overvalued, large penalties for understating liabilities, unusual language defining anti-tax avoidance measures, and a substantial tax that can be assigned to taxpayers that get married or divorced. While the proposed California billionaire tax is still far from a reality, both the potential benefits and consequences have become increasingly apparent. Should billionaires decide to depart California, they will still be liable for paying the wealth tax if the bill is passed. However, whether and under what circumstances this tax is challenged in court, upheld, and collected is a completely different story. Thus, California lawmakers and taxpayers must carefully balance the costs and benefits of attempting to levy such a tax on its 200 billionaires given the uncertainty in the outcomes.

Tara Turk-Haynes hired yoga instructors and meditation gurus to help employees handle burnout at the media company where she worked. She's not doing anything like that today. Wellness perks are no longer "a thing," said Turk-Haynes, now an independent HR consultant in Los Angeles. "Attracting and retaining talent is not a business challenge right now." The white-collar workplace has gotten a lot less cuddly in the past few years, as the economic bargain between employers and employees has been redefined. Perks have vanished, in-office mandates are on the rise, and layoffs continue even as profits hold up — changes that reflect a system that prioritizes shareholder returns over stakeholder capitalism and corporate loyalty. With job openings thinning, wages struggling to keep pace with inflation, and AI looming as a threat to entire occupations, the recalibration is altering how advancement and compensation are determined inside companies — a new reality that some workers view as destabilizing, and others see as a long-overdue reset. "When COVID happened, there was a shift in power from employers to employees with the Great Resignation," said Jessica Kriegel, chief strategy officer at workplace consulting firm Culture Partners in Sacramento, Calif. "The pendulum swung really far. Now it's swinging back." This story is part of Business Insider's series "The Future of Capitalism," which looks at ways Americans' confidence in capitalism has been eroding and what related changes in our economy mean for your work and wealth. Earlier this month, Meta began rolling out a new employee evaluation program that ties career advancement and financial rewards to measurable impact, while Citi CEO Jane Fraser issued a memo saying she expects higher performance this year and to see "the last vestiges of old, bad habits fall away."

In August, AT&T's John Stankey told managers the company had moved away from a tenure-based "employment deal" toward one "focused on rewarding capability, contribution, and commitment." Meanwhile, some CEOs, particularly those aligned with the Trump administration, have become more outspoken about their political views, suggesting diminished concern about alienating talent. In November, Palantir CEO Alex Karp told analysts on an earnings call that his software company is the first "to be completely anti-woke." The shift toward a more explicitly capitalistic workplace is taking hold even as leaders across the political spectrum are championing increased government involvement in private enterprise. The US, for example, has recently taken equity stakes in about a dozen private companies—an unusual expansion of direct federal ownership in the private sector. Now, even though the economy is relatively healthy, most employers are planning to trim or maintain head count this year, survey data show, while white-collar workers are job-hugging and bracing for more layoffs. "There is pressure on CEOs from investors and shareholders to continue to grow," said Kriegel. "And that pressure is getting pushed down onto employees." The current moment stands apart, though it's not the first time the pendulum has shifted toward employers. The dot-com bust in the early 2000s and the global financial crisis from 2007 to 2009 also cooled hiring. Both events, however, coincided with steep stock market declines, whereas the post-pandemic period has been marked by generally strong results on Wall Street. "The stock market's doing well, record-setting, and yet companies are squeezing their employees," said Peter Cappelli, professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. The rise of AI has also posed a new existential threat to workers. Many employers see the potential for the technology to replace human talent through automation, and some have cited AI directly or indirectly as a reason for layoffs. "Before asking for more headcount and resources, teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI," wrote Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke in an April memo to the company's employees. To be sure, employers' labor costs — typically their largest expense — are on the rise. For one, the average price of employer-sponsored health insurance in the US is expected to increase 6.7% this year, up from 4.5% in 2024, according to consulting firm Mercer. Businesses have also incurred a new expense: AI investments, including chatbot licenses and employee training. Research firm IDC forecasts that US-based firms will spend roughly $320 billion on AI hardware, software, and services this year. Those costs come as corporate leaders are navigating what they describe as a shakier economic environment. Mentions of "economic uncertainty" on US public company earnings calls more than doubled in 2025 compared with the prior year, according to market-intelligence platform AlphaSense. Employment experts say the uncertainty helps explain why the job market has been stuck in a low-hire, low-fire state. Even as large companies such as Starbucks, Southwest Airlines, and Disney announced massive layoffs last year, the overall rate of layoffs and discharges stayed below historical norms, Labor Department data show. The result is a labor market full of contradictions, said Nicole Bachaud, an economist at ZipRecruiter. "That's why it feels so weird," she said. The unemployment rate finished last year at 4.4%, near historic lows. Still, many professionals lack confidence in the job market as career opportunities in once-reliable sectors, such as technology and the federal government, have thinned. "Psychologically, it's damaging," said Lars Schmidt, a recruiting executive in the Washington, D.C., area. In industries where jobs were plentiful, workers generally knew how long it would take to find a new position if they craved change. Now, "most people don't have any safe prediction of what that may be," Schmidt said. Another drag on confidence is the bleak employment outlook. A recent survey of US CEOs by the Yale School of Management shows that nearly two-thirds plan to maintain or reduce head count in 2026. Further, average annual pay increases are forecast to remain flat in 2026, despite continued high inflation and after shrinking in recent years, according to Mercer. These factors may help explain why workers feel economically insecure. Nearly a third of Americans expect their finances to worsen this year, according to a December survey by Bankrate. That is the highest level of pessimism since 2018, when the personal-finance site began asking consumers about their financial outlook. Against that backdrop, workers are increasingly reluctant to quit. The US quit rate has fallen below pre-pandemic norms, federal data show, even as more employers mandate five days in the office and track workers' hours and AI usage. All of this leaves workers with little appetite for pushback, said Jeff LeBlanc, a management lecturer at Bentley University. "You're not going to see a big revolt," he said. "I don't think people have it in them right now." Though the overall job market forecast is gloomy, there are some bright spots for workers. Demand is robust for people who can build out AI applications across industries, said Aditya Challapally, who teaches a course for Stanford Online about generative AI. "This is a small, but rapidly growing niche," he said. AI fluency can help just about anyone get ahead in their career, added Challapally. Workers who understand AI are "able to move faster, make better decisions, and take on higher-leverage work," he said. Hiring is also strong in healthcare, social assistance, and leisure and hospitality, according to recent data from the US Labor Department. Laura Ullrich, director of economic research at job site Indeed, expects the overall labor market to improve as long as the economy continues to grow. "This low-hire, low-fire environment cannot last forever," she said. "At some point, companies will need to start hiring more." In the meantime, some workers are regaining a sense of control by taking on freelance or contract gigs that they could parley into full-time work should they get laid off. Others are starting their own businesses, tapping AI tools to get up and running quickly. Adopting a side hustle is safer than quitting a job and launching a search for a new one right now because the market is just so competitive, said John Ferguson, an HR consultant and former chief human resources officer at NASCAR. "If you don't have the next opportunity lined up, I encourage you to stay where you are," he said. "But also plan your exit strategy." Jump to

Here's your firmware update for January 16, 2026 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. This week, Meta turned its back on VR, and Apple caved to Google in its hunt for an AI update for Siri. To catch up on these and the other seven biggest tech news stories of the week, scroll down to see our recaps of the big things that happened. When you're done, check out the seven new movies and TV shows to watch this weekend. It hasn’t been a great time for drone fans in the US, with the FCC recently banning the sale of new, foreign-made drones – and a separate proposal from the US Department of Commerce taking aim at all Chinese drone imports (including existing models that have already been launched). Well, fortunately, a U-turn from the latter has removed that particular restriction from the equation for now. That means that stock of previously approved drones like the DJI Mavic 3 Pro and the Antigravity A1 can still be legally imported into the US. Still, with the FCC effectively banning the sale of foreign-made drones that it hasn’t approved (in other words, all new models), the future still looks bleak for Stateside drone fans. We got our first look at Sophie Turner as filming on Amazon’s Tomb Raider TV show begins, and the recreation of the character’s iconic video game look is perfect, highlighting to fans of the games how seriously Amazon is taking this adaptation. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Obviously, this is just a still of Turner in her costume, but she is undeniably Lara Croft in it, and if similar care and attention has been paid to the rest of the cast (which includes Jason Isaacs, Sigourney Weaver, and Martin Bobb-Semple, among others) as well as the show’s story, we could be in for a real treat. No release date has been given yet, but we can’t rule out a mid- to late 2026 launch. Over the past few weeks, Spotify Premium subscribers have been encountering AI-generated music recommendations in their Discover Weekly and Release Radar playlists, prompting the music platform to introduce labels to identify AI-generated music in a monster Reddit thread. According to users who have experienced this, the issue with AI music on Spotify is only getting worse; the problem doesn’t lie with AI music itself, but with the deception on Spotify’s part, which is what’s getting under people’s skin. This has led many paying users to think it’s part of a wider, secret business plan and that Spotify is deliberately doing this to avoid paying artists further. In other news, Spotify has also raised subscription prices for US members, affecting all tiers. It marks the third price increase since 2023, which many people are attributing to the maintenance of Spotify Lossless. This week, Meta seemed to give up on VR as it slashed Reality Labs jobs, including closing down several VR game studios, and ending updates for the excellent VR fitness platform Supernatural. The news is a tragedy for fans of the Meta Quest system as it suggests Meta’s future support for its headsets will be at least a little lackluster, and Hamish Hector argued that, as things stand, he’s only interested in the Steam Frame. It’s no secret Reality Labs has been hemorrhaging funds for some time, but this major about-turn from Meta might lead some to wonder if you can trust the company not to change course again if its new AI glasses focus starts to go awry. Google has just dropped "Personal Intelligence" for Gemini, and it might be the most significant leap for AI assistants yet. This upgrade allows Gemini to securely tap into your personal Google ecosystem (Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube) to provide deep, individualized context for your queries. The capabilities are genuinely impressive: imagine Gemini diagnosing a car issue by checking your Gmail purchase history for the model, scanning your Photos for service records, and pulling DIY solutions from YouTube. It’s the "true" AI assistant we’ve been waiting for. Interestingly, given the newly announced Apple-Google AI partnership, this looks like a sneak peek at how the next-gen Siri might function in iOS 27. Apple got served a huge slice of humble pie this week, as it conceded Ai supremacy to Google announcing that Siri’ s next-gen version will be backed by Gemini. A lot of questions remain, but in a joint statement Apple and Google revealed “These [Gemini] models will help power future Apple Intelligence features, including a more personalized Siri coming this year.”Apple first unveiled its plans to launch an AI-upgraded Siri during WWDC 2024 but almost two years later we’re still waiting for the upgrade. The company has since promised a Spring 2026 launch, and with Google Gemini it might finally make that happen. Well, we have officially had the first major outage of 2026, and it was a massive, nearly 8-hour outage that took out Verizon's cell service for customers across the United States on January 14, 2026. You can see our full reporting in the live blog linked below, but it was a serious, hours-long event that saw folks with Verizon swap 5G and network bars for SOS with no access to voice, text, and data across much of the country. Down Detector reports swelled around 12:30 PM ET, with Verizon confirming the issue at 1 PM, but many folks did not see any signs of recovery until closer to 8 PM ET that evening. The carrier didn't have the best communication during the event, with only a few statements that came hours apart. The day after the outage, Verizon confirmed each account would receive a single $20 credit, which, simply put, many customers were not pleased with. The carrier also confirmed to TechRadar that it was a software issue tied to a cyber incident.

Congress Just Loaded Up On These 2 Stocks! | 13:32 Dividendology | 241K subscribers | 157,468 views | January 13, 2026 Unusual Whales (Excerpt) Read more at youtube.com ... [transcript] Congressional Trading Report 2025 Unusual Whales, the website that tracks congressional trading, just released their full report on Congress trading in 2025. And essentially like every single year, especially since 2020, there are plenty of congressional members who way outperform the S&P 500, with multiple members of Congress even returning well over 50%. Now, while this report is for the full year 2025, we’ve already seen a couple of interesting trades as we head into 2026. So, in this video, we’re going to be looking at two stocks that members of Congress have been recently buying. To analyze these two stocks, we’re going to be using forecaster.biz, which you can check out at the link in the description. It’s a tool that I’ve started using more, and I like that you can easily overlay things like sales, net income, price to earnings, and dividends over the share price, so you can see correlation. But, let’s go ahead and dive in. Stock Analysis: Broadcom (AVGO) The first stock that members of Congress have been buying is Broadcom, stock ticker AVGO. Now, this is a stock that’s already a large position in Nancy Pelosi’s portfolio. It’s currently the second largest position. And as you might already know, Broadcom’s performance over the last 5 years has just been exceptional, up 673%. If we look at the last 3 years, they’re up about 500%, and in the last year alone, up 53.76%, making it one of the best performing stocks in the S&P 500. Now, of course, what’s interesting about this is if we overlay what’s gone on with the sales for this company in the last 5 years, you can see that the share price has essentially followed the sales growth of the business. And on top of this, they’ve continued to grow dividends at a very high rate. In fact, if we scroll down, we can see back just in 2017, they were paying out about 10 cents per share in dividends. And look, now it’s more than 6x at about 65 cents per share. Congressional Trading Insights Now, let’s talk about congressional trading for a moment. If we jump over to the political tab here on Forecaster, one of the things we will notice is there is already significant congressional buying in Q1 and Q2 of 2025. I mean, we’re talking about millions of dollars in some cases, but don’t point out Q3 and Q4. There is still significant congressional buying, especially more buying than selling. Now, when it comes to stocks like Broadcom, I see a lot of mixed reviews. Obviously, the stock has done unbelievably well in the last one, three, and five years. But look at what’s been going on with the PE multiple. The PE multiple has climbed extraordinarily high, especially in the last couple of years. In fact, if we look at the fundamentals tab, Forecaster’s listing the trailing 12 months PE multiple is about 70.37. There are very few stocks in the market with that high of a PE multiple. But it’s really important that we note a stock’s PE multiple by itself tells you absolutely nothing about the company without accounting for future growth rate projections. So for example, if we jump over to the raw data, look at revenue charted out over the past few years. Again, the stock price has followed the revenue growth. It’s followed the fundamental growth, and we can see based on the trailing 12 months, this growth is continuing into 2026. Now to be fair as it relates to Broadcom, it’s important we understand where this topline growth is actually coming from because it certainly hasn’t all been organic. This company has actually pursued a lot of acquisitions over the years, and most recently they acquired VMware, and that was just a couple of years ago when revenue was sitting at about 35.8 billion. So around right here is when they made that acquisition, and obviously since then revenue has jumped quite a bit. Growth Strategy and Financials So what we can see right now is they’re pretty much pursuing growth at all costs. Let me show you an example of what I mean. If we scroll down all the way to the bottom of the income statement, look at what’s happened to average shares outstanding. We can see they’ve actually issued more shares outstanding over the past decade. Why is that the case? Typically, in most instances, that’s not something we want to see. But the reality is at certain time periods, it can actually be a good thing. If a company can issue new shares when they’re trading at an undervaluation, yes, it still dilutes shareholders, but with the capital that they raise, if they can get a very good return on investment from that capital, it can still actually be beneficial to shareholders. So, yes, they’ve been issuing new shares. On top of this, look at what’s been going on on the balance sheet. If we scroll down and look at net debt again, what do you notice? Net debt has actually grown quite a bit for this company in the last few years. They are aggressively pursuing growth. And so the ultimate measure of whether or not this is actually paying off is by looking at what’s actually going on with free cash flow. Remember, a company has five options with free cash flow. They can reinvest back into the business, pay down debt, attempt mergers and acquisitions, buy back shares, and pay out dividends. And like we saw, Broadcom has rapidly grown dividends over the last few years. So free cash flow has grown at a very high rate. We can see in 2024 they were sitting at about 19.4. Looks like trailing 12 months. They’re already sitting at 26.9. And growth, whether you’re looking at earnings or free cash flow, is expected to continue for Broadcom, especially at a high rate. Take a look at this. If we look at Broadcom and look at the average expected earnings growth over the next few years, 2026 EPS growth should be at about 50%, 2027 nearly 40%, and 2028 around 25%. This is some of the fastest earnings growth that you’ll see out of any company in the S&P 500. Valuation Considerations And so all that to say, yes, the PE multiple like we’ve seen on Forecaster looks extremely high at 70.37, but when you start to look at forward-looking PE multiples and account for that future earnings growth, it doesn’t look nearly as bad as you would think. This is why in a lot of instances, we actually want to look at the price to earnings growth multiple. Now, we’ll come back and talk about valuation in just a moment, but make sure you understand that Broadcom is not just another semiconductor company. Yes, Semiconductor Solutions is about 61% of revenue, and this is what a lot of people focus on because their products are used by companies like Google, Meta, and Anthropic. And the company already has a $73 billion backlog. That’s right, $73 billion in backlog. So essentially, if we go back and look at topline revenue, we can see in 2024, it was 51.57 billion. Their management has stated they already have 73 billion in backlog for the next 18 months. So these earnings and revenue growth projections we’ve been talking about aren’t something that analysts are pulling out of thin air. These are projections that are based on the reality of the orders that are coming in for Broadcom. That should give you more confidence in the stock. But then the other sector of the business is infrastructure software, and this is where they have made some acquisitions. But the good news is this portion of the business has extremely high margins and recurring revenue characteristics. So is it too late to buy Broadcom, or is there still potential opportunity? Well, here’s where things get interesting. Let’s assume for this stock that the PE multiple gets reduced drastically in the coming years. Maybe it falls all the way down to about 35. So essentially, the PE multiple is going to get cut in half. Let’s also assume they’re able to meet earnings growth projections and that by the year 2028, estimated EPS will be sitting at about $17.60, meaning that earnings would have to grow at a rate of around 37.5% through the year 2028. Well, here’s what we can see. All of a sudden, if EPS by 2028 is about $17.54, which is actually slightly below the average analyst estimate, you’d still be looking at a compounded annual return of 15.41%, not including the dividends. And the dividend yield is low; it’s only sitting at about 0.7%, but again, dividend growth has been exceptional. So that gives you a return of around 77%, again not including dividends, likely closer to 80% when you include dividends. So this is a great example. We have to reframe the way we think about valuation because yes, this PE multiple looks absurd at first glance, but when you consider the earnings growth projections that are actually being determined by the company’s backlog, all of a sudden the valuation doesn’t look as extreme as it would seem. And again, I think this is one of the many reasons that we’re seeing congressional members continuing to add Broadcom to their portfolio even though it performed so well in the last year after they already loaded up. Verizon Communications Stock Analysis And the second stock on our list is an interesting one. Not one you would typically expect to see on this type of list, but that’s Verizon Communications, the high-yielding dividend stock. And this stock has actually been on the list of Congress buys before, but it’s been bought even more so recently. So, look at the political buying. What do you notice? There wasn’t much activity for the last few years, but in Q4 of 2025, buying activity surged for this stock. In fact, we saw the most buying activity for Verizon that we’ve seen in the last 5 years in Q4 of 2025. Now, this is interesting because really, if we look at the share price over the last 5 years, it’s down by about 29%. If we look at it in the last 10 years, it’s not much better, down by about 9.81%. Now, total returns obviously tell a different story because the stock is a high yielder. It’s yielding about 6.7% as of right now. So, what do we make of Verizon stock right now? What’s the issue? Why is the share price not climbing? Or is it still potentially a good dividend play? Well, again, we have to remember over the long term, share price is going to follow the fundamental growth. And if we look at the sales growth over the last 5ish years, it’s really been relatively stagnant. We can see this; it hasn’t gone really anywhere. So, let’s dive into this a little bit more. If we jump back over to the fundamentals and look at the raw data, let’s take a look at revenue growth. This is what it looks like over the past decade. No wonder the share price really hasn’t moved. Revenue has not grown at a very high rate. Really, it’s been somewhat in line with inflation over the past decade. Even if we come down here and overlay the one-year revenue growth rates, we can see it’s typically in the low single-digit range. Every now and then, they’ll actually have a year of negative revenue growth. Now, if we pull up the most recent earnings report, one of the things we will notice is we can see right here, total operating revenue in the third quarter was up 1.5% year-over-year. So, slight growth in that area. If we scroll down and look at things like total Verizon consumer revenue, that saw growth of about 2.9% year-over-year. And if we look at total Verizon business revenue, that was a decrease of 2.8% year-over-year. So again, even in the most recent quarter, we’re talking about very small changes in what revenue growth has actually looked like. But that being said, with the outlook that they’re currently giving, they’re stating that they expect revenue growth to be in the range of 2 to 2.8% and adjusted EPS growth of about 1 to 3%. So they expect fundamentals to continue to grow, but it’s quite slow growth. So the reality is people who are interested in Verizon, they’re buying the stock primarily for one reason. One, they either think it’s undervalued at current prices or two, they’re buying it for the dividend. So really, let’s assess the sustainability of those dividends. Now, if we look at the dividend history for this stock, they have a history of growing those dividends even though free cash flow has not been growing at a high rate. In fact, if we jump back over to this slide, we can see they have 19 consecutive years of growing that dividend. So certainly a dividend growth stock, but the dividend growth is quite slow. And we have to remember anytime a stock is growing dividends at a rate below the rate of inflation, that’s technically not dividend growth. That’s something to keep in mind that doesn’t get discussed very often. Now, if we jump back over to their consolidated cash flow summary from their recent earnings presentation, again, we can assess the sustainability of those dividend payments. Dividends are paid out of free cash flow. And if we look at the 9 months of 2024, free cash flow is 14.5 while dividends paid out was 8.4 billion. So that’s a very sustainable dividend. And if we look at the 9 months of 2025, we can see yes, dividends are higher. They’ve grown their dividend payouts, but free cash flow is higher as well. So it continues to look like an actually very healthy around 7% starting dividend yield with relatively low leverage. It’s at least in their target range. So what we can see is yes, that starting dividend yield looks sustainable at about 6.7%. But what about the valuation at its current prices? Well, to start, we can see they trade at an extremely low PE multiple, just 8.65. Essentially the opposite of what we just saw for Broadcom. A PE multiple far below the average of the S&P 500. But again, that doesn’t tell us how the stock is actually being valued because we have to account for future growth. And as we’ve already seen, growth is very slow for Verizon Communications. Now, with that being said, we can still use a dividend discount model to value Verizon Communications. If they’re growing revenues, earnings, and free cash flow at a rate of about 2 to 3% moving forward, then dividend growth of 2.25% is sustainable moving forward. And if they can achieve that dividend growth rate, that would give them a fair value of about $44.54, implying 10% upside from their current prices. So absolutely this is by no means a high growth stock, not even a medium growth stock. It’s a very mature company that’s a very capital-intensive business with a lot of debt on the balance sheet. But with that being said, it does look manageable. The dividend looks sustainable and based on just a 2 to 2.5% dividend growth rate, the stock actually does look slightly undervalued. So we may see this share price revert back to its intrinsic value. But don’t expect a lot of growth past that other than the starting dividend yield that you’ll be receiving close to 6.67%. So there you go. Those are two stocks that members of Congress have been recently adding to their portfolio. Very interesting! Broadcom now going at $351. per share I guess my Megalomaniac ambitions will remain on the distant back burner for the time being. By contrast, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is cheap, pays over 7 percent at this price. The expectation of lower interest rates may be the main reason for the interest by the Critters, but they may also be loaded up with inside information. 👍 It’s never too late to start. 😁 Look at the chart for VZ. It’s movement over years is bad. Buy some AVGO over the weekend, and sell it about noon on Monday. VZ seems to pay a reliable 7% dividend. This past week there has been a storm-the-battlements rally for certain tech companies; I suspect there will be some burnoff on them. Naturally, over time, well-run companies go up in value, but not on a straight line. 🤔 Free cash flow for VZ: https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/VZ/verizon/free-cash-flow I certainly wouldn’t buy VZ for capital appreciation, but it is rock solid for a 7% dividend—at a time when it is tough to get even 4% on a cd or bond (not to mention the likely hood that interest rates will drop further in the coming year). Capital appreciation due to falling interest rates isn’t unlikely, but would be a short-lived phenomenon. VZ could become a trap regardless, as direct-to-satellite builds out over the next few years. Fatter dividends are available elsewhere among various capital mgmt outfits, but they are interest rate sensitive and are not immune to economic fluctuations. Jim Cramer is an idiot. He gets on my nerves (typical NBC politics), but he’s no idiot. Is there an ETF that trades based on following insiders? You can’t simply buy a stock that insiders buy, because you would also have to track when they sell. They might not buy & hold. An ETF is probably the best way to ride the tech tsunami that’s been going on, assuming it has a track record of good performance. Years ago a financial journalist had a piece in one of the mags back then. He looked at the best performaing mutual funds (ETFs are kinda new to this old guy who types with my hands), then researched who the managers were, and found that the all best performing funds had been run by just a handful of the best managers. Even the middlin’ ones can keep track of a basket of stocks better than any one of us can. In “Beating the Street”, Peter Lynch suggested self-managed portfolios are probably best limited to just five stocks. Nanci Pelosi is the New Cathy Wood.

Title: Database maker ClickHouse raises $400M, acquires AI observability startup Langfuse

UPDATED 16:49 EST / JANUARY 16 2026 by Maria Deutscher Open-source database maker ClickHouse Inc. today announced that it has closed a $400 million late-stage funding round at a $15 billion valuation. The Series D investment, which comes about six months after the company’s previous raise, was led by Dragoneer. It was joined by GIC, Index Ventures, Khosla Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, T. Rowe Price and WCM Investment Management. The round follows a year in which ClickHouse’s annualized recurring revenue rose by more than 250%. “Major platform shifts ultimately reward the infrastructure companies that sit closest to production,” said Dragoneer partner Christian Jensen. “As models become more capable, the bottleneck moves to data infrastructure.” A storage device is divided into segments called sectors. Usually, each sector holds a few hundred or thousand bytes. ClickHouse’s namesake database places columns in sectors that are immediately adjacent to one another. That approach enables it to perform data analysis tasks such as averaging product prices faster than many competing platforms. ClickHouse also speeds up queries in other ways. When a user searches a large dataset for a specific piece of information, the system avoids looking through sections of the database that don’t contain the relevant record. It takes a similar approach to speeding up data modification queries. ClickHouse only updates the specific records that a user wishes to change instead of the entire dataset. The company monetizes the open-source version of its database with a paid cloud version. ClickHouse Cloud, as the service is called, removes the need for customers to manage the underlying hardware or manually install updates. The administrative tasks that it doesn’t perform on users’ behalf can be automated through integrations with third-party management tools. The company disclosed that its cloud service has over 3,000 customers. Its installed base includes Meta Platforms Inc., Sony Corp., Lyft Inc. and other major tech firms. The company also divulged that it’s acquiring Langfuse GmbH, a startup with an open-source tool for monitoring large language models. Companies use Langfuse’s software to track the latency and infrastructure usage of their LLM-powered applications. Additionally, it collects data on the workflow through which a model generates prompt responses. Developers can use that data to identify the root cause of hallucinations and find a fix. Langfuse uses ClickHouse’s database to store the LLM telemetry it collects. Following the acquisition, the latter company will enhance the integration between the two products. ClickHouse says the goal is to make its database a more competitive choice for developers building AI applications. Some AI applications run on not one but two databases. One is used to process complex analytics queries while the other supports simpler, frequent data management tasks such as updating customer records. Systems geared toward the latter use case are known as transactional databases. ClickHouse plans to roll out the enhanced Langfuse integration alongside a managed transactional database based on PostgreSQL. Like Langfuse, the service will be integrated with the company’s namesake columnar store. AI applications can use ClickHouse to power analytics queries and the managed PostgreSQL service to perform transactional database tasks.

Daily Tech News 16 January 2026 Top Story The best graphics cards for gaming in 2026. (Tom's Hardware) At #2 is Nvidia's 5070 Ti, and at #5 is the 5060 Ti, both of which have ceased to exist. The best options for building a new PC with DDR4 RAM you already have. (Tom's Hardware) Both systems include the 5060 Ti, which as we have just noticed, has gone to the great parts bin in the sky. Nvidia has rebutted claims that the 5070 Ti and 5060 Ti are "end-of-life", insisting that all cards are still shipping and are just shagged out after a long render. (PC Magazine) The fact that you can't actually buy them is clearly a skill issue. Git gud, scrub. Hardware Unboxed - an Aussie hardware review channel - was planning a market roundup of currently available 5070 Ti models, and reached out to their industry contacts for review cards. There were no review cards to be had anywhere. (YouTube) Their contacts in the Australian retail market confirmed that there was no stock of the 5070 Ti at distributors at all, echoing recent reports from Germany and Japan. And Asus told them, and subsequently confirmed, that the 5070 Ti was "end-of-life", had ceased production, and would not be restocked. Then Nvidia... Clarified... That all RTX 5000 series cards are still in production, and Asus walked back earlier comments and agreed that the 5070 Ti is still in production. Hardware Unboxed requested - again - a review sample. There has been no response as yet. AMD meanwhile is working with its board partners to prevent GPU price hikes. (Notebook Check) Good luck with that. The 8GB 9060 XT seems to have bounced back up from its recent low price - it was briefly selling below MSRP - but it and the three 16GB cards (9060 XT, 9070, and 9070 XT) are all in stock. As is the 32GB 9700, though that model is quite expensive. Tech News TSMC plans to spend $56 billion on new production facilities and equipment this year. (WCCFTech) That's equal to three Nanyas. Reprompt is - or was, it's just been patched - a Copilot exploit that, once you clicked on the link, kept stealing your data even after you closed Copilot. (Hot Hardware) It worked like most so-called "Prompt Injection" vulnerabilities: It asked the AI for your data, and the AI helpfully handed it over because it has less self-interest than the average mycoplasma. This particular instance has been patched, but it was active in the wild for four months before Microsoft took action. This is why even people who use AI tools are up in arms about Microsoft integrating it directly into their operating system. If you use AI through your browser, it stops the moment you close the tab. Copilot never stops until you kill it with fire. Hot Hardware has a detailed article on removing it that involves running unsigned code directly out of GitHub because that may actually be safer than leaving Windows untouched. US senators are demanding answers from X (Twitter), Meta (Facebook), and Alphabet (Google) on sexualised deepfakes. (Tech Crunch) Answers to questions like "How do I do it?", "Does it have pictures of Sydney Sweeney?", and "You're not recording this are you? Stop recording right now!" Italy's privacy watchdog is under investigation for corruption and embezzlement. (Reuters) I am shocked, shocked, to see corruption and embezzlement going on in here! The Minisforum N5 Air is a $499 5-bay NAS. (Liliputing) It's a cheaper version of the N5 with a plastic rather than metal case, but otherwise almost identical. Apart from five 3.5" drive bays, it has room for three M.2 SSDs (with two running only at PCIe 4.0 x1 speed and one at x2), and includes a Ryzen 255 CPU, room for two DDR5 SODIMM modules (none as standard, so beware of that), and a whole lot of ports: OCuLink, two USB4 ports, 10Gb and 5Gb Ethernet, three USB3 10Gb ports, and HDMI. One of those USB3 ports is inside the system to host a boot device so that you can dedicate all the drives to data. The best office mini-PCs review by Notebookcheck. (Notebookcheck) Top spot goes to the Apple Mac Mini M4 Pro. With 64GB of RAM and 1TB of SSD, though, it costs more than three times as much as the same configuration for the Minisforum AI X1 at #5. (They list the 32GB model, but I bought the 64GB model.) The FDA has announced a recall of chocolate bars from Spring & Mulberry. (Southern Living) Then we have number four: Crunchy Frog. We use only the finest baby frogs, dew-picked and flown from Iraq, cleansed in the finest quality spring water, lightly killed, and sealed in a succulent, Swiss, quintuple-smooth, treble-milk chocolate envelope, and lovingly frosted with glucose. And what is this one: Spring Surprise? Ah, that's one of our specialities. Covered in dark, velvety chocolate, when you pop it into your mouth, stainless steel bolts spring out and plunge straight through both cheeks. Everything I ordered during my definitely not drunken New Years Eve shopping spree has now shipped. The SSDs doubled in price and the memory tripled the next day. I do need to pick up an AM4 CPU to use it all - the motherboard is on its way - but those are cheap and readily available.

Posted by: CrotchetyOldJarhead at January 16, 2026 05:42 AM (3Ope8) 41 Mary Poppins PPP I hope you are here today Last time you were here you mentioned that you felt numb and can't feel God. That's not unusual for all people of faith at some time or another. Here are some thoughts on that from a Christian perspective: https://tinyurl.com/yuz5arh4 I am praying for you. Posted by: FenelonSpoke at January 16, 2026 05:48 AM (Nx5jP) 42 Yeah, I'm not believing a word from Nvidia on that 5070 Ti/5060 Ti walkback. They said the same thing about the availablility of their cards this time last year and it all turned out to be B.S., and that was before memory prices skyrocketed. Once they finally got their cards into the supply stream the prices were well above MSRP and still are for the higher VRAM cards, especially the 5080 and 5090 which have never come close to MSRP. So maybe they'll keep selling 5070 Ti and 5060 Ti but you probably aren't going to enjoy paying $1000 for what's supposed to be a $750 card, or $650 for what's supposed to be a $430 card. AMD can make some real headway here in the midrange GPU market if they don't shoot themselves in the foot.

Title: Future of Marketing Briefing: X claims an ad comeback, reality proves out a different thesis

This Future of Marketing Briefing covers the latest in marketing for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Friday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → A claim from X has has taken on a life of its own after I featured it in a story I wrote earlier this month. X’s ads boss said that nearly all of the platform’s top 100 advertisers were “back” without a breakout of who those advertisers were, no context around what “back” meant and no disclosure of how much money they were actually spending. I asked. There were no numbers forthcoming. “We are more focused on advertising than ever before,” said X’s global head of advertising Monique Pintarelli. “We have a number of brands that are not just back, they’re spending at or higher than pre-acquisition levels,” she added, without specific figures. Skepticism was warranted. On its own, the comments were thin. But in the churn of hot takes and screenshots, the remark quickly became shorthand for something much bigger — the idea that X’s advertising business was effectively healed. The article itself did not make that leap. It went out of its way not to. So consider this week’s briefing a reset. Not a redemption arc. Just a closer look at where X’s ad business actually sits right now. Short version: the comeback narrative has gotten ahead of the reality. The numbers — what little of them there are — support that. The original piece cited Sensor Tower data showing that while more than six in 10 of the biggest advertisers on X in 2022 are still spending on the platform, they are doing so at a fraction of their prior levels. Additional data only reinforces that. Digiday requested data from Ebiquity, which shared insights from clients, primarily of large multinational brand advertisers, that it provides digital governance and auditing services to. Clients work for over 75 of the top 100 global advertisers based on their advertising spend worldwide. Ad spend on X hasn’t recovered from its 2023 spend level based on Ebiquity’s data, staying roughly flat. The number of clients in Ebiquity’s database spending on X has gone down year-on-year: 40 in 2022, 25 in 2023, 11 in 2024 and seven in 2025, with the latest figure still subject to change as filings are finalized. Taken together, the data adds context to Pintarell’s comments. It is likely true that most of the platform’s top 100 advertisers have resumed some level of spending after pulling back in 2022 amid concerns over Elon Musk’s ownership. In some respects, it would be more surprising if they had not. What has followed since Musk’s takeover has hardly been a courtship. He has publicly ridiculed the advertising, undermined some parts of it and threatened legal action against others. In response, it would appear many advertisers returned to X with the bare minimum — enough to ease those tensions, not enough to signal confidence. Yes, there are outliers. But the idea that ad dollars have meaningfully returned — or that X’s ad business is anything close to “back” — is tenuous at best. Take GYK Antler, for example. The agency’s head of media Adam Telian said that none of the brands he works with have resumed spending on X, and the platform hasn’t been a part of the conversation for several years. Similarly, Brave Bison’s director of paid media Mark Byrne said that X has fallen down client wishlists and is rarely pushed proactively in media plans. An ensuing scandal will have only sharpened those concerns. In recent weeks, X’s AI tool Grok has been used to generate manipulated images of real people, including women and minors, in sexually explicit ways, often by removing their clothes. Users began documenting and reporting these examples in late December and into the new year. Though on Wednesday, X announced that the team has “implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis. This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.” And while it’s a step in the right direction, it isn’t a total U-turn that prevents users from using Grok to create any other type of inappropriate content. For brand advertisers, this is not a footnote. It is the environment, one far removed from anything that resembles a stable or normalized marketplace. “There doesn’t seem to be a good handle on content safety such as what other platforms like Meta and TikTok have, which further leads me to believe that X isn’t the best option for many advertisers,” said paid social media expert Shamsul Chowdhury. It’s a perspective shared by Byrne, who noted that this recent issue has heightened sensitivity around where budgets end up. “For some advertisers, it extends beyond brand safety in the traditional sense into whether they want to be seen supporting certain environments at all,” he said. “That makes controls, exclusions and transparency more important than ever.” Which calls into question why any brand would ever want to fund a platform like X? Aside from the threat of being named, shamed and sued by Musk, the upside is hard to see. What remains may be less a vote of confidence than a form of inadvertent participation. Turns out, marketers could be buying ads on X without realizing. The platform makes a meaningful portion of its ads available via programmatic auctions, and in doing so makes it easier for marketers to end up there without ever making an affirmative decision to do so. Here’s how: when a marketer buys ads on Google Ads there’s a chance they will buy ads on X, which is available at cheap ad prices there following a deal struck in 2023. Moreover, because of those prices, Google’s buying algorithms may optimize spend toward those places. The only way to avoid this, is if marketers instruct those algorithms not to buy from X. “When I have been auditing brands’ Google Ads activity over the last year or so, X makes an appearance in placement reporting for the ones that are not critically reviewing where their ads are serving, which has caught out the majority of brands as to why that is happening in the first place,” said ad tech consultant Jonathan D’Souza Rauto. It’s a timely reminder to be more deliberate about what’s being bought. Chowdhury pointed out that advertisers, especially those who are price sensitive, likely aren’t looking under the hood to evaluate where they’re showing up. But it does still add to Pintarelli’s point that more advertisers are genuinely back on X. But as Byrne put it, there’s a difference between a genuine return to X as a planned, strategic platform and X appearing in delivery as a by-product of automation. All told, X remains an anomaly in the media space: influential without being dependable, unavoidable without being trustworthy and still large enough to matter even as it drifts further from what most of the market would recognize as a functional advertising platform. 1.6%: Forecasted percent increase for U.K. 2026 ad spend, according to IPA’s Q4 2025 Bellwether report 64%: Percentage of marketers which predict their customers will use traditional search engines less often in the coming 2-3 years 28%: Percentage of retail commerce media decision makers in North America and Europe which still review and approve creatives manually 80%: Percentage of advertisers who believe Gen Z and millennial consumers feel positively about AI-generated ads, however only 45% of these consumers actually feel that way ‘More focused on advertising than ever before’: Nearly all of X’s top 100 advertisers returned, ads boss claims The story which started it all off and became the building block for this briefing. Also in this story is the fact that X has big plans for the Super Bowl next month, from its Super Bowl portal, to a new Grok-powered BrandRanx tool for advertisers and users. ‘Intentionally being cautious’: Why the ad industry isn’t ready to let AI agents spend ad dollars While planning, buying and optimization autonomously by LLM-powered agents are always framed as just over the horizon, advertisers are clear on one thing: they want to use it to automate workflows, not automate buying decisions.

The platform is recasting its DSP less as a place marketers go, and more as infrastructure their systems can plug into. Why ByteDance’s stock should rise after TikTok deal closes ByteDance putting a close to the ongoing fight over TikTok in the U.S., could mean that the path is clear for the tech giant to finally go public, according to The Information. Dubai continues its creator-wooing efforts with a splashy Amazon partnership Dubai is still on a mission to attract creators and the latest part of that strategy is a new Amazon partnership, called the Amazon Creators Foundry, according to TubeFilter Elon Musk denies Grok generates illegal content Despite the global outrage over Grok’s latest scandal, Elon Musk has still denied that Grok has created any illegal content, saying it’s users who are responsible, not the technology, according to Politico. Big Tech spared strict rules in EU digital regulations overhaul, sources say Google, Meta, Netflix, Microsoft and Amazon won’t face heavy regulations in Europe’s overhauled Digital Network’s Act and will only be subject to a voluntary framework rather than binding rules, according to Reuters. Microsoft’s CEO just handed ad execs a survival guide for the agentic era. OpenAI is focused on constructing the machine before worrying about selling what comes out of it.
