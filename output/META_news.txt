Reliance Jio is gearing up for a potential record-breaking IPO by the first half of 2026. While analysts see it as a major value-unlocking event, concerns remain over execution risks, holding company discounts, and missed opportunities from not pursuing a demerger. Jio’s massive scale, new product launches, and strong subscriber growth continue to fuel investor interest and speculation.

Mukesh Ambani is gearing up for Jio's mega IPO — tipped as the "mother of all IPOs" – but Reliance Industries' 44 lakh shareholders may be sidelined. Unlike the Jio Financial Services spin-off, this listing won't give them direct shares. Instead, they'll benefit indirectly via RIL’s 66.3% stake, which may face a holding company discount from investors seeking direct exposure.

Title: The crash of 2026: a fiction
URL: https://crookedtimber.org/2025/08/31/the-crash-of-2026-a-fiction/
Time Published: 2025-08-31T21:39:55Z
Full Content:
by John Q on August 31, 2025 Looking at the facts, there’s no reasonable conclusion except that US democracy is done for. But rather than face facts, I’m turning to fiction. So, here’s a story about the collapse of Trumpism, crony capitalism and the AI/crypto bubble. Fiction is a relatively unfamilar mode of writing for me, so critique (on style and structure rather than plausibility) is most welcome. The crash of 2026 began with a literal crash. A Tesla robotaxi operating on an open highway for the first time, inexplicably swerved into the path of oncoming traffic. Coming in the other direction was a Cybertruck whose driver, relying on self-driving capabilities, was busy checking his investments on the phone. His instant death spared him from the knowledge of his impending bankruptcy. Tragically, a school bus was following, and its brakes failed (the school district later blamed budget cuts for inadequate maintenance) The driver did her best to steer around the wreckage but the bus overturned and burst into flames. By the time the smoke cleared, there were six deaths, including the busdriver and two children, as well as the occupants of both Teslas. More then 30 schoolchildren were taken to hospital. The images of death and disaster ran on TV and social media for weeks. The reaction was swift. By the end of the day, Tesla’s robotaxis had been taken off the road throughout the US, and demands for retribution were everywhere. Several Tesla dealerships were torched and others closed down. The situation wasn’t helped by a bizarre tweet from Elon Musk, appearing to suggest that the bus driver was a “crisis actor”. By the time Wall Street opened the next day, the financial analysts had done their sums. The legal liability for the disaster would run into billions, enough to wipe out most of Tesla’s cash reserves. And with the robotaxi business gone, there was nothing to conceal the truth of Tesla’s situation: a company with declining sales and margins trading at more than 100 times its current earnings. With the prospect of massive short sales at the opening bell, trading in Tesla shares was suspended. This was bad news for Musk, who faced margin calls and the loss of his holdings in X and SpaceX, both secured by his ownership of 16 per cent of Tesla. But as usual in such cases, he got off easily. Musk turned up soon afterwards on a Caribbean island he had bought through a shell company years previously, along with the government of the nation that supposedly ruled it. No longer the richest man in the world, and theoretically bankrupt, he nonetheless enjoyed the comforts of a mansion and a super-yacht, each with its fleet of servants. The situation was rather different for the owners of the other 84 per cent of Tesla, who collectively faced the loss of nearly a trillion dollars. Those with diversified holdings and no debt took the loss philosophically, as an offset against the massive profits of recent years. But others, who had borrowed to buy both Tesla and crypto assets like Bitcoin, faced disaster, especially when rumors spread that Tesla was about to dump its own massive Bitcoin holding. The price of Bitcoin fell 25 per cent overnight. Longstanding HODLers were not concerned, reminding themselves that Bitcoin had fallen many times before, and had always rebounded. But now that crypto-currencies were embedded into the financial system, there were plenty of players with a shorter-term perspective. They started talking to economists, who almost universally agreed that crypto-currencies were inherently worthless. Traders who had gone all in on crypto suddenly saw the merits of profit taking. Regulators, who had been quiet since the passage of the GENIUS Act, started asking questions. The real disaster came with the exposure of large-scale fraud at Tether, the most prominent of the stablecoins, which were supposed to trade at exactly $1 US. As the volume of investors seeking to quit crypto increased, it emerged that the supposedly ironclad asset backing of Tether had been undermined by a complex web of derivative transactions, allegedly the doing of a “rogue trader”. Once Tether “broke the buck” the run was on in earnest. Wall Street banks found that that they had significant direct exposure to crypto and even more through their counterparties. They went into lockdown, calling in whatever debts they could. The realisation that the multi-trillion dollar valuations of Tesla and Bitcoin had been spun out of thin air led to a harder look at Wall Street’s “Magnificent Seven” now reduced to six. Claims that AI was about to generate massive wealth if only more billions were invested looked silly. Investment in data centers stopped abruptly. Nvidia was the first casualty. Once orders for chips from the hyperscalers dried up, its business was over. The advertising businesses of Google and Meta, and the Amazon retail business, went next. There would be no growth in sales of consumer goods for some time to come. Microsoft and Apple, with real businesses and products, fared better, but their values, based on hyperbolic price-earnings ratios, fell drastically. Crowds of ruined investors, milling in the streets, became violent, and were suppressed by heavily armed and masked thugs, presumed to be ICE, with several deaths. Increasingly violent protests and even more violent suppression followed. At this point, a global financial crisis similar to that of 2008 was now inevitable. There were loud calls for an internationally co-ordinated response. But such co-ordination, already inadequate in 2008, was non-existent this time. Fed Chair Kevin Hassett, appointed by Trump after the removal of Jerome Powell, couldn’t even get his global counterparts to pick up the phone. With less direct exposure to the crisis, other countries sought to protect themselves, imposing exchange controls, and preventing repatriation of funds to the US. Crypto trading was banned in many jurisdictions, and holders of crypto were required to report their positions to regulators. Taken collectively, these disasters threatened to wipe out the entire wealth of the Trump family. Naturally, Trump struck back, announcing the discovery that trillions of dollars in US foreign debt was fraudulent, and would be expropriated. The remaining US public debt, following the plans previously announced by Stephen Miran (chair of Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers) would be forcibly converted into 100 year bonds, at rates to be set by the US. The EU and Canada reacted by freezing US-owned assets. Trading on major stock exchanges around the world was suspended. At this point, global capitalism seemed doomed, along with democracy. But somehow things turned around. With their donors facing ruin, dozens of Republican Representatives and Senators switched sides, throwing control of Congress to the Democrats, who immediately announced impeachment proceedings against Trump. Trump called on JD Vance to expel the traitors from the Senate, but, sensing the ground shifting, Vance temporised. Trump attempted to declare martial law, but was forestalled by Vance and the Cabinet, who invoked the 25th Amendment to remove him. At Trump’s urging, a MAGA mob, including dozens of the masked gunmen now ubiquitous on American streets, marched on the Capitol, planning a repeat of 2020. But this time they were met by the army, with fixed bayonets and machine-gun emplacements. After a brief exchange of fire, the crowd fled, leaving dozens of dead and wounded behind. The Vance Administration lasted only a few days. After seeking assurances that he would not face prosecution, Vance resigned in favor of Jerome Powell, who had been hastily appointed as Vice-President and was seen as the technocrat most likely to restore faith in the US, The fallout was rapid. Facing impeachment and likely criminal charges of corruption, Supreme Court justices Thomas and Alito resigned, while Gorsuch and Kavanaugh decided that their appointments had been improper all along. The five remaining members of the court unanimously overturned the previous finding of Trump’s presidential immunity, and discovered that participation in the January 6 insurrection was in fact treasonous. Facing this catastrophic defeat, MAGA fragmented. A minority of Trump’s supporters genuinely repented of the disaster they had brought on their country and became zealous defenders of democracy. Another group pointed to the feeble statements they had made criticising Trump and tried, with varying degrees of success, to maintain a role in public life. Some of the MAGA base gave up on politics altogether, suddenly discovering that Trump was just as corrupt as the Democrats he had railed against. Others remained loyal to their fallen leader. Republican state governments collapsed as the party fragmented. Trump’s trial proceeded rapidly this time, and he was sentenced to spend his remaining days in prison, along with many of his cronies. There were some scattered insurrections which were rapidly put down, with their participants held in the various detention centres conveniently created by Trump. Now, in early 2028, the world economy is gradually climbing out of the pit created by the crisis. The financial sector, a shadow of its former self, remains largely nationalised, and the disastrous losses in the crypto sector have yet to be resolved. But AI technologies, now in the public domain after the collapse of the hyperscalars. have started deliver significant (though not stratospheric) productivity benefits. Continued declines in the cost of solar power and battery storage have dispelled concerns about shortages of electricity, and have supported new investments in rewiring the economy in the US and other countries. The reconstruction of the US political system will take much longer. President Powell, virtually assured of re-election, has proposed a constitutional convention that would replace the failed two-party system. The first step, already implemented in most states, has been a shift to instant runoff voting in Congressional elections, along with the scrapping of the primary system. But a shift to full-scale proportional representation is expected, with the former Republican party splintering, and socialists gaining significant support in cities and even some rural areas. There is, as Adam Smith observed, a great deal of ruin in a nation. It will take decades for Americans to repair all the damage done by their experiment with fascism. But America has huge resources, both human and natural, and (at least in this fictional account) the traditions of democracy are finally reasserting themselves. { 24 comments… read them below or add one } Alex SL 08.31.25 at 10:55 pm That is a very nice narrative, and it is obvious that a large financial crash is coming. If it is frightening enough to Republicans, it may well end Trump’s administration. Unfortunately, it is otherwise all too optimistic. Among the fundamental constants of the last few decades that have got the USA into this mess are: First, there are never any consequences for powerful and rich people. The only way to see consequences for a powerful and rich person is if they first lose their wealth; that is why Sam Bankman-Fried, Elizabeth Holmes, and Bernie Madoff ended up in prison but Adam Neumann, Elon Musk, and Donald Trump never did, because the former lost their wealth, and the latter did not. God forbid that a billionaire or, for that matter, a former president ever sees repercussions like the little people for breaking laws or doing a war crime. No matter how bad an economic crash, the people who caused it will not feel any consequences. This culture of shielding the powerful and rich at all costs also means that no, the supreme court justices will not resign. That idea is unthinkable to them, as it is to the vast majority of Americans. There is no solution to this problem except a deep cultural change where the American public at large sees billionaires, elected officials, and judges as deserving more accountability than a weed dealer or a shoplifter, because, as the comic book hero goes, with great power comes great responsibility. And I don’t see that happening overnight. Second, MAGA is a cult, and it is not going away even if Trump dies tomorrow or is removed from office next year. They will be back in 2028 or 2030 or 2032 or 2032, and their mission will still be to abolish democracy, to destroy science, to remove minorities from any position of status and responsibility, and to conduct ethnic cleansing. There is no solution to this problem except to purge the Republican party of MAGA, and to make the entire right-wing media ecosystem illegal, and to completely overhaul the US education system, including making home schooling illegal. None of that is going to happen in my lifetime. So, within a few years the goldfish-like memories of the voters will just bring MAGA back under a different name and with a different leader. Third, the Democrats are utterly useless. Even if brought back into power (and it would have to be them, as president Powell is much less likely than president Vance putting Powell back into the Fed to restore faith), they will not implement the reforms outlined in the second-to-last paragraph. They are in their happy place fund-raising and handing that money over to consultants who tell them to go further to the right and seek bipartisan solutions on ethnic cleansing oh sorry immigration. There is no solution to this problem except to purge the Democratic party of centrists, and given the realities of primaries, the byzantine campaign donation systems, and the hilariously undemocratic intra-party governance of the USA, that isn’t ever going to happen. I would love for a better outcome, but realistically, the choice is between (1) fascism and (2) a few years of hapless centrists not solving any of the structural issues that lead to fascism, followed by fascism. Cheryl Rofer 08.31.25 at 11:19 pm This is very good. Thank you, John! John Hamilton Farr 08.31.25 at 11:59 pm Damn that’s good… John Q 09.01.25 at 12:14 am @Alex You’ll notice that all the leading figures except Trump (along with unnamed cronies) get off scot-free. It’s fiction, not fantasy. Seekonk 09.01.25 at 12:29 am Brilliant! Rich 09.01.25 at 1:14 am Too optimistic! Where is the dystopia? Where are the zombies? John Q 09.01.25 at 2:14 am Rich @6 There’s not much point in fiction about a dystopia when you’re already in one. And there’s loads of financial zombies, not to mention Zombie Economics Cheez Whiz 09.01.25 at 3:46 am Well thought out and well done, Mr. Quiggan. I raised an eyebrow over the collapse of crypto, but its likely once money guys get scared enough to look. I raised the other eyebrow at the popping of the AI bubble, but again, a good scare might do it. But when the Republicans went along with Vance giving up the White House, I was out of eyebrows. Republicans willingly surrendering Trump is entirely believeable in this scenario, but giving up power by giving up Vance? This is not our Republican party. The screams from Fox and the Freedom Caucus would deafen the world, and this would be the moment Vance and Theil have been planning for years. Vance might be forced out by a Democratic party that grew a continental-sized spine, but it would be a bloody fight. Dan Strong 09.01.25 at 6:44 am I’m with Alex SL on this one – I enjoyed the story, but it did strike me as hopelessly rosy-eyed. It’s hard to swallow the suggestion that there are, in fact, limits to what the Republican party would tolerate from Trump. Not to mention the idea that the sclerotic Democratics would be able or willing to effectively exploit a political crisis of the right. John Q 09.01.25 at 8:18 am Dan @9 Did you read the opening para of the post ? Mike Huben 09.01.25 at 12:49 pm The most improbable thing (to me) is the resignation of the Supreme Court justices. If anything, resigning would make them even more vulnerable. Not to mention that the right-wing corruption would continue to bribe them, now to stay in office. Dave 09.01.25 at 1:37 pm I believe this will all happen exactly as described, but over a few decades instead of years. nastywoman 09.01.25 at 2:18 pm SOOO BEAUTIFUL!!!! – and we play with most of it already on our game of WOR(L)D DOMINATION with the UTMOST BEAUTIFUL ADDITIONAL SINK of NEW YORK and CALIFORNIA going FULL SOCIALIST (in any Americans Mind) and doing completely their OWN FUN SINK (as Elon would) say – why Elon is currently -actually far, faaar too involved in his WAR against the UK and Germany that he put the US kind of on PAUSE. YES SIR!!! Harry 09.01.25 at 2:41 pm “Second, MAGA is a cult, and it is not going away even if Trump dies tomorrow or is removed from office next year. They will be back in 2028 or 2030 or 2032 or 2032, and their mission will still be to abolish democracy, to destroy science, to remove minorities from any position of status and responsibility, and to conduct ethnic cleansing” It is a cult, but it is a personality cult. Once Trump is out of the way it will fragment, as personality cults often do. This may not be as optimistic as it sounds — there are a lot of very people in the cult who are unstable, angry, and armed. And maybe someone can pull together another personality cult composed of some of the fragments, plus other dangerous forces. I can’t think who, but then in 2014 I had no idea a Trump could. Gwyneth Paltrow? Jerry Brown 09.01.25 at 4:07 pm It has the elements of a story. There are an awful lot of villains and at least some of them get their just rewards. The protagonists need some development. Maybe some more work developing Powell as a reluctant hero. And you have to change the names of course. And sex sells so you want some in there somehow with this bunch. Maybe think George Clooney as the Powell character on the verge of being fired for some Trumped up charge on the eve of the traffic accident. And he gets saved by some unlikely heroine somewhere in the judicial system. Maybe like a fictional Amy Coney Barret type who sees through the Trumped up charges and decides to act in the interest of justice for a change. Stranger things have happened. Laban 09.01.25 at 4:50 pm “a repeat of 2020” You mean a guy in a buffalo head dress being escorted through the Capitol by officers ? I seem to remember far worse unpleasantness in the name of George Floyd, which people seemed quite pleased about. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/trump-flees-to-bunker-as-protests-over-george-floyd-rage-outside-white-house I think the dollar is unlikely to still be the reserve currency by 2100, unless by some miracle the United States can be re-industrialised. I think that’s what he’s trying to do, however imperfectly, but he only has 3.5 years and a nation divided in many ways who have watched living standards fall for decades . China has a high-IQ, hardworking* population which is far less multicultural, and living standards and morale are on the up. It’s not that I’ll welcome our new Chinese overlords. Anyone working in the tourist industry will tell you Americans are much more generous. the point of the Chinese Exclusion Act was basically – “these guys work too hard for too little”. Michael Cain 09.01.25 at 5:57 pm I wouldn’t be so sure that the regular military would respond quickly to a President Vance’s order — based on a 25th Amendment takeover — to deploy and fire on American civilians. Trump has been replacing a lot of high-level officers based on what looks like a loyalty requirement. It seems possible that we would instead get a demonstration of “This is why the Founders didn’t want a standing army.” JimV 09.01.25 at 6:30 pm What I’ve heard recently about MAGA (and believed) is that about 37% of the people in the USA (and maybe elsewhere but with different focuses) are mean sociopaths or worse who enjoy Trump exactly for all the evil things he does, and are going to be with us always, some of them billionaires. So even if things do get better, they will get worse again, and the story, which I enjoyed, has some fantasy in it. (I enjoy good fantasy.) Robert J Berger 09.01.25 at 8:14 pm Loved it, wish it comes true. (the later part with Trump and his Minions in Jail and the country comes to its senses, hopefully we can avoid total economic destruction) Cheez Whiz 09.01.25 at 10:55 pm But those soldiers were chosen for loyalty to Trump personally. With Trump out of the picture where do their sympathies land? Questions like this abound throughout the (optimistic) scenario here, and is why the honest reality-adjacent answer is “nobody knows”. There’s a list of authoritarian personality cults to compare, with a range of outcomes (as I read somewhere) from The People’s Temple to Scientology. Can Vance be David Miscavige? Man has devoted himself to presenting as an empty suit, so who knows. J-D 09.02.25 at 12:15 am Alex SL’s reaction on finding John Quiggin’s story implausible is to make suggestions which are much less plausible. Alex SL 09.02.25 at 12:30 am Harry, These people existed before a Trump candidacy was a twinkle in anybody’s eye. For many decades now, they became school board members to push for creationism, they have worked towards filling the judiciary with Federalist Society hacks, they have carefully built a vast radicalisation machine ranging from local radio across Fox News to Youtube influencers, they have effectively infinity bribe money for elections at their disposal and an entire network of think tanks to influence elected officials, all with the aim of transforming the USA into a white-dominated plutocracy with the civil rights of, at best, the late 19th century. (I think they would not re-introduce racial chattel slavery… probably… but many of the libertarians among them would likely be okay with indentured servitude, as they think that any contract is ethical and acceptable if it is entered into without literally having a gun held to one’s head; they don’t count “if you don’t do this, you will starve to death” as coercion, and the only freedom they care about is that of the wealthy to do as they please with their wealth.) Do you think these people will go away or conclude that they are now in favour of liberal democracy, a welfare state, scientific expertise, and gay marriage once Trump is gone? This authoritarian movement didn’t start with Trump. It merely coalesced around him. It has completely taken over the Republican party. It will stay, and it will come back electorally even if they lose the next two elections, which would in turn depend on ICE not standing guard in front of most polling places to, ahem, “maintain order”. It would take a generational effort to discredit this movement, and there is no sign that any significant, organised counter-movement exists to undertake that effort. Chetan Murthy 09.02.25 at 2:11 am Oof. John, I thought I was pessimistic. Capital controls, expropriation, oof. Not saying you’re wrong. I moved my 401k entirely out of US investment and into European ones. But they’re still housed in a US brokerage, so haha, subject to expropriation and capital controls. Sigh. Goddamn FATCA and FBAR. Chetan Murthy 09.02.25 at 2:24 am Dan @ 9: I would answer differently from John Q. I also -fear- that there are no “limits to what the Republican party would tolerate from Trump”. None at all. In that case, this ends in one of two other ways: civil war in America America collapses and the rest of the world walls it off and goes its own way B/c they’re speed-running the destruction of the systems that keep America working. When those systems fall apart, either the G(r)OPers turn (John Q’s scenario), or there’s civil war, or America descends into some sort of hell. I say this to my European, Asian, and elsewhere friends: plan on a world without America. Plan on it. Hell, plan on a world in which America is your enemy. I’ve lived in America since I was four years old. I’m the sort of American who hasn’t left the country since 2007 (work trip). I spent 3yr in France on a postdoc. Besides that and a few trips for work, I’ve never left the country. I’m -that- sort of American: stay-at-home. A week ago, I booked travel to France to start re-learning French and look around for a place to emigrate to. Maybe it won’t be France. But it’s coming. I regret not having done it in early 2025; it’s time to do it now. We’re falling apart. Maybe not the way John Q describes it, but we -are- falling apart. [As Dan says] Our elites are either complicit or feckless cowards. That’s no way to run a country. Prepare yourselves, prepare your countries. Talk to your elected officials.

Title: NVIDIA & Magnificent 7: Too Hot To Handle?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/08/31/nvidia--magnificent-7-too-hot-to-handle/

ByBill Stone, Contributor. As the dominant supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) chips, NVIDIA (NVDA) has become the largest company in the world and within the S&P 500 index. Following NVIDIA’s earnings last week, it’s an appropriate time to revisit the attractiveness of large technology stocks with a special emphasis on NVIDIA. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), collectively account for nearly 34% of the S&P 500’s market capitalization. Eight of the ten largest companies in the S&P 500 are technology companies, including Broadcom (AVGO). Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) are the only non-technology companies in the top ten. Investors already appreciate the strong fundamentals of the Magnificent 7, and NVIDIA in particular, with stock returns far outstripping those of the S&P 500. The Magnificent 7 and NVIDIA have achieved total returns of 280% and 1,093%, respectively, since the start of the ChatGPT era at the end of 2022, while the S&P 500 has returned 75%. Based on the past twelve months of earnings and consensus earnings estimates for the next twelve months, the price-to-earnings ratios for all the Magnificent 7 stocks are above the S&P 500. While this ratio indicates that most of these companies have a higher valuation on both measures, it doesn’t answer whether other factors justify that premium. Another way to value companies is by their multiple revenues, which is called the price-to-sales ratio. All the Magnificent 7 are valued at price-to-sales ratios above the S&P 500, with NVIDIA at an almost twenty-seven times price-to-sales ratio. Historical annualized growth in sales over the last three and five years has been impressive for most of the group, but downright amazing for NVIDIA. Likewise, historical earnings per share growth has generally been impressive and exceptional, as seen in cases like NVIDIA. The five-year annualized earnings per share growth rate of the Magnificent 7 demonstrates just how unique these companies have been when compared to the stock market as a whole. Future earnings are the most crucial criterion when considering whether to buy or hold a stock. Consensus forecasts from Wall Street analysts still evidence significant optimism about NVIDIA’s earnings growth prospects, with 39% annualized growth expected from the world’s largest company. Separately, the sustainable growth rate for the group supports the future growth story. The sustainable growth rate theoretically indicates how fast a company can grow without borrowing additional funds while maintaining its existing capital structure. The profitability metrics of most of the Magnificent 7 are impressive. Gross margins represent the profitability after all direct expenses, specifically the cost of goods sold, have been deducted from sales. Operating margins measure how much a company earns on a dollar of sales after paying for the variable expenses, or the percentage of sales converted into operating income. NVIDIA converted almost seventy cents of every sales dollar into operating profit over the last year. While NVIDIA’s gross margin was about 70% over the previous year, it improved to 75% in the most recent quarter. Just looking at a simple high price-to-earnings ratio can be deceiving when analyzing a company with high returns on invested capital (ROIC). It is crucial to consider the return generated on the capital needed to fund a business, since a company with a sustainably higher ROIC should sell at a valuation premium. To put some of the impressive return on invested capital figures for the Magnificent 7 into proper perspective, the ROIC for the S&P 500 is around 8%. Furthermore, most companies in the Magnificent 7 generate substantial amounts of free cash flow, despite investing in growing businesses. The free cash flow margin indicates the percentage of revenue that the company can utilize or distribute to shareholders as free cash flow. NVIDIA is exceptional, with almost forty-four cents of every dollar in sales converted to free cash flow. The free cash flow yield refers to the free cash flow per share generated by a business, expressed as a percentage of its stock price. Value investors, such as Warren Buffett, value a company based on the cash that can be distributed from a business over its lifetime, discounted back to the present. Free cash flow can be a good measure of the money available to owners. A free cash flow yield below that of the S&P 500, such as the Magnificent 7 and NVIDIA, can be seen as investors already pricing in superior growth and durability of free cash flow relative to the market. NVIDIA is particularly notable given the massive increase in its market capitalization, which now exceeds $4.2 trillion, driven by the artificial intelligence spending wave. The consumer introduction of ChatGPT as an artificial intelligence tool in late 2022 coincided with a sharp rise in NVIDIA’s valuation, as the company became the dominant supplier of AI semiconductors. There has been some concern about NVIDIA’s relatively meager beat of consensus earnings estimates last week and less exceptional guidance than has been typical. There were zero sales to China in the quarter due to geopolitical tensions, which made for more challenging comparisons. For example, data center sales, which were impacted by China, declined by 1% quarter-over-quarter, but were up about 12% quarter-over-quarter excluding China, according to TD Cowen. Despite NVIDIA’s less optimistic forward guidance than was hoped, a resumption in sales to China could add $2 to $5 billion in sales. In the short term, NVIDIA’s dominance in high-end artificial intelligence computing appears untouchable, as its next-generation platform is on pace for meaningful production next year. Furthermore, the company continues to benefit from AI demand outstripping supply, alleviating concerns about potential pricing pressures. It appears likely that AI will be a transformative tool for businesses and households, generating substantial economic benefits. Although it is still early, indications suggest that artificial intelligence adoption is continuing at a brisk pace. The capital spending (capex) by AI-leaders, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft, to support complex computations needed to support AI, has seen a massive rise since 2023. NVIDIA reaped significant revenue from this spending as the leading chip provider for AI. Estimates are that capital spending by these four AI leaders will exceed $400 billion by 2026. What if demand for AI services doesn’t meet expectations or the firms are unable to monetize the services at a profitable enough level? Capital expenditures (capex) budgets can indeed be slashed if needed. This downside risk isn’t a forecast, but it must be considered when evaluating NVIDIA and all AI-connected technology stocks. Notably, these sizable capital expenditures are more sustainable than some past instances, because the companies are highly profitable and can self-fund rather than depending on the charity of lenders or additional capital. Though it is nowhere in sight, one must always be wary of some competing technology eventually displacing NVIDIA as a dominant leader. Capitalism subjects companies to intense competition in their pursuit of profits, and the profits generated by technology leaders make them an attractive target. The bullish case for large tech and NVIDIA is bolstered by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). The mega-cap technology stocks, represented by the Magnificent 7, continue to produce earnings and free cash flow at impressive rates. Large technology stocks typically exhibit exceptional profitability compared to the average stock and should therefore trade at a premium valuation. The rise in the stock prices of the Magnificent 7, including NVIDIA, has been supported by robust fundamentals and not just a promise of future profitability. Investors buy or hold companies for their future profits, not their past performance. The past is only significant to the extent that it informs the firm’s future prospects. While one needs to remain mindful of risk, the robust adoption rate of artificial intelligence, combined with companies’ ability to self-fund the massive costs required to build AI infrastructure, implies that the end is not yet here. Investors should be mindful of the risk associated with concentrated holdings, given the remarkable growth of some of these technology leaders. Disclosure: Glenview Trust may hold stocks mentioned in this article within its recommended investment strategies.

31 August 2025 Time taken to read : 11 Minute KATHMANDU: Economic Digest offers a concise yet comprehensive overview of significant business happenings in Nepal, presented in easily digestible summaries. The recent developments in Nepal reflect a mix of economic, infrastructural, and regulatory shifts, impacting various sectors. The Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) has rebounded with a 23-point gain, signaling improved market sentiment after a period of significant losses. Meanwhile, discussions around opening the electricity trading market to private players are gaining momentum, with the aim of enhancing competition and market expansion. However, monsoon disruptions have heavily affected the country’s transportation infrastructure, blocking nine major highways and complicating travel. On the regulatory front, the Nepal Rastra Bank has tightened guidelines for banks’ Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) spending to ensure more transparent and targeted use of funds. The government is also making strides to exit the FATF grey list by presenting progress on anti-money laundering measures. At the same time, sugarcane farmers have threatened a national highway blockade over unmet demands, highlighting ongoing socio-economic issues. Additionally, Nepal’s increasing reliance on remittances, record gold prices, and developments in agricultural exports to China underscore the country’s economic dynamics. Lastly, while the life insurance sector shows strong growth, the government faces challenges in ensuring consumer protection and addressing infrastructural funding shortfalls in provinces like Karnali. NEPSE rebounds: Index gains 23 points as market sentiment improves The Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) gained 23.03 points last week, ending a recent downturn that saw a loss of over Rs 378 billion. The index opened at 2,757.97 on Sunday and closed at 2,781 on Thursday, reaching a high of 2,824.85 and a low of 2,730.74. Ten out of the 13 market sectors saw gains, with the ‘Others’ sector rising by 4.57%. Bikash Hydropower saw a surge of 60.98%, while Narayani Development Bank dropped by 44.46%. Total turnover increased by 8.38% to Rs 32.26 billion, and market capitalization grew to Rs 4.647 trillion, leading to Rs 39 billion in investor gains. Nepal explores private sector entry into electricity trading to boost competition Following a report from the government task force, discussions have begun regarding the opening of Nepal’s electricity trading market to private sector participation. Currently dominated by Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), the proposal suggests that private companies could enhance competition and expand the market. If implemented, provisions under the Electricity Act 2049 would allow private producers to sell power domestically and internationally, potentially through platforms like NepEx or direct market channels. Experts believe that private sector involvement could fast-track development and improve consumer access to affordable, high-quality electricity. Heavy rain disrupts nine major highways across Nepal Heavy rainfall has led to landslides and flooding, blocking nine key highways in Nepal, the Nepal Police reported. The affected roads include the Koshi Highway at Bhotkhola (Sankhuwasabha), the Nepal-China bridge in Rasuwa, Pasang Lhamu Highway (Rasuwa), and Arniko Highway (Sindhupalchowk). Other impacted routes are the Kaligandaki Corridor (Baglung), Beni-Darbang road (Myagdi), Jajarkot road (Rukum Paschim), Bheri Corridor (Dolpa), and Gokuleshwor-Darchula road (Darchula). Some roads, such as parts of the Mid-Hill, Prithivi, and Kaligandaki corridors, remain open for one-way traffic. Authorities continue to monitor the ongoing situation as monsoon-related disruptions affect travel across the nation. NRB tightens rules on bank CSR funds: Transparent, targeted spending now mandatory Nepal Rastra Bank has introduced new regulations to ensure that corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds are used transparently and effectively by banks and financial institutions. Banks must allocate a fixed percentage of their net profit to CSR, with at least 60% spent within the fiscal year. Institutions are required to prepare annual action plans and submit semi-annual reports detailing their CSR activities. The funds can be used to support education, health, environmental protection, financial literacy, and skill development for targeted communities. Nepal advances plan to exit FATF grey list, showcases progress in Tokyo Nepal has officially begun steps to exit the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list after being included in February due to insufficient progress in combating money laundering and terrorism financing. At the Asia-Pacific Group (APG) plenary session in Tokyo, Nepal presented updates on its quarterly action plan. The Nepali delegation, led by PM Office Secretary Phanindra Gautam and Nepal Rastra Bank Deputy Governor Dr. Neelam Dhungana Timilsina, highlighted legal reforms, improved monitoring of high-risk sectors, and new coordination mechanisms. The government remains committed to implementing reforms to secure removal from the grey list. Sugarcane farmers threaten indefinite highway blockade from September 10 Sugarcane farmers from across Nepal, who have been protesting in the capital since August 24 over subsidies and government support, have warned of an indefinite blockade along the national highway in Hariwan, Sarlahi, beginning September 10 if their demands remain unmet. Protest coordinator Shyam Babu Ray emphasized that farmers had endured harsh conditions during the sit-in, yet their calls for help had been ignored. The protest, organized by the Sugarcane Producers Federation of Nepal, opposes subsidy cuts and seeks representation in price determination. Nepalis abroad send Rs 4.72 billion daily, driving record remittance inflows Nepali migrant workers sent a record Rs 1.72 trillion home in the last fiscal year, averaging Rs 4.72 billion daily, according to Nepal Rastra Bank. This represents a 19% year-on-year increase and nearly matches the government’s annual budget. The rise in remittances is attributed to increased outmigration, stronger foreign currencies like the US dollar, and a shift from informal to formal transfer channels. While remittances help uplift households, Nepal remains heavily dependent on foreign earnings due to a sluggish domestic economy and low investment levels. Nepal social media listing standoff: Companies resist due to content control rules Nepal’s Communication Minister Prithvi Subba Gurung has criticized social media giants like Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft for refusing to register under the country’s 2080 BS social media directive. Although these companies are registered for tax purposes, they resist the government’s listing due to concerns over strict content control rules. The directive mandates the removal of content within 24 hours of complaints, which has raised fears of excessive government intervention. The Asia Internet Coalition has highlighted the challenges in enforcing fair content review, and the government has issued a seven-day ultimatum for compliance. Life insurers collect Rs 3.27B in first premiums, Shrawan 2082/83 Nepal’s life insurance sector showed strong performance in Shrawan 2082/83, with companies collectively collecting over Rs 3.27 billion in first premiums. Nepal Life Insurance led the way with Rs 103 crore, followed by National Life (Rs 42.37 crore) and Citizen Life (Rs 25.01 crore). Other top performers included Himalayan Life, SuryaJyoti Life, LIC Nepal, and IME Life, reflecting strong investor interest and sector growth. Gold smashes Rs 200,000 mark in Nepal as prices soar Gold prices soared last week, crossing the Rs 200,000 per tola threshold for the first time, driven by global market trends. Prices rose by Rs 3,100, fluctuating between Rs 197,200 and Rs 200,600 per tola. The surge was driven by US interest rate cuts, a weaker Indian rupee, and increased gold purchases by China, India, and Turkey. Analysts see gold as a safe haven asset amidst market volatility. Silver prices also rose slightly, reaching Rs 2,360 per tola. Nepal seeks Chinese flexibility to boost agricultural exports Nepal has urged China to adopt flexible customs policies to ease exports of buffalo meat, dairy products, vegetables, fruits, and herbs. During a bilateral meeting in Kathmandu, Agriculture Minister Ramnath Adhikari and Chinese Customs Deputy Minister Wang Lingjun discussed the proposal. Nepal is seeking to export thermally processed buffalo meat, ghee, butter, silage, and animal feed, and has asked for concessions on citrus fruit standards. China has acknowledged Nepal’s priority status and agreed to establish a joint trade facilitation mechanism. Currently, 34 Nepali companies export agricultural products to China. IBN approves license draft for 669 MW Lower Arun Hydropower project Investment Board Nepal (IBN) has approved the draft license for the 669 MW Lower Arun Hydropower Project at its 66th meeting, chaired by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. The board also endorsed a draft for direct investment in the Arun-3 Hydropower Project in Sankhuwasabha and authorized the issuance of a survey license for the proposed ‘Auto Service Eco-Industrial Park’ project. The decision is seen as a step toward boosting Nepal’s energy sector. Karnali’s bridge projects face funding shortfall, pushed to multi-year plan The Karnali provincial government has allocated Rs 105 million for seven motorable bridges in Rukum West, but the funds are insufficient. Officials have proposed including the projects in a multi-year plan to secure additional funding. The Infrastructure Development Office in Chaurjahari submitted the proposal to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Urban Development, warning that the bridges might remain incomplete without timely approval. The lack of bridges in key areas is disrupting local travel, schooling, and livelihoods, especially during the monsoon. KMC fines distillery after fly found in sealed Mustang Gold bottle Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) has fined Dhanusha Distillery Pvt. Ltd. Rs 200,000 after a fly was found in a sealed bottle of its Mustang Gold alcoholic beverage. The fine follows a consumer complaint and an inspection by KMC’s Agriculture and Livestock Department. The department confirmed the presence of the inedible object after lab tests. KMC also inspected several other establishments, destroying inedible oil found in four restaurants and one sweet shop.

Title: Reframing Jensen’s Law: ‘Buy more, make more’ and AI factory economics

UPDATED 15:59 EDT / AUGUST 30 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante We believe the industry’s broad interpretation of Jensen’s Law — “Jensen’s Law accelerates Moore’s Law” — understates a fundamental economic reality of artificial intelligence factories. Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Jensen Huang’s own language and Nvidia’s operating model point to a financial law of motion for AI factories: When power is the binding constraint and demand is elastic, performance per watt increases raise monetizable throughput faster than they raise total cost. The result is an extension to existing laws of tech that we’ve come to know. Specifically, Huang’s invoking of Buy more to make more (that is, revenue up) and buy more to save more (unit cost down) has explicit economic implications that we believe need further examination. In addition, there is a corollary in this new regime in that, under certain conditions, fabric‑driven utilization unlocks are so valuable that high‑speed networking becomes “economically free” (where utilization gains exceed amortized fabric cost). In this Breaking Analysis, we explain in detail what we’re referring to as a new Jensen’s Law. We’ll explore why this phenomenon is so important, review the math behind it, share some concrete examples of where the law is applicable, when the corollary of “the network is free” holds, implications for investors and operators — and where the law is not applicable. Note on scope and conditions. Our interpretation of Jensen’s law applies primarily to power-limited AI factories operating at high utilization on communication-heavy training and long-context inference workloads, with elastic demand and operator-retained margins. Outside these conditions (for example, capex-limited or demand-limited sites or batchable inference, or where vendor rents are constrained by poor operating leverage), the relationship weakens or can even invert. In this research note, we refer to our interpretation of Jensen’s Law, Jensen’s law, the new Jensen’s law or true Jensen’s law and use them interchangeably. As we move beyond single-shot prompts, reasoning and agentic AI multiplies compute per task (100X-1,000X according to Nvidia and other sources). We hear all the time that data centers are increasingly power‑constrained. Nvidia’s GB300/NVLink 72/Spectrum‑X stack explicitly targets tokens per watt as the metric to optimize along with improving achieved utilization. The assumption is, together, these variables directly allow AI customers to monetize power‑limited factories. Remember, our interpretation of Jensen’s law assumes a new dollar of spend is worth it only if the lifetime extra revenue from better efficiency and utilization is bigger than the lifetime extra costs, after accounting for risk. With that as context, let’s look at some of the supporting statements from Nvidia’s Q2 FY2026 call on Aug. 27. The core of Jensen’s Law is that performance per watt drives revenue. In a power-limited data center, the number of tokens you can produce in a year is directly tied to how efficient you are. Or as Huang (pictured above) put it: “Performance per watt drives directly to revenues… the more you buy, the more you grow.” On the latest earnings call, Nvidia cited massive efficiency gains — 10 to 50 times more energy efficiency with GB300 versus Hopper, depending on configuration and the use of FP4 precision and NVLink 72. Nvidia gave no indications of workloads, configurations or levels of accuracy, which we’ll continue to research. Nonetheless, we heard concrete return-on-investment proof points. Nvidia cited an example where $3 million spend on GB200 infrastructure generated $30 million in token revenue. That’s a 10X return, presumably not a model, but actual operating data from the likes of Microsoft Corp. and OpenAI (not cited specifically). And networking is playing a much bigger role. Nvidia’s stack itself spans all three dimensions: NVLink for scale-up inside the rack, Spectrum-X Ethernet and InfiniBand for scale-out across clusters, and Spectrum-XGS for scale-across multisite AI factories. By lifting network utilization from about 65% toward 85% to 90%, the company argues that “networking is effectively free” because the throughput gain more than covers the fabric cost. Our interpretation here is networking can be economically free in communication-heavy environments where utilization gains are greater than fabric cost. Put in context with spending, Nvidia claims the “Big 4” hyperscalers (big three of Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, plus Meta Platforms Inc.) are on pace to spend about $600 billion this year on data centers, a figure we peg lower, at just north of $400 billion – nonetheless, still huge. Perhaps Nvidia is sizing the entire data center buildout spend, which still exceeds our estimates. Nvidia sizes the remaining decade’s AI infrastructure build at $3 trillion to $4 trillion, which also are significantly higher than our market projections — but still huge and this is the capex flywheel Jensen is pointing to. Perhaps Jensen has better visibility on demand than we do. The common usage in the press (for example, IEEE Spectrum, the WSJ, Tom’s Hardware and others) positions “Jensen’s Law” as Nvidia’s acceleration beyond Moore’s Law — shorter cycles and outsized generation‑over‑generation gains. That’s directionally spot on, but we want to put a finer point on the law. In our view, the missing lever is one of economics. Our premise today is there’s a version of Jensen’s Law that is more than just marketing and it relates to the economics of AI Factories. Let’s review the core principle that’s emerging in the economics of AI factories. In a power-limited environment, every incremental dollar of spend that improves performance per watt and fabric efficiency drives monetizable throughput — tokens per second — faster than it raises total cost. That dynamic leads to two outcomes: Further, when utilization gains at the fabric level are significant, high-speed networking becomes economically free. The throughput lift outweighs the amortized cost of the networking gear. This of course is dependent on the existing utilization assumptions, the workload and the potential gains in utilization. This framing ties directly back to some of the classic laws of technology economics as shown on the right-hand side of the graphic above. What’s new is that these principles are being operationalized specifically for power-limited AI factories, and we’re anchoring them with explicit revenue math, which we’ll share shortly. That’s the shift — moving from abstract laws of progress to concrete, financial drivers of the AI economy. It might be helpful to review these classical laws, and we’ll tie them into our new interpretation of Jensen’s Law. The following is a brief summary of the laws shown above and the role they play in the new Jensen’s Law as we’ve described: Moore’s Law: speaks to device scaling and feeds the performance/watt gains – that is, the more tokens you can produce per year at a fixed power envelope the better the economics. Wright’s Law: cost declines by a constant as cumulative volume doubles – this explains the cost/token falling a deployments scale – core to the “save more” side of the equation. Metcalfe’s Law: value grows exponentially as a function of connectivity. This speaks to the network utilization – scale up, scale out, scale across, making networking economically “free.” Jevons’ Paradox: efficiency increases consumption and supports the flywheel effects of Jensen’s Law as we’ve defined it. Let’s break down the math behind our interpretation of this new Jensen’s Law. We can boil it down to three things: how many tokens you can generate, how much revenue those tokens produce, and what each token costs to make. Start with throughput — tokens per year. That’s a function of four variables: the power budget, the amount of operating time in a year, the efficiency of the system — meaning tokens per unit of energy — and how well you can utilize the cluster. Put those together, and the formula is as follows: [Tokens per year = power X efficiency X utilization.] Once you know throughput, revenue is just a matter of multiplying tokens by dollars per token. That gives you the top line. [Revenue = tokens X dollars per token.] Now let’s look at the cost side of the equation. Cost per token is your total annualized expense — servers, racks, networking, cooling, electricity, staff, real estate — divided by tokens per year. In other words, take capex plus energy plus other operating expenses and spread it across your token output. [Cost per token = capex (annualized) + energy costs + other opex​/annual token output.] Finally, gross margin. That’s one minus cost per token over price per token. Put simply, the more efficient you are at generating tokens and keeping the system utilized, the more your margin expands. [1-cost per token/price per token.] So when we say performance per watt times utilization equals revenue, this is the math. It’s not just a marketing slogan when the conditions are right, rather it’s a financial model for AI factories. Here’s a simplified graphic that lays this out more clearly: Jensen’s economic argument for networking goes something like this: If you buy more on a faster fabric, better cooling, or smarter software and it improves efficiency or utilization enough, then the extra revenue from more tokens will outweigh the extra cost of that upgrade. If efficiency and utilization gains are greater than the added costs…buy more, make more applies, because cost per token also falls… leading to buy more, save more. When efficiency cuts unit cost, you can charge less per token. If demand is elastic (customers want more when it’s cheaper), revenue grows even faster — reinforcing the Jensen flywheel as we discussed earlier. Let’s put this in a picture and look at the value flow of Jensen’s Law – “Follow the Money.” To do so,we’ll put our version of Jensen’s Law in plain language. Think of an AI factory like a cafeteria. The cafeteria has ovens (GPUs), cooks (software) and a delivery system (networking). The point is to serve as many meals (tokens) as possible every day, while keeping costs low and making money. Here’s the flow shown in the chart above: So the new Jensen’s Law is: Buy more to upgrade the cafeteria, and you’ll either serve more meals (make more) or serve each meal cheaper (save more). If both happen, your profit gets a double whammy. Networking fits right in. Better networking is like upgrading the cafeteria’s conveyor belts so every oven stays busy. Even if conveyor belts cost extra, they pay for themselves because the cafeteria serves way more meals. That’s why Nvidia says the “network is free.” The loop on the right is the accretive-spend rule. It means: So the test is: Does the revenue uplift from higher efficiency/utilization outweigh the added cost of the upgrade? The key is you have to take a systems view, which is something that Jensen always stresses – “we’re don’t just build chips, we build systems.” This is a key part of Nvidia’s moat, which is underappreciated in our view. If one part of the system is optimized (for example, more ovens create more meals) but the conveyor belt is not fast enough then the system is out of balance and revenue is not maximized. Nvidia’s Q2 results included some proof points for our interpretation of Jensen’s Law. The company gave several examples showing how new architectures and fabrics translate directly into revenue multiples and lower costs per token. Below is our take on some of those. First, reasoning and agentic AI: Unlike simple chatbots, these agents plan, use tools and iterate. That makes workloads 100 to 1,000 times more compute-intensive, which means efficiency and utilization gains matter a lot more. A key question to ask here is how is Nvidia accounting for utilization? For example, how does the calculation account for multi-tenant overheads, queueing efficiency, I/O fragmentation and restarts? Second, GB300 with NVLink 72: At rack scale, it delivers about 10X the tokens per watt compared to Hopper. With four-bit floating point math, energy efficiency improves up to 50X per token. CoreWeave Inc. says it’s already seeing 10X better inference on reasoning models in production. We’d be interested in details around what tokenization standards are most productive? What Quality of Service limits (if any) were in place to achieve these 10X to 50X claims? Third, the fabric story: Networking isn’t a side note, it’s fundamental to the economics. Spectrum-X Ethernet is already running at a $10 billion rate, and NVLink 72 gives you 14X the bandwidth of PCIe Gen5. That’s why Jensen says the network is effectively free — because if utilization gains outweigh the cost – it is economically free. We’d like to understand this further in terms of what reasonable incremental revenue over the fabric costs would constitute “free.” In other words, what kind of save NPV:Fabric TCO ratio should operators assume to achieve that economic freedom? Is it 1X? 2X? 3X – what is a reasonable cushion to guarantee results? Fourth, the $3 million to $30 million example. Jensen cited a real case where a $3 million spend on infrastructure produced $30 million in token revenue. That’s the “buy more, make more” flywheel in action. Key questions we have include: What was the time window in which this benefit was achieved – i.e. is this a snapshot benefit or one that is sustainable over a period of time? What were the price/token assumptions? What’s a reasonable range of benefit (we assume 10X is a best case scenario for marketing purposes)? And finally, cadence. Nvidia is shipping new architectures every year — Blackwell to Rubin and beyond. Each one drives higher performance per watt, higher utilization and higher revenue. It’s compounding economics. A key issue we see here is if a new Nvidia generation hits before I realize my payback (for example, I hit delays which is a clear risk) and the value of my infrastructure tanks I’m left with a failed business case and will get fired. We see this as especially pressing as AI moves from hyperscale/cloud to enterprise and edge. Bottom line: Nvidia isn’t just selling chips; it’s proving the economic engine of our version of Jensen’s Law. Heavier workloads drive the value of efficiency improvements higher, fabrics keep the graphics processing units busy, and each architecture turn compounds the “buy more, make more” cycle. But operators and enterprise customers must cut through the marketing hype, understand their unique environment and how Nvidia’s impressive claims translate into value for them. We were somewhat surprised by investor reaction to Nvidia’s latest earnings print. Other than a hit to free cash flow margin, we thought the quarter was quite remarkable. And Nvidia addressed the free cash flow in comments about its days sales outstanding, which to us was of no concern. From an investor perspective, Jensen’s Law changes four things in our view as bulleted above and described in more detail below. First, the unit of competition is no longer the chip, it’s the AI factory. What matters is system-level performance per watt and utilization, which rewards rack-scale designs, integrated fabrics, software and cadence. Second, networking isn’t overhead, it can be a profit lever. Utilization gains are so significant that fabric routinely pays for itself — often multiple times over. The caveat is the conditions have to be right. They are today for the large hyperscalers. Will this translate to mainstream enterprises to the same degree? Third, pricing power is being redefined by elasticity. If elasticity exists, as cost per token collapses, providers can still grow revenue by lowering prices, because demand expands even faster. Note: Operators must take the risk that elasticity is greater than 1 (that is, as price drops customers will buy enough to grow revenue). We’re seeing some positive signs in the scramble for capacity and the shift to reasoning workloads – indicating an insatiable appetite for AI services. The caveat here is price per token is ever-changing and very quickly. Often it’s a race to zero between API pricing, free tiers, price cuts, advertising subsidies and the like. The operator’s margin will be affected by these dynamics, which can alter the outcome. And fourth, cadence is a cash machine. Nvidia’s product cadence isn’t just about faster chips, it’s about turning capital spending into a recurring monetization flywheel. Each year, new architectures deliver higher efficiency (more tokens per watt) and better utilization (keeping clusters busier). That combination means every dollar of capex spent on GPUs, networking, and racks generates more revenue in the following cycle. But a key consideration for investors is the degree to which customers can move at the speed of Nvidia. Clearly the hyperscalers and Meta, X.ai, the neoclouds and some service providers can keep up. But mainstream enterprises will struggle to maintain pace. If and when the capex gusher dries up, enterprises and new uses cases like robotics will be the growth engine. The dynamics in these markets will be different. Nonetheless, in today’s hyperscale-led market this is what Jensen means when he says: “the more you buy, the more you grow.” Customers that continually reinvest ride the curve of annual improvements, effectively compounding returns with each generation. We believe this flywheel is in place until the end of this decade at least. Here’s how we think operators should measure Jensen’s Law in the field. First, tokens per joule — true efficiency is rising fast, 10 to 50 times in some cases. Second, utilization — some operators claim clusters run 15% to 25% more efficiently with NVLink 72 and Spectrum-X. Third, power allocation — when the megawatt cap can be flat, every gain in performance per watt drops straight to revenue. Fourth, token price and demand — as price falls, demand rises, and so does revenue (Jevons’ Paradox) Fifth, payback time — some builds now recover in under a year. And finally, fabric mix — NVLink 72 domains are scaling, and XGS (data center to data center) is just starting to emerge. We believe the AI factory math is compelling, but only under strict operating conditions. Jensen’s new Law isn’t guaranteed. There are risks and conditions where it may not hold. First, if a data center isn’t power-limited, then performance per watt isn’t as tightly tied to revenue. Second, if token prices fall faster than efficiency and utilization rise, growth stalls — especially if demand isn’t elastic. Third, workloads matter. If the model isn’t sensitive to fabric speed or collective operations, the return on fabric spend moderates. Fourth, practical constraints like supply chain delays, power or cooling bottlenecks can push out the payoff. Fifth, If alternative stacks or application-specific integrated circuits start to match Nvidia’ end-to-end efficiency, then the economics begin to normalize. The following specific details should be monitored over time in our view: Efficiency claims of 10X to 50X must be validated end-to-end, taking into consideration tokens per joule at accuracy and latency parity. This should be measured at the system level, not on a single GPU. Further, business cases should assume headroom with returns of 3X to 5X over cost to account for the risks. Utilization uplift is equally nuanced. Gains of 15 to 25 points from NVLink 72 and Spectrum-X are real for collective-heavy training and long-context inference, but may be negligible on parallel inference. Operators should expect meaningful sustained improvement over many weeks under production load before scaling. Remember, performance per watt only translates to revenue if power is the binding constraint. If capacity is capped by capex or demand, the linkage weakens. In our opinion, upgrades should proceed only when power will be a constraint for 12 to 24 months. Have high confidence that incremental throughput will be consumed – or ideally is presold. Elasticity assumptions must be grounded. Revenue uplift from price cuts applies only where elasticity is greater than 1. Otherwise, protect margins with tiered QoS. Similarly, sub-year paybacks depend on high utilization, stable token pricing and on-time installations. Our research indicates many investments face unforeseen delays. Assume higher internal rate of return/hurdle rates and longer payback periods in business cases. Operators must retain margin uplifts. In our view, upgrades are accretive only when power is constrained, utilization lifts are proven, demand is elastic, and the surplus accrues to the operator —not only to the infrastructure supplier. Finally, this interpretation of Jensen’s Law works well for hyperscalers and consumer Internet companies. It’s unclear how well it translates to enterprise AI and edge customers. We’ll dig into that as those markets evolve. These are the stress points we need to watch. Hopefully our reframe of Jensen’s Law is clear. The shorthand of “Moore’s Law on steroids” is catchy but incomplete. The economics show that in power-limited AI factories, efficiency (tokens per joule) and utilization (keeping clusters busy) are the true revenue levers. When those improve faster than costs rise, two dynamics follow: Buy more to make more, and buy more to save more. Earnings calls continue to supply supporting evidence: Nvidia cites 10X to 50X efficiency gains, examples of $3 million in infrastructure yielding $30 million in token revenue, and fabric-driven utilization lifts that can make networking effectively free. But we caution that these outcomes only hold under strict conditions —measured end-to-end at the system level, with sustained utilization improvements, when power is truly the limiting constraint; and where demand elasticity supports revenue growth rather than price erosion. For investors and operators, the actionable takeaway is to judge vendors by factory economics, not chip specs alone. The durable winners will be those who compound efficiency and utilization year after year, with software and fabrics carrying as much weight as silicon — while ensuring the efficiency margins accrue to the operator, not just the supplier.

A round-up of the biggest tech-related news that stood out this week. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. News Weekly is our column where we highlight and summarize some of the week's top stories so you can catch up on the latest tech news. This is Android Central's News Weekly, your go-to source for a concise roundup of the week's most significant tech stories. This is where we delve into the top headlines that provide the latest developments and innovations contributing to the digital landscape. This week, Samsung announced another Unpacked event, a Pixel 10 battery feature you can't turn off, Nothing gets caught in the middle of a stock photo scandal, Samsung XR headset's launch could be on the horizon, and everything we know so far about the upcoming Galaxy S25 FE. Read more here Samsung announced this week that it will launch another set of devices soon at its Virtual Unpacked event on Sept 4 at 5 p.m. ET. We may have an idea of what is ahead of us, considering the leaks that have been coming in; however, the teaser hints at nothing more than the arrival of "new" devices. So far, we've had official launches for the Galaxy Buds 3 FE and the Galaxy Tab S10 Lite. Both products have joined Samsung's budget-friendly offerings, and they will also be showcased during this event. Additionally, we've been seeing rumors about a Galaxy S25 FE, another budget phone, as well as the Galaxy Tab S11, along with an alleged Ultra version. We have a pretty packed lineup ahead of us, and the curtain rises next week! Those interested can watch from the Samsung Newsroom, Samsung.com, or the company's YouTube channel. Read more here Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Google's new flagship is here, but here's the catch: apparently, this time around, the tech giant says the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro/XL have a battery feature that's locked and loaded onto the device that users can't disable. The feature called "Battery Health Assistance," introduced on the Google Pixel 9a, is designed to slow down your battery's aging by reducing charging speed and voltage. This feature activates after 200 charge cycles on the Pixel 10 series. Google claims this slow adjustment helps the battery age more evenly and maintain stable performance over time. While this should make your battery last longer, it will also gradually lower your phone's charging speed. This means your device would need to be plugged into the charger for longer, which is a bummer. Read more here Nothing has been caught in the middle of a messy controversy over its marketing of the Phone 3. The tech company was recently spotted using stock images by professional photographers on different cameras, as shots taken on the Phone 3. Android Authority seems to have narrowed down five images that were supposedly captured by their new flagship devices, but were actually licensed photos. The images in question were licensed stock photos and not, as the company stated, "what our community has captured with the Phone (3)." Android Central also received an anonymous tip that showcased a screen recording of a Live Demo Unit (LDU) and screenshots of images reportedly taken by the device. The tipster claimed that these images were not authentic, but rather stock photos, backing their claim with links to the Stills platform. Akis Evangelidis, the co-founder of Nothing, took to X to post a lengthy statement, effectively agreeing to the fact that these images were indeed stock photographs, but he clarified that this was an "unfortunate oversight." Read more here According to a new report (via UploadVR and Google Translate), Samsung will allegedly hold a Galaxy Unpacked event in Korea on September 29, where it'll finally launch Samsung's long-awaited project Moohan. The headset recently passed through certification at the Korea Testing & Research Institute, and will launch "sequentially in global markets" starting in Korea on October 13. As for its price, the report claims the headset could cost around 4 million won, or 1 million short of the Apple Vision Pro. Depending on regional pricing, which is about $1,799 to $2,999, putting it well above the Meta Quest 3. We were able to demo Project Moohan at Google I/O, and it basically exceeded expectations with its "immersive visuals and natural navigation through apps via Gemini voice commands. It felt comfortably balanced with a knob fitting it in place, gesture controls were seamless, and app performance was speedy," AC's Senior Editor Michael Hicks added. Read more here A German publication, Nieuwe Mobiel, spotted an early online listing of the alleged Samsung Galaxy S25 FE on a Portuguese website. The website named MediaMarkt uploaded an entire product page for the Galaxy S25 FE, ahead of its alleged Sept. 4 launch. The page, now taken down, allegedly featured official-looking posters that provided more than enough information on what to expect from the phone. Nieuwe Mobiel was quick enough to download all the images and notes that the S25 FE is expected to be "thinner and lighter. The phone is said to feature a 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED display, measuring 7.4mm in width and weighing approximately 190 grams, which is around 20 grams lighter than its predecessor. The images show the alleged Fan edition in a "Navy Blue" colorway, with noticeably thinner bezels around the screen. Other specifications of the device are expected to include a triple camera array and thinner bezels. Those are some of the biggest stories from this week.

Dave Smith is a writer and editor who previously has been published in Business Insider, Newsweek, ABC News, and USA TODAY. Apple’s September 9 “Awe Dropping” event, announced earlier this week, arrives at a critical moment for one of the world’s most valuable companies as it seeks to maintain momentum following strong third-quarter earnings that delivered record revenue of $94 billion. The event, scheduled for 1 p.m. Eastern at Apple’s Cupertino, Calif. headquarters, represents the opening phase of a reported three-year transformation strategy, according to Bloomberg‘s Mark Gurman, that’s designed to reinvent Apple’s hardware ecosystem. The timing carries particular significance as Apple faces mounting challenges in artificial intelligence, where the company has struggled to keep pace with competitors and recently faced an antitrust lawsuit from Elon Musk’s xAI over alleged AI monopolization. Apple’s stock has been hit particularly hard, declining roughly 15-19% so far in 2025, making it the one of the worst performers among the Magnificent Seven tech stocks. The stock lost roughly $75 billion in market value during Apple’s WWDC 2025 keynote in June when the company acknowledged its AI-powered Siri upgrade would be delayed until the following year. Despite these headwinds, Apple’s recent financial performance has shown resilience, with iPhone revenue surging 13.5% to $44.6 billion in the third quarter, partly driven by customers upgrading ahead of potential tariff increases. The September event’s product lineup directly addresses Apple’s strategic priorities by introducing hardware designed to integrate with the company’s Liquid Glass design language: a translucent, depth-focused interface that represents the company’s most significant visual overhaul since iOS 7 in 2013. This design system, inspired by the Vision Pro headset, establishes a unified aesthetic across Apple’s platforms while preparing users for expanded spatial-computing capabilities. The centerpiece of Apple’s September 9 event will reportedly be the ultra-thin iPhone 17 “Air,” which would be the first time an iPhone is bestowed with the moniker that was so popular with Apple’s MacBook line two decades ago. The “Air” model is expected to replace the underperforming iPhone Plus in Apple’s product lineup. The device will reportedly measure approximately 5.5mm at its thinnest point, making it significantly thinner than the iPhone 16’s 7.8mm profile and in all likelihood, given the rumored name, the thinnest iPhone ever made. You can see what it looks like in mock-ups here. The iPhone 17 Air is said to feature a 6.6-inch display supporting 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates, which would be the first time non-Pro iPhones to have this feature that makes your iPhone screen look and feel buttery smooth. The device is rumored to sport a hybrid titanium-aluminum frame and weigh approximately 145 grams, substantially lighter than the iPhone 16 Pro’s 199 grams. However, the ultra-thin design apparently means some compromises. The phone will reportedly only include a single 48-megapixel rear camera and a smaller battery compared to last year’s flagship iPhones. The USB-C port placement is also said to be off-center, and speaker grilles have been simplified to accommodate the slim profile. Color options reportedly include black, white, light gold, and a light blue shade similar to the MacBook Air. Pricing is expected to match the current iPhone Plus at $899. The standard iPhone 17 is rumored to have a better 24-megapixel front-facing camera that doubles the resolution of current models. All iPhone 17 models will reportedly feature ProMotion 120Hz displays, extending this previously Pro-exclusive feature across the entire lineup. The iPhone 17 Pro models will reportedly showcase a new pill-shaped camera bump that’s larger than previous designs, including a 48-megapixel telephoto lens with up to 8x optical zoom; the iPhone 16 Pro is only capable of 5x optical zoom. The Pro models will also transition to primarily aluminum backs instead of glass, improving durability while reducing weight. Color options for the Pro models will reportedly include a pair of new colors hinted at in Apple’s invitations: orange and blue, as well as the more traditional black, white, and silver options. The event’s thermal-inspired logo appears to reference both the new colors and the rumored vapor chamber cooling system designed to prevent overheating during intensive tasks. The Apple Watch Series 11 will apparently emphasize health-monitoring improvements, potentially introducing blood-pressure trend tracking capabilities—though not full systolic and diastolic readings. The feature would detect hypertension patterns and alert users to consult health care professionals. The Series 11 will reportedly come with an updated S11 chip that may be smaller in design to accommodate larger batteries or additional sensors. The watch may also gain 5G RedCap connectivity from MediaTek, according to MacRumors, which would provide faster data speeds than current LTE-only models. The Apple Watch Ultra 3 will reportedly be the first Apple Watch with standalone satellite connectivity, according to Bloomberg‘s Mark Gurman. This feature will enable emergency SOS functionality and potentially text messaging in remote areas without cellular or Wi-Fi coverage. The Ultra 3 is also said to include improved 5G connectivity, and the biggest Apple Watch display to-date, which is said to be brighter and better when viewing it from side angles. And an improved charging coil could enable 80% charging in 30 minutes, according to MacRumors. Apple’s third-generation AirPods Pro will reportedly introduce heart-rate monitoring capabilities, using LED optical sensors that can track your heart rate through blood flow in the ear canal. Beyond health features, the AirPods Pro 3 will include improved Active Noise Cancellation, enhanced sound quality, and a faster H3 audio chip. Some reports suggest potential temperature monitoring capabilities and real-time translation features. The new model will feature design refinements including a slimmer form factor and concealed status LED. The September 9 event establishes groundwork for Apple’s long-term vision, with 2026 expected to bring the company’s first foldable iPhone and 2027 potentially introducing an all-glass design for the iPhone’s 20th anniversary. This three-year transformation roadmap represents Apple’s most ambitious hardware strategy since the original iPhone launch, designed to address mounting competitive pressures and position the company for the next decade. The foldable iPhone is reportedly scheduled for fall 2026 and is rumored to follow a book-style design similar to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold series, reportedly featuring a 7.8-inch inner display and 5.5-inch outer screen. The device will reportedly include four cameras, Touch ID instead of Face ID to save internal space, and Apple’s second-generation cellular modem. Analysts predict a starting price around $2,000, positioning it as Apple’s most expensive smartphone to date. The 2027 “iPhone 20” represents an even more radical departure, featuring four-sided curved glass that eliminates bezels entirely and creates what Bloomberg describes as a “mostly glass, curved iPhone without any cutouts.” This design aligns directly with Apple’s Liquid Glass interface introduced in iOS 26, which emphasizes translucency, depth, and spatial-computing elements inspired by the Vision Pro. The curved-glass approach would fulfill former design chief Jony Ive’s long-held vision of creating a device that appears like “a single sheet of glass.” These hardware advances directly support Apple’s spatial computing ambitions, with CEO Tim Cook reportedly “hell bent” on launching true AR glasses before Meta can achieve the same milestone. Cook has reportedly made AR glasses his “top priority,” with one Apple engineer stating “Tim cares about nothing else” from a product-development standpoint. The company’s roadmap reportedly includes lightweight AR glasses expected in 2027, along with multiple Vision Pro iterations through 2028. Apple’s Vision Pro roadmap includes a small power refresh by the end of 2025, followed by a lighter “Vision Air” model in 2027 that may be up to 40% lighter than the current version. The company is also developing smart glasses similar to Meta’s Ray-Bans as an interim solution while perfecting true AR technology. These products collectively aim to achieve Apple’s goal of shipping over 10 million AR/VR products annually by 2027. The strategic timing aligns with Apple’s broader effort to diversify beyond the iPhone while maintaining its premium market position. Features like iOS 26’s 3D photo effects and spatial interface elements serve as stepping stones toward mainstream AR adoption, gradually acclimating users to spatial-computing concepts before introducing dedicated AR hardware. This measured approach allows Apple to build ecosystem readiness while competitors like Meta and Google rush to market with potentially premature products. Apple’s “Awe Dropping” event will livestream on the company’s website, YouTube, and Apple TV, on Tuesday, September 9. Based on past iPhone launch events, where Apple holds the event on a Tuesday, pre-orders typically begin that Friday with general availability launching on week later: In this case, that would mean pre-orders opening on September 12 and at least some of the new iPhones launching on September 19. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Manage your account ... Apple may unveil as many as seven new products at its September 9 “Awe Dropping” event, including the ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air that could replace the iPhone Plus line. The company is also expected to introduce health-focused updates across its Apple Watch and AirPods lineups, marking a significant hardware refresh amid ongoing challenges in artificial intelligence competition.

The feature would detect hypertension patterns and alert users to consult health care professionals. The Series 11 will reportedly come with an updated S11 chip that may be smaller in design to accommodate larger batteries or additional sensors. The watch may also gain 5G RedCap connectivity from MediaTek, according to MacRumors, which would provide faster data speeds than current LTE-only models. The Apple Watch Ultra 3 will reportedly be the first Apple Watch with standalone satellite connectivity, according to Bloomberg‘s Mark Gurman. This feature will enable emergency SOS functionality and potentially text messaging in remote areas without cellular or Wi-Fi coverage. The Ultra 3 is also said to include improved 5G connectivity, and the biggest Apple Watch display to-date, which is said to be brighter and better when viewing it from side angles. And an improved charging coil could enable 80% charging in 30 minutes, according to MacRumors. Apple’s third-generation AirPods Pro will reportedly introduce heart-rate monitoring capabilities, using LED optical sensors that can track your heart rate through blood flow in the ear canal. Beyond health features, the AirPods Pro 3 will include improved Active Noise Cancellation, enhanced sound quality, and a faster H3 audio chip. Some reports suggest potential temperature monitoring capabilities and real-time translation features. The new model will feature design refinements including a slimmer form factor and concealed status LED. The September 9 event establishes groundwork for Apple’s long-term vision, with 2026 expected to bring the company’s first foldable iPhone and 2027 potentially introducing an all-glass design for the iPhone’s 20th anniversary. This three-year transformation roadmap represents Apple’s most ambitious hardware strategy since the original iPhone launch, designed to address mounting competitive pressures and position the company for the next decade. The foldable iPhone is reportedly scheduled for fall 2026 and is rumored to follow a book-style design similar to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold series, reportedly featuring a 7.8-inch inner display and 5.5-inch outer screen. The device will reportedly include four cameras, Touch ID instead of Face ID to save internal space, and Apple’s second-generation cellular modem. Analysts predict a starting price around $2,000, positioning it as Apple’s most expensive smartphone to date. The 2027 “iPhone 20” represents an even more radical departure, featuring four-sided curved glass that eliminates bezels entirely and creates what Bloomberg describes as a “mostly glass, curved iPhone without any cutouts.” This design aligns directly with Apple’s Liquid Glass interface introduced in iOS 26, which emphasizes translucency, depth, and spatial-computing elements inspired by the Vision Pro. The curved-glass approach would fulfill former design chief Jony Ive’s long-held vision of creating a device that appears like “a single sheet of glass.” These hardware advances directly support Apple’s spatial computing ambitions, with CEO Tim Cook reportedly “hell bent” on launching true AR glasses before Meta can achieve the same milestone. Cook has reportedly made AR glasses his “top priority,” with one Apple engineer stating “Tim cares about nothing else” from a product-development standpoint. The company’s roadmap reportedly includes lightweight AR glasses expected in 2027, along with multiple Vision Pro iterations through 2028. Apple’s Vision Pro roadmap includes a small power refresh by the end of 2025, followed by a lighter “Vision Air” model in 2027 that may be up to 40% lighter than the current version. The company is also developing smart glasses similar to Meta’s Ray-Bans as an interim solution while perfecting true AR technology. These products collectively aim to achieve Apple’s goal of shipping over 10 million AR/VR products annually by 2027. The strategic timing aligns with Apple’s broader effort to diversify beyond the iPhone while maintaining its premium market position. Features like iOS 26’s 3D photo effects and spatial interface elements serve as stepping stones toward mainstream AR adoption, gradually acclimating users to spatial-computing concepts before introducing dedicated AR hardware. This measured approach allows Apple to build ecosystem readiness while competitors like Meta and Google rush to market with potentially premature products. Apple’s “Awe Dropping” event will livestream on the company’s website, YouTube, and Apple TV, on Tuesday, September 9. Based on past iPhone launch events, where Apple holds the event on a Tuesday, pre-orders typically begin that Friday with general availability launching on week later: In this case, that would mean pre-orders opening on September 12 and at least some of the new iPhones launching on September 19.

BitMine Immersion Technologies saw its stock sink nearly 8% this week, yet that didn’t stop Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest from pouring another $15.6 million into the company. The latest move comes during a period of heightened volatility in both equities and crypto markets. According to ARK’s trading disclosures on August 27, the firm bought 339,113 BitMine shares spread across three ETFs. The ARK Innovation ETF acquired 227,569 shares valued at a little over $10 million, while the Next Generation Internet ETF added 70,991 shares worth $3.27 million. The Fintech Innovation ETF purchased another 40,553 shares for $1.87 million. Despite this fresh round of buying, BitMine shares ended the day at $46 before sliding 7.80% in extended trading. Cathie Wood and Ark Invest bought 339,113 shares of Tom Lee’s $BMNR today pic.twitter.com/G9SQY02rDg — Tom Lee Tracker (@TomLeeTracker) August 28, 2025 BitMine’s pivot from Bitcoin mining to an Ethereum-focused treasury earlier this summer has transformed the firm into a major corporate player in crypto. Its balance sheet now holds 1,714,000 ETH, worth about $8.20 billion, alongside 192 Bitcoin and $562 million in cash. That makes BitMine the world’s largest corporate holder of Ethereum. Billionaire investor Peter Thiel has also taken a 9% stake, adding more weight to the firm’s rapid rise. According to latest data, the company’s strategy has fueled sharp price movements in its stock. After surging more than 3,000% to a record high of $135 in early July, shares remain up more than 400% year-to-date despite recent pullbacks. Reports have disclosed that BitMine dramatically expanded its fundraising plans. On August 12, the company filed to boost its at-the-market equity offering from $2 billion to $24.5 billion, a move led by Cantor Fitzgerald and ThinkEquity. Observers say the new funds will give BitMine more firepower to build its Ethereum position. Analysts projected strong gains for Ethereum, predicting $5,500 in the near term and as high as $12,000 by year-end. If those targets materialize and BitMine pushes toward its 5% supply goal, the company could one day rival Michael Saylor’s Strategy in scale. Social media reaction has been quick to frame BitMine as Ethereum’s version of Strategy — a corporate vehicle for institutional exposure to the asset. ARK’s growing position, surpassing $200 million this summer, only strengthens that concept. Yet the risks are just as visible. BitMine’s share price swings highlight how concentrated bets can move violently, even with billions of dollars on the balance sheet.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Good morning from a wet and gloomy London. It's been a real pleasure writing to you each day, but I'm delighted to say your usual host, Dan DeFrancesco, returns from parental leave next week. Not to worry, this isn't quite goodbye. I'll be back in your inbox on Labor Day, and I'll continue working behind the scenes on this newsletter. Oh, and do keep in touch — whether it's feedback, questions, or recommendations for a decent pint in London. I'm at your service. Now, on to today's big story: BI's Jyoti Mann exclusively reports on Meta's race against time to launch one of its latest products. What's on deck: Markets: The brands Morgan Stanley's summer interns are splurging on. Tech: Here's who stands to benefit — and who might suffer — from the AI software shakeout. Business: Dollar General is racing to grow its one hour delivery service. But first, the clock is ticking. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Meta is in a race against time. And there's not long left on the clock. Meta's Superintelligence Labs is under pressure to release one of its first projects by year-end, according to insiders who spoke with BI. This team has been one to watch. Assembled with urgency, Mark Zuckerberg spared no expense, cherry-picking the very best talent. In June, Meta spent a staggering $14 billion to acquire nearly half of Scale AI — then promptly put its 28-year-old cofounder in charge of the Superintelligence push. That's just the tip of the iceberg. Meta has reportedly dangled compensation packages worth hundreds of millions to lure elite researchers from companies like OpenAI and Google DeepMind. But that strategy has rubbed some Meta employees the wrong way. As one former Meta researcher said, watching outsiders walk in with 10 to 50 times the compensation made some longtime staff feel like failures. Unsurprisingly, tensions are flaring. Some workers are threatening to jump ship to rivals. Others say they will quit on the spot to try to force Meta into negotiations. And so, less than two months after its launch, the cracks are beginning to show in Meta's Superintelligence Labs. At least eight employees have already left — including some who'd barely unpacked. Two OpenAI engineers reportedly lasted less than a month. We've seen the superstar hires. We've seen the eye-watering price tags. What we haven't seen? Results. When Meta rolled out its Llama 4 AI models in April, the crowd went mild. Developers felt it underdelivered in key areas like coding, reasoning, and following instructions. Now, BI's Jyoti Mann exclusively reports that the team is scrambling to fix the bugs, revive the product, and ship the next-gen release: Llama 4.X. Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London.

Title: Strengthening the sustainability of neglected tropical disease programs in Rwanda: An assessment of access and utilization of domestically-financed services for soil-transmitted helminthiases and schistosomiasis
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371

Full Content:
Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) and schistosomiasis (SCH) infections remain some of the most prevalent neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), causing significant morbidity in most of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), including Rwanda. With dwindling international funding for NTD services and recent commitments focused on other diseases considered easier to eliminate as a public health problem, it is essential to assess domestic financing sources’ scale, efficiency, and effectiveness. The study aims to strengthen domestic efforts towards sustainable financing for neglected tropical disease programs in Africa, particularly in Rwanda. Up to 235 patients from 24 health centers in four districts of Rwanda were sampled for this survey. The districts selected had the highest number of STH and SCH based on routine data from June 2021 to December 2022, which is the window period of the study. We estimated affordability using the lowest-paid government worker (LPGW) and then compared this with household income and expenditure obtained from patients participating in the survey. Data was collected from August to September 2023. Limited secondary data were collected to complement primary data. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to present the findings. The most available drugs were mebendazole, with 100% of facilities reporting no stockout. Praziquantel (PZQ) was the most unavailable drug, reporting 92% stockout at the time of the survey, mainly due to delays in getting supplies from MDA-implementing health facilities. Diagnostics for SCH are the most inaccessible lab services. On average, the total cost (both direct and opportunity cost) to access and utilize STH and SCH services was USD 0.72 (RWF 861.92) and USD 0.96 (RWF 1136.41) for male and female patients, respectively. Although the assessment revealed that treatment for STH and SCH was affordable for the LPGW, women pay a 33% higher cost than men to access NTD services. While services are generally satisfactory, the reimbursement processes are slow, hindering timely access and utilization of SCH and STH services at the health facilities in Rwanda. While the access and utilization of STH and SCH services in health centers are generally promising, the findings underscore the potential for improvement. By addressing the efficiency in the supply of praziquantel drugs and enhancing reimbursement timelines, we can ensure the continuity and effectiveness of these services, offering hope for a brighter future in the fight against neglected tropical diseases. This study explores how Rwanda is working to sustainably finance healthcare services for two neglected tropical diseases—soil-transmitted helminths (STH) and schistosomiasis (SCH)—as international aid for such diseases declines. The research surveyed 235 patients across 24 health centers in districts most affected by these conditions, focusing on how accessible, affordable, and well-utilized these services are under Rwanda’s domestic health financing mechanisms. Key findings show that while basic medications like mebendazole are widely available, others like praziquantel face frequent stockouts due to delayed reimbursements from the CBHI to clinics. Women experience longer travel and waiting times, resulting in higher opportunity costs than men. Yet, out-of-pocket expenses remain low—under USD 1 per visit—suggesting minimal financial risk to patients across income brackets. Patients rated the quality and acceptability of services highly, though most facilities lacked NTD treatment protocols. The study underscores how domestic efforts—such as budget allocations and health insurance coverage—have helped improve access. However, it stresses the need to streamline reimbursement processes and strengthen supply chains to avoid disruptions in drug availability. The findings provide valuable insight for policymakers aiming to reduce dependency on external funding while enhancing equitable access to NTD care.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Health systems across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) pose significant barriers to the population’s access to health services. There are infrastructural gaps, particularly in rural areas, which experience geographical barriers to health facilities, poor medical supplies, and weak digital health infrastructure [1]. Human resource shortages, urban-biased distribution, and governance challenges continue to pose essential access barriers [2]. Apart from these, perhaps the most significant challenge remains financing, where many countries on the continent are far from meeting their health financing goals, e.g., less than seven countries met the Abuja target, and many countries’ out-of-pocket payments remain unacceptably high with low domestic spending and continued reliance on external resources [3]. With increasing anxiety over the long-term financing from external sources exemplified by the exit of USAID and sustainability challenges, one program area of concern is the financing of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). NTDs are diverse communicable yet preventable parasitic, viral, and bacterial diseases that affect over 1.0 billion of the world’s poorest and vulnerable populations primarily in tropical and sub‐tropical settings in Africa, Asia, and the Americas [4–6]. Up to 40% of the affected populations live in Africa, with the poorest and most vulnerable residing in hard-to-reach geographical areas [7–9]. Among the most prevalent NTDs, schistosomiasis (SCH) and soil-transmitted helminths (STH), or intestinal worms, remain a global public health concern and are highly prevalent in low and middle-income countries. They primarily affect poor communities with no access to potable water [10]. It is estimated that about 251.4 million people globally required preventive treatment for SCH in 2021, of which 93% of the total burden is found in sub-Saharan Africa [11]. Despite the existence of treatment and preventive measures, NTDs continue to be responsible for many years of life lost due to disability and premature death among the poor [12]. NTDs, therefore, constitute a disproportionate health burden to marginalized populations and exacerbate inequity. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 3) seek to close the health equity gap and have highlighted NTDs as necessary in achieving this objective. Improving access to NTD services is paramount to the SDGs agenda of reducing disease burden and improving health outcomes for all. Among children, NTDs contribute to disabilities and cognitive impairment, limiting their ability to progress with education and improve their living standards in adulthood [13]. Among adults, NTDs limit productivity and directly impact economic development [14]. Factors that exacerbate the NTD burden include poverty and marginalization, underfunding for health systems, and poor surveillance data [15,16]. The endemicity, the burden, and poor financing of NTDs in Africa are well documented [6,13,16–21]. Rwanda is considered one of the best-performing countries in Africa in its efforts to improve access to health services through public health insurance schemes and increased government spending on healthcare. For example, while Rwanda’s current health expenditure as a share of GDP stands at about 7.2%, its neighbours such as Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda and Tanzania average 3% of GDP as of 2020 [22] However, the country remains endemic for two of the five NTDs amenable to preventive chemotherapy (PC) [23]. National prevalence of SCH ranged between 0% and 70% in areas surrounding water bodies in 2008, and the prevalence has declined significantly over the years, according to recent assessment reports [23,24]. In 2020, data yet to be published by the Rwanda Biomedical Centre (RBC) showed that the threshold for elimination as a public health problem was reached in 97% of high-risk villages selected to assess the impact. In contrast, the national prevalence of STH infections stood at 41% as of 2020 [7,23,25]. However, the 2020 impact assessment found that adults remain the most infected compared to school-aged children, i.e., 48% versus 41%. In light of diminishing international support for NTD programs [26], and to maintain the gains in the fight against NTDs and increase service coverage for all, there is greater emphasis on domestic financing for sustainability. Currently, financing STH, SCH, and other related NTDs in Rwanda heavily depends on external sources. From the approved budgets, the funding for STH and SCH was RWF 6,250.59 million (USD 6.16 million) in the financial year 2021/22 and RWF 9048.54 million (USD 8.46 million) in 2022/23. External sources accounted for almost 92% of overall STH and SCH spending RWF 14,032.71 (USD 13.47 million) in the FYs 2021/22 and 2022/23. However, the government contribution significantly increased from RWF 126.33 (USD 0.12) million in 2021/22 to RWF 1100.388 (USD 1.07) million in 2022/23. Despite the increase in government budget, external funding remains significant and could grossly affect NTD service delivery if abruptly cut. To reduce dependency on external funding for NTDs, the government aims to increase budget allocation to account for at least 40% of the NTD budget to ensure sustainability [27]. Alongside budget increases, the Rwandan Government has improved access to NTD services by rolling out bi-annual mass drug administration (MDA), ensuring that over 65 million treatments against intestinal worms and schistosomiasis were delivered to children aged 1–15 years since 2008 [28]. The government has taken further steps to improve access to NTD treatment and preventive services by progressively integrating NTDs into the national health insurance benefit package- the Community-Based Health Insurance (CBHI) scheme. Rwanda’s CBHI scheme was initiated by the Rwandan Government in 2005 to spread the financial burden of medical costs and ensure that the poor and vulnerable households have access to essential health services without incurring a financial burden [29]. The government subsidizes the CBHI scheme at almost 50% of the total funding [29–31]. The benefits package includes comprehensive preventive and curative services and essential drugs at health centers and referral hospitals. Integrating NTDs into the routine health services delivery system is a crucial indicator for domestic financing and is considered a key step toward sustainable NTD programming in endemic countries [32]. While the efforts to eliminate NTDs through sustainable financing in Rwanda are commendable, there are empirical gaps on whether the current funding from domestic sources (government and public insurance) has improved NTD service availability, affordability, and optimized utilization by the population to contribute toward sustainable elimination. For instance, STH and SCH services are expected to be available and affordable to all those in need of the services, but the range of services covered, their availability, demand, and utilization, and who bears the cost burden in trying to access SCH and STH services, is not well-understood in Rwanda. The aim of this study is, therefore, to provide evidence on the implications of public financing of NTDs on service access. This will assist the government and the CBHI in improving domestic resource mobilization and allocation for effective and sustainable NTD elimination. A protocol was submitted to the Ethics and Scientific Review Committee of the Rwanda National Research Ethics Committee (RNEC) and the Rwanda Biomedical Centre (RBC). Approval for the study was received from RNEC (RNEC-IRB 0001497 of I0RGOOO1100) on August 11, 2023—collaboration letter from the Rwanda Biomedical Centre (RBC), Ref. No M84/RBC/2023, provided a human subjects exemption for this research on 13 October 2023. The study relied mainly on primary survey data collected through exit interviews. Secondary data were collected to inform the NTD financing situation in Rwanda and to understand the government budget for operational costs related to mass drug administration (MDA). This study was conducted in 24 randomly selected health centers in four Rwanda districts: Gisagara, Rubavu, Burera, and Rutsiro. These are amongst the districts with the co-endemicity for STH and Schistosomiasis as reported in the Rwanda NTDs Strategic Plan 2019–2024 [24]. In addition, these districts had a high number of STH and SCH, all combined from June 2021 to December 2022, which is the window period of the study. All the selected health centers were providing STH and SCH services (deworming medications including albendazole, mebendazole, and praziquantel; diagnostics for Schistosomiasis (SCH) and STH or intestinal worms) covered by the CBHI scheme. The sample size was calculated using the SCH and STH facility visits data for 2022, which was estimated at 207,572 visits. Assuming each of the 24 facilities had an equal number of visits during the year 2022, each facility received about 8649 SCH and STH patients, which translates to about 24 visits per day in each facility. Aiming for a higher sample size, the study chose to interview 50% of the census sample, i.e., every second patient in each facility was interviewed, which gave a total sample size of 288 SCH and STH patients. 235 patients were accepted to participate in the study, with an acceptable response rate of about 82%. In addition, 24 facility in-charges from the 24 health facilities were interviewed to assess stock levels of SCH and STH drugs. A total of four data collectors were assigned responsibility for collecting data at each of the 24 facilities. Each two-person team split responsibility between collecting facility data of individual facilities and interviewing individual study participants to assess the availability, affordability, and utilization of STH and SCH services. Data collection was completed between August and September 2023. Exit interview participants were recruited from the 24 facilities among the target populations in need of STH and SCH services who came to a study site seeking these services. Individual participants were selected after they had received STH and SCH services at the respective facility. The research assistants explained the study to each potential participant, using an approved recruitment script, and all respondents were asked if they were willing to voluntarily participate in the study. All willing participants signed a consent form after acknowledging their understanding of the purpose of the study. Exit interviews were conducted with each eligible participant based on their willingness to participate. The information collected included demographic characteristics of the respondents (age, religion, membership in a health insurance scheme, marital status, individual income, household income, level of education, employment status), transport costs, amount paid for drugs, travel time to and from the facility, and waiting time. English and Kinyarwanda translations of the participant and facility questionnaires were loaded onto a mobile data collection application, KoBoCollect, which was used to record responses. In this study, we considered three key dimensions of access [33] which include: (i) availability of services (drugs and non-drug pharmaceuticals, physical accessibility including distance to facility and travel time, and availability of qualified staff (ii) affordability of services including cost of medicine, travel costs, cost of consultation incurred concerning tests/investigations, other indirect costs); (iii) acceptability of services such as social and cultural context (gender) affecting accessibility, and individual patient perceptions of quality of services. Accessibility was assessed using the WHO availability target of greater than or equal to 80%. Affordability was estimated based on the average monthly wage for the lowest-paid government worker (LPGW). From an economic costing perspective, affordability was also estimated using direct financial expenses and opportunity costs. Costs to STH and SCH patients are largely restricted to the charges for the transport costs incurred from home to the treatment site and opportunity costs. The out-of-pocket costs included round-trip transportation costs, which were assessed through the exit interviews, and the time required for obtaining treatment, which included the round-trip travel time to the facility, waiting time, and time for consultation until exit from the facility. The patient’s daily earnings give an estimate of the value of time spent at the health facility. Data were analyzed using STATA version 17. Simple descriptive statistics assessed the availability, affordability, and utilization/demand of the selected STH and SCH drugs and related services. An availability of 80% or higher was used as the benchmark for accessibility as per WHO guidelines [34]. The combined availability of commodities that were surveyed was calculated to provide the overall availability of that specific commodity at the facility. Stockout information was sought from all the selected STH and SCH commodities covered by the CBHI scheme, which were supposed to be available at that level of care, regardless of whether they were in or out of stock at the time of the survey. Stockout was calculated as the percentage of facilities that reported at least one stockout of the selected STH and SCH commodity over the measured period, with stockout days calculated as the average number of days stockouts of a commodity lasted per facility. To calculate affordability, the median price of the entire treatment course of a commodity was compared to the official salary of the lowest-paid government worker (LPGW), per day in 2023. If a commodity price exceeded one day’s wages, it would be considered unaffordable based on the World Bank’s international poverty line (IPL) of USD 2.15 per person per day. Accessibility was calculated using the availability and LPGW affordability measures. This resulted in a composite measure in which accessibility is achieved with an 80% or higher availability and a price of less than a day’s wage for an LPGW. The results were then compared with information on income and expenditure obtained from patients participating in the survey. The results, presented in Table 1, revealed that the respondents tended to be young, with 39.2% under 30 years old. About the same number of respondents were single and never married (28%) or were living together (28.1%). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t001 As depicted in Fig 1, almost all the patients (99%) received consultation services, 29.8% received SCH diagnostic services, and 85% received STH diagnostics. A third of the respondents (33%) received the prescribed albendazole medicine, and 66.8% and 12.8% received the prescribed mebendazole and praziquantel medicines. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.g001 Regarding stockouts of STH and SCH drugs on the day of the survey (Fig 2), 22 (92%) out of the 24 facilities did not have praziquantel drugs, and 11 (46%) had no diagnostics for STH or intestinal worms. In comparison, diagnostics for schistosomiasis were unavailable in 14 (58%) of the facilities. However, mebendazole drugs were available in all 24 health facilities. Note that, as the primary strategy for the NTD elimination programs, preventive chemotherapy (PC) employs anthelmintics, such as albendazole (ADZ) or mebendazole (MBDZ) for STHs, ADZ and diethylcarbamazine (DEC) and/or ivermectin (IVM) for LF and onchocerciasis, and praziquantel (PZQT) for SCH [35]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.g002 The stockout of STH/SCH drugs forced patients to either use an alternative drug, e.g., mebendazole in place of albendazole, or to visit the facility another day when supplies were available. Alternatively, those who could afford it were advised by health workers to purchase at private facilities. As noted by the study, one of the major contributors to drug stockouts is a delay in receiving reimbursements for services provided. At the time of the survey, 23 out of the 24 facilities in the sample indicated that they experienced delays in receiving reimbursements from the CBHI through the Rwanda Social Security Board (RSSB) for services provided during FY 2021/22 and FY 2022/23. Table 2 presents the estimated number of months of delays in receiving the funds. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t002 About 75% of the facilities experienced 2–4 months of delays. The respondents cited several causes for the delays, including errors in preparing the invoice (37.5%), delays in submitting the invoice by the facilities (45.8%), delayed reimbursement from the CBHI scheme (79.2%), and delays in verifying the invoices (20.8%). The delayed reimbursement does not affect SCH and STH services alone, but the availability of all services is affected since health facilities cannot replenish their entire stocks before funds are made available. The study also considered the time taken to receive services (travel and waiting time) as a measure of availability in the timely use of NTD services. On average, women spent more time than men receiving NTD services (307.4 minutes or 5.0 hours for women compared to 238.5 minutes or 4.0 hours for men). In travel time, women spent about 95.93 minutes (approximately 2 hours) traveling to health facilities versus 78.94 minutes (approximately 1.3 hours) spent by men. Similarly, average time spent with the clinician, average waiting time, and average time after consultation to exit the facility were approximately 159.6 minutes (approximately 2.6 hours) for male patients and 211.5 minutes (3.5 hours) for female patients (Table 3). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t003 There was no immediate explanation for the differences between men and women in the time taken to receive services. However, less travel time and higher transport costs for men compared to women indicate that more men than women used motorbikes or other faster and more expensive means of transportation to the health facility. This suggests an economic advantage for men in accessing health facilities. A summary of patients’ indirect costs (cost of travel and waiting time), direct costs, and total costs for accessing STH and SCH treatment is presented in Table 4. The average total cost (including both direct and opportunity costs) to access and utilize STH and SCH services was US$0.72 (RWF 834.08) and US$0.96 (RWF 1,112.11) for male and female respondents, respectively. The average total cost for the opportunity costs accounted for 1.5% (US$0.45 or RWF 521.30) of the total average cost per day for male respondents. In comparison, the opportunity cost for female respondents accounted for 2.4% (US$0.68 or RWF 787.75) of the total cost per day. The out-of-pocket costs for transportation fares amounted to $0.09 (RWF 104.26) and $0.06 (RWF 69.51) for male and female respondents, respectively. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t004 The findings indicate that the average daily income was highest among male respondents at RWF1,784.01 (US$1.54) against RWF 1,702.92 (US$1.47) for females. The results show disparity in the costs for male and female respondents, which is largely driven by the amount of travel time and, hence, the cost per round trip. Table 5 presents the total average cost of time for the daily visits. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t005 The total cost to patients accessing STH and SCH services for a month was compared with the average monthly household income (Table 5). The results show that male patients paid direct costs of nearly US$0.28 (about 0.95% of average household income per month) for a month (assuming one visit to the health facility per month) to access treatment services at the facilities. The share of direct costs paid by female patients was US$0.28, which is about 0.99% of the average household income per month of US$28.30. The direct costs combined with indirect costs produced a total mean cost burden of US$0.72 or 3.4% of household income per month for male patients and a mean total cost per month of US$0.96 or 2.5% of average monthly household income for female patients (Fig 3). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.g003 The total direct and indirect costs as a share of household income are presented in Table 6. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t006 The results show that the poorest households spent about 3.3% of their income on STH and SCH care. On the other hand, those in the middle—and upper-income brackets spent between 1.7% and 2.5% of their income on STH and SCH care and treatment. The wealthiest households with an income of RWF 250,000 spent 4.7% on STH and SCH treatment and care. These findings, including on the expenditures of LPGW, show no real financial risk involving catastrophic payments for STH and SCH services. These findings show that the cost burden of SCH and STH services is progressive because of government subsidies that target low-income earners. Higher income brackets are also likely to spend more on faster means of transportation and also pay out of pocket during stockouts. Costs by district show Rubavu District is the most expensive for those seeking SCH and STH services. Women incur the highest cost averaging about USD 1.37 against men who incur USD 0.83 per trip (Table 7). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t007 In addition to cost, the quality of services is an important determinant of using STH and SCH services. In this study, respondents were asked to record their level of satisfaction concerning: (i) quality of treatment received, ii) privacy and confidentiality, iii) timeliness in the provision of services, (iv) facility cleanliness and hygiene, (v) attitude towards patients, (vi) overall rating. A rating scale (excellent, good, fair, and poor) was used. Most respondents (78.3%) rated the services provided as good, while 17.5% rated them as fair and 1.7% rated the services as poor. Other aspects of acceptability (e.g., cleanliness and hygiene, privacy of treatment and waiting time, and staff attitude) were similar, indicating that an overwhelming majority of the respondents viewed the services as acceptable (Table 8). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t008 In addition, the study assessed the availability of treatment protocols as a measure of improved patient-centered outcomes. The survey results revealed that 21 (88%) of the facilities did not have NTD treatment protocols for various NTDs, and only three facilities reported availability of treatment protocols for NTDs. The utilization of STH and SCH services decreased slightly from 215,267 OPD visits in 2021–207,572 OPD visits in 2022 (Table 9). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t009 The data show that most STH and SCH patients were treated asymptomatically. Patients receiving intestinal worm medications (mebendazole or albendazole) accounted for 82.3% of the total outpatient (OPD) visits over the two years. In contrast, diagnostics accounted for 17.3% of the visits for STH and 4% for SCH. In terms of utilization by district, the health facilities in Burera district accounted for 29.1% and 29.7%, respectively, of the total utilization of STH and SCH services, followed by Rubavu, which accounted for 26.7% and 26.2% in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Facilities in the Gisagara district reported the lowest utilization, at 17.7% in 2021 and 18.8% in 2022 (Table 10). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t010 The number of OPD visits for all STH and SCH services during the two years declined slightly, except for intestinal worm medication. The largest drop in outpatient utilization (OPD) was observed in the diagnostics for Schistosomiasis (from 1732 OPD visits in 2021–136 OPD visits in 2022), followed by patients for deworming medications (mebendazole), whose utilization declined from 79,233 in 2021–70,826. There are concerns about access and sustainability of health services in general and NTD programs in particular due to overreliance on external funding and low domestic investments. Sustainability means the capacity of a health system to maintain the gains toward NTD prevention and control on the path to elimination. Poor access to NTD services has broader policy implications beyond the health system. It imposes an economic burden by reducing productivity and contributes to a cycle of poverty and social exclusion [36]. Late-stage presentations of most NTDs are not just fatal but are a significant burden to health facilities and jeopardize progress toward Universal Health Coverage. The United Nations SDGs recognize universal access to NTD services as integral to achieving UHC [37]. On the other hand, children afflicted with NTDs have lower educational achievement as NTDs increase absenteeism and cognitive impairment, therefore potentially contributing to lower social status [13,38]. As a largely neglected program in many low- and middle-income countries, countries are encouraged to invest domestic resources to control and eliminate NTDs. In Rwanda, the bulk (90%) of funding for STH and SCH prevention and elimination is external. However, the Rwanda Government has progressively relied less on external support to control and eliminate NTDs. The steps include (i) the introduction of a budget line for procurement of NTD drugs, (ii) the design and delivery of a package of NTD care under the CBHI scheme, (iii) the adoption of one health policy that commits to enhance collaboration of different actors of NTD stakeholders, (iv) budget allocation for MDA operational costs, and (v) decentralization of NTD interventions and integration of NTD prevention efforts to the village level under district coordination. The study focused on understanding how public domestic financing through the Rwandan government’s introduction of a budget line for NTD drugs and financing under the CBHI scheme has influenced access to and utilization of SCH and STH services in Rwanda. The introduction of a budget vote influences access to healthcare by guaranteeing a resource basket, affecting the funding available for health services [39]. In so doing, it contributes to financial risk protection by lowering the cost of care for individuals. There is a growing body of literature on NTD service access (availability, affordability, and utilization) with mixed results [16,40–42]; e.g., in Ethiopia, Kassahun et al. [40] showed that service availability is relatively good with up to 64% of all health facilities offering STH services, but only 40% had SCH services. Our findings show a similar trajectory of inconsistency in the availability of SCH and STH drugs; e.g., praziquantel is the least available medicine with a stockout rate of 92% because of delays in receiving supplies from MDA implementing health facilities. This is followed by albendazole, received by just 33% of patients seeking care. On the other hand, mebendazole was the most available drug with 100% facilities stocked. In other NTDs, Ooms et al. [41] report low availability of snakebite commodities (43%) in public health facilities. Similarly, the Ethiopian Public Health Institute [43] found that the availability of drugs for NTD treatment varied by facility type, with hospitals more likely than lower-level facilities to be stocked. One of the most cited causes of stockouts of essential drugs is delayed reimbursements to health facilities to allow for timely re-stocking of commodities [44,45]. The consequences of a lack of availability of essential NTD services are not only costly to those seeking care but also discourage repeat visits, which constitutes a barrier to NTD control and elimination. The reimbursements to facilities need to be predictable and the supply chain strengthened, to ensure consistency in the availability of critical NTD services, particularly those prepaid through publicly financed institutions. The availability of SCH and STH services is hampered by distance to health facilities, with women disproportionately affected. Of the 85% of the respondents who walked to a health facility, women spent on average 96 minutes compared to 79 minutes spent by men. The extra time spent by women traveling to health facilities not only has cost implications but also constitutes a physical barrier to accessing NTD services. Although the government took steps to reduce walking time to facilities by 50% (from 95 minutes to 47 minutes) in 2020 [46], the evidence suggests that there are still significant challenges in accessing health facilities in some districts. The steps taken by the government include the construction of health posts and the deployment of community health workers to bring services closer to communities [46]. The use of CHWs to bring NTD services closer to the communities has been proven effective in malaria control and improving maternal and child health services [47,48]. It is highly recommended for effective and sustainable control and elimination of NTDs. What remains encouraging in Rwanda is that SCH and STH services remain essentially affordable with no evidence of catastrophic expenses. Usually, out-of-pocket health expenditure is considered catastrophic and impoverishing when a household is forced to cut down on subsistence needs, sell productive assets, incur debts, or utilize savings to meet health needs [34,41,49,50]. Similar to this study, Dong et. al. [51] reported better affordability overall but also noted a large gap between the affordability levels of originator brands (OBs) and lowest-priced generics (LPGs) of essential drugs in Ethiopia. The affordability of SCH and STH services in Rwanda was primarily influenced by travel and waiting time, whose costs were higher than the expenses for the actual NTD services at health facilities. Noting that the indirect medical expenses disproportionately affected women calls for considering the driving factors in the analysis of access to NTD services in a low-resource setting, such as Rwanda. Women spent about a dollar more than men to access health facilities- a cost mainly attributed to more extended travel and waiting time, which are likely to be an important determinant of STH and SCH services utilization. Saxena et al. [52] have reported cost-related disparities between men and women in access to healthcare. Affordability is a critical determinant of access to health services in most settings, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Generally, essential health services are found to be relatively unaffordable to many people [16,42,49,53–55]. However, treatment costs for STH and SCH services are affordable in a low-income setting, requiring only 13% of a day’s wages from the LPGW. This suggests that NTD control and prevention is one of the best buys in public health available to those affected community members. Studies such as Ooms et. al. [40] have also demonstrated the affordability of NTD services, excluding snake anti-venoms, which are found to be unaffordable to most households in Kenya. Governments should, therefore, be encouraged to invest more in NTD control and elimination as a less costly alternative to the continued neglect of NTDs. Rwanda currently funds operational costs of MDAs, which indicates that significant costs can be domestically resourced when appropriately prioritized through political commitment, effective advocacy, governance, multisectoral coordination structures, and integration within the broader health system budgeting and planning processes. Evidence of steady demand and utilization of STH and SCH services in Rwanda indicates efficiency in the use of investments in NTDs, wherein the target population utilizes the services purchased; i.e., the population’s NTD needs are well aligned with the services purchased. There is also a clear linkage between service use and the reported high patient satisfaction with the services offered. However, the demand and utilization can still be improved with timely reimbursements to health facilities and a strengthened procurement and supply chain for NTD commodities. Satisfaction with health services is a contentious issue, especially in LMIC, with many reporting poor services associated mainly with poor staff attitude, ineffective physician consultations, and inefficient admission process [52,53]. However, in Ghana, there was an overwhelming majority (>95%) of patients who had a positive perception of the quality of services [19]. Our study reported 95.3% satisfaction with SCH and STH services, which means that, although the quality of services is generally low in low-resource settings, there is evidence from both the Ghanaian and Rwandan experiences that this can change for the better. The WHO emphasizes that the goals of UHC cannot be effectively achieved if the quality of services is not satisfactory. The surest way to sustain and eliminate neglected diseases is to combine adequate domestic financing with improved access to and utilization of quality NTD services. This combination needs to be approached from an equity lens, considering the identified gender gaps in access to SCH and STH services. The study is aware of biases related to self-reported data and ensured that the data collected from individual participants were triangulated with discussions with health workers. Micro-level gaps, such as socioeconomic indicators and behavioral determinants of health, were either not relevant to the objective of the study or addressed by having well-trained interviewers to ensure data consistency. The generalizability concerns have been addressed through triangulated data sources and a non-biased sampling process of 24 primary health facilities in different districts representing urban, peri-urban, and rural areas. However, the study acknowledges that the small sample size focusing on primary health facilities may limit generalization in hospital settings. We sincerely appreciate all the respondents who took the time to participate in the survey. We are also grateful to the senior staff at the Rwanda Biomedical Center (RBC) and the Ministry of Health for their kind support during the entire data collection period. We also thank the facility in-charges for their cooperation during this study.

Title: What’s Driving Amazon Stock To New Highs?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/08/29/whats-driving-amazon-stock-to-new-highs/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. In early 2023, Amazon's stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) was trading at a modest $84. Today, it has soared to $232, a stunning 176% jump that significantly outpaces the broader NASDAQ index's 2x rise. So, what's fueling this incredible surge? The answer lies in three critical factors: But the question remains: Can this powerhouse performance continue? We’ll dive into what’s driving this momentum and what the future holds for Amazon. But if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – CoreWeave Stock To $200? Beyond its sheer size, Amazon's revenue growth is driven by a hidden engine: a powerful shift in its business model. While its e-commerce sales are impressive, they are no longer the primary force. The real story lies in the company's strategic diversification, with three key areas serving as the main catalysts for its recent surge. The undisputed heavyweight champion of Amazon's growth is Amazon Web Services (AWS). This cloud computing arm has proven to be an exceptionally valuable asset, far outpacing the growth of Amazon's traditional retail operations. While North American and international sales grew by 23% and 21% respectively between 2022 and 2024, AWS revenue surged by a solid 34% over the same period. Its high-margin, scalable services for businesses, governments, and individuals make it the company's most important growth engine. Another crucial, and often overlooked, driver of Amazon's financial success is its rapidly expanding digital advertising business. Much like Google and Meta, Amazon has leveraged its vast customer data and massive platform to become a dominant player in the ad world. This segment, which includes sponsored product listings and display ads, has been growing at a remarkable pace, providing a high-profit-margin revenue stream that diversifies the company's earnings beyond e-commerce and cloud services. Amazon's third major growth driver is its subscription services, most notably its Prime membership, which has evolved into a comprehensive ecosystem of benefits beyond free shipping to include streaming video and music, exclusive deals, and more. This has created a loyal and engaged customer base that not only pays a recurring fee but also spends more on Amazon's platform than non-Prime members. This steady, predictable revenue stream provides a solid financial foundation and strengthens the company's competitive moat. Looking ahead, these drivers face a new challenge: the intense competition in the AI arms race. AWS's leadership in cloud computing is being challenged by rivals like Microsoft (Azure) and Google (Cloud), who are making massive investments in generative AI. Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI and Google's rapid expansion of AI services pose a significant threat. To maintain its market leadership, Amazon is also pouring tens of billions into AI-related capital expenditures, a strategic move that will shape its future and determine if its extraordinary growth can continue. Amazon's stunning rise in valuation can be attributed to its dramatic financial transformation, where a once-unprofitable e-commerce giant has become a profit-making powerhouse. This shift has reshaped investor sentiment and sent its valuation soaring. The most significant catalyst behind this change is AWS. This high-margin cloud business has single-handedly revolutionized Amazon's profitability. Since 2022, Amazon's operating margin has skyrocketed by an astounding 377%, climbing from a meager 2.4% to a robust 11.4%. This incredible expansion in profitability, fueled by AWS, is the key reason investors are now willing to pay a premium for Amazon's stock. It signals a new era of sustainable, high-quality earnings. This surge in profitability, combined with strong revenue growth and the strategic expansion of AWS, has directly impacted Amazon’s valuation. Investors now value the company as a technology and cloud leader. As a result, the company's price-to-sales valuation multiple has ballooned by 124%, jumping from 1.7x trailing revenues in 2022 to an impressive 3.7x today. This multiple expansion is a direct reflection of the market's newfound confidence in Amazon's long-term profit potential. At its current price of around $230, Amazon's stock is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.7x, which aligns closely with its five-year average of 3.2x. However, there are compelling reasons to believe the valuation multiple could expand further. See, AI is not just a buzzword for Amazon; it's a strategic weapon poised to supercharge its growth and reshape its financial future. The company's massive investments in artificial intelligence are set to ignite a new wave of expansion across its entire business empire. Within AWS, AI is the new frontier. As businesses race to develop and deploy their own AI applications, they are driving unprecedented demand for AWS's cloud infrastructure. This isn't just about incremental growth; it's a direct catalyst for skyrocketing cloud sales, solidifying AWS's position as a profit powerhouse. In fact, if you want a detailed breakdown of how this growth can help Amazon's stock, take a look at our analysis – Amazon Stock: Path to 2x Growth – which highlights the key factors. But the AI revolution isn't limited to the cloud. On the retail side, AI is being woven into the very fabric of the shopping experience. Think smarter product recommendations, lightning-fast search, and deeply personalized storefronts. These aren't just minor upgrades—they're powerful tools designed to boost sales, increase the value of every order, and make advertising on the platform more effective than ever. This enhanced ad targeting will also extend its influence across the wider digital advertising landscape, creating a lucrative new revenue stream. All of this adds up to a compelling financial outlook. Amazon projects low double-digit sales growth over the next three years, with its bottom-line profits expected to grow even faster. This blend of accelerating profitability, continued AWS dominance, and an ironclad grip on the e-commerce market, presents a powerful case for a higher valuation. Investors are already taking notice, recognizing that Amazon's strategic AI initiatives are not just a plan—they're the blueprint for a new era of growth and value creation. Despite its powerful rise, Amazon’s stock is not without its vulnerabilities. Its history is marked by sharp drops that have far outpaced the broader market, highlighting both its inherent volatility and remarkable resilience. During the 2022 inflation-driven market sell-off, Amazon stock plunged a staggering 52%, a far steeper decline than the S&P 500's 25% drop. The stock's recovery took over a year, not regaining its previous high until February 2024. More recently, during periods of heightened trade war concerns, the pattern repeated—Amazon plummeted 30% while the S&P 500's peak-to-trough decline was a more modest 19%. This history shows that when markets turn, Amazon can fall harder and faster than its peers. Beyond market-wide shocks, the company faces significant company-specific risks. A primary concern is its massive capital expenditure. Since 2022, Amazon has invested a colossal $257 billion in CapEx. This is a high-stakes gamble, and a critical question looms: What if these massive investments don't yield the returns investors expect? Simultaneously, the explosive growth of its core profit driver, AWS, could be threatened by intense competition from rivals like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. A slowdown in AWS growth, combined with concerns over the payback on its huge investments, could create a challenging scenario. For a deeper dive into these risks, including the factors that could cause a severe downturn, we've captured a full downside scenario in our separate analysis: How Amazon Stock Falls By 50%? See, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single, or just a handful, of stocks. Consider the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: A New Vision For Money: Hoskinson Predicts Bitcoin Will Hit $10 Trillion

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Charles Hoskinson, a founder of Ethereum and the driving force behind Cardano, laid out a sweeping forecast for crypto markets and payments this week. He predicted Bitcoin could reach $250,000 in the current market cycle and said the token’s total market value might hit $10 trillion in the next five years. Reports have disclosed that he links that outlook to new US stablecoin rules and what he calls clearer market structure. In an interview on the David Lin Report, Hoskinson argued that Bitcoin’s design made it strong as a store of value but limited as a global payments rail. He pointed to the old “big block” debates that pushed the network toward saving rather than everyday payments. Layer Two solutions, he said, are where Bitcoin gains the speed and lower cost needed for daily use. This framing leaves room for other blockchains to offer broader financial services. Hoskinson framed Cardano as an alternative path — one built on research and formal methods rather than rapid experimentation. Based on reports, the network has operated continuously for about eight years and uses a proof-of-stake model that many users back. Reports also state that over 70% of ADA in circulation has been staked by holders who support the network. That figure is commonly cited when comparing Cardano’s staking take-up to other blockchains. Stablecoins are central to Hoskinson’s case. He told lawmakers and audiences that tokens tied to fiat could give people in countries with weak local currencies access to dollar-like stability. According to White House materials, the GENIUS Act has moved through the political process and was signed into law by US President Donald Trump, creating a new US framework for stablecoins. Based on data, the stablecoin market has topped $250 billion in supply, a milestone that regulators and banks are watching closely. Hoskinson was blunt about exchanges and the stock market. He called current exchange practices “preposterous” and criticized systems that rely on centralized trust, including large listing fees and gatekeeping by a few firms. He said decentralized exchanges — where the protocol enforces rules — could cut out those middlemen and give people more control over their assets. That pitch fits a wider industry argument for moving custody and trade settlement onto public blockchains. For Hoskinson, Bitcoin will stay digital gold, while stablecoins, tokenized assets, and decentralized systems grow around it. The real question, he suggests, is not only how high Bitcoin’s price can go, but how the movement of money will be reshaped.

By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Full Content:
UPDATED 06:33 EDT / AUGUST 29 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis.

What am I humming? Bubble Pop by HyunA, for no particular reason. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Nvidia has been on a tear. Just in case you've been living under a nice mossy rock the past few years, the advent of generative AI has ushered in a golden era for the company. Let's talk some truly eye-watering facts and figures: during Nvidia's Q2 2025 earnings call, the company reported a total revenue of $46.7 billion. Okay, so it's more like a diamond-encrusted-with-foie-gras-on-the-side era, but it's been far from smooth sailing. As such, with the next-gen Rubin architecture just off the horizon and data centre demand continuing to grow, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said during the aforementioned earnings call, "We advise our partners, our customers to pace themselves." It's bizarre to hear the head of a company making bank say anything to the effect of 'actually, hold your horses,' but Huang advises that Nvidia's AI customers build "data centers on an annual rhythm." Why? There are more than a few potential reasons, ranging from the ever-changing tariff situation in the US, to potential strain on what may well be an AI bubble. But, specifically referring to Nvidia's H100 and H200 GPU clusters often used in AI data centres, Huang had this to say: "Right now, the buzz is — I'm sure all of you know about the buzz out there. The buzz is everything sold out." We've also seen stock supply issues on the gaming side. Early supplies of RTX 50-series GPU stock left much to be desired, making it an absolute mission to find a card at MSRP only a few months ago. Still, gaming alone raked in $4.3 billion for Nvidia, according to the Q2 2025 earnings call. Thankfully, it's a little easier to find a 50-series card at a reasonable price now, as our best graphics cards deals guide can attest. However, it's worth noting that Nvidia's AI revenue vastly overshadows even the billions made by its gaming division. As such, Huang kept these priorities in sight as he reassured investors that Nvidia was taking steps to avoid similar scarcity with Rubin later this year. In his closing remarks, Huang said, "Our next platform, Rubin, is already in fab. We have six new chips that represent the Rubin platform. They have all ticked up at TSMC. Rubin will be our third-generation NVLink rack scale AI supercomputer, and so we expect to have a much more mature and fully scaled up supply chain." Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Given the constantly shifting US tariff situation and its far-reaching effects on the wider geopolitical stage, it's hard to comment on the projected success of even the best laid plans. And then there's the fact that major player Meta is actually looking to downsize its own AI division—could this herald the shape of things to come for AI's place within big tech? If Huang suspects as much, he didn't let on, instead saying, "Blackwell and Rubin AI factory platforms will be scaling into the $3 trillion to $4 trillion global AI factory build out through the end of the decade." 👉Check out our full guide👈 1.

Title: Concerns Grow As Strategy Issues More Stocks To Buy Bitcoin

Strategy’s latest stock sale to buy more Bitcoin has put investor nerves on edge, as numbers and timing raise fresh doubts about shareholder dilution and the company’s funding choices. Based on reports, Strategy changed its public guidance on August 18 and then, within days, moved to issue a large amount of new stock. CryptoQuant analyst JA Maartunn traced the pattern: no fresh issuance on Aug. 3, roughly $18 million on Aug. 10, about $51 million on Aug. 17 — then close to $360 million raised in a single week after the guidance change. That sharp jump in new capital has drawn scrutiny from market watchers who worry the company is leaning on share issuance to keep buying Bitcoin. The new rules link stock sales to something called market net asset value, or mNAV, which compares the company’s share price to the value of its Bitcoin. Strategy running out of steam? 🚂💨 Before Aug 18, almost no new money came into $MSTR: 🔹 Aug 3: $0 🔹 Aug 10: ~$18M 🔹 Aug 17: ~$51M But after they dropped the “no dilution below 2.5x mNAV” promise, $359M was raised by issuing new shares (see tweet below). Policy changed.… https://t.co/nenuT1soI3 pic.twitter.com/pORoidxPhf — Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) August 26, 2025 If the stock trades at more than four times its mNAV, the company will sell lots of shares to buy more Bitcoin. If it trades between 2.5 and four times, it will sell some shares, but more carefully. And if the stock drops below 2.5 times, share sales would mostly go toward paying debt or covering dividends instead of buying Bitcoin. Reports add that if Strategy shares trade under 1x mNAV, the company could borrow to repurchase stock. That framework reversed an earlier pledge not to sell shares for Bitcoin purchases when mNAV was below 2.5x — a reversal that critics point to as the key change. According to the company’s SEC filing, nearly $310 million came from at-the-market common stock sales at an average share price of $354, plus roughly $47 million from preferred share classes. In total, the firm raised a little more than $357 million and used the proceeds to buy 3,081 Bitcoin. The purchase pushed its holdings to 632,457 BTC. That stack of 632,457 coins equals roughly 3% of circulating supply, based on market counts cited in filings and market reports. The company’s public target remains at 1 million coins — a goal that, by the reported figures, is now about 60% complete. Investors focused on dilution have reason to be worried. Each new share increases the number of claims on the same Bitcoin pool, and when issuance happens while the stock trades at low multiples to mNAV, existing holders see their per-share Bitcoin backing decline. Reports say Strategy’s debt sits at about 20% of Bitcoin NAV with headroom up to 30%, giving it borrowing room — but choosing to issue equity at low mNAVs still weakens per-share economics.

Title: Wall Street Largely Cheers Nvidia's Outlook Even as China Remains an Overhang

Nvidia’s (NVDA) results and outlook elicited a mixed response from Wall Street analysts on Thursday, with some cheering the chip giant's revenue forecast and others lamenting uncertainty around sales to China. The poster child for the AI boom on Wednesday projected third-quarter revenue of $54 billion, plus or minus 2%. The forecast exceeded Wall Street's official estimate of $53.8 billion, but by a narrower margin than many investors have come to expect. Nvidia issued its guidance as it posted better-than-estimated second-quarter results, although key data center revenue lagged forecasts. Nvidia shares are down around 2% in early trading on Thursday, but have retraced larger after-hours declines following the results. Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the stock to $210 from $206 and kept its overweight call, saying Nvidia shares are "less expensive than other AI beneficiaries." They said the "bar [set by Nvidia] continues to be high but the growth acceleration is clear." “For the stock to sell off slightly after hours on these types of numbers certainly indicates that sentiment has largely caught up to the growth potential, after fears of digestion just a few weeks ago,” they wrote. “But outside of China geopolitics, this is a very clean beat and raise quarter." Nvidia CFO Collette Kress said during the earnings call Wednesday that the company hasn't restarted sales of its H20 chips in China yet while the company waits for the U.S. government to formalize its revenue-sharing agreement. Earlier this year, the Trump administration blocked Nvidia’s sale of its H20 chips, which the company tailored for the Chinese market, then this month struck a deal where Nvidia would give the government 15% of China chip revenues in exchange for resumed sales. UBS analysts said they were optimistic on the prospects the rally in the AI-driven bull market would continue after Nvidia's results. “The overall strength of the July quarter results may offer some reassurance for investors after signs of stalling momentum for the large-cap tech rally,” UBS analysts wrote, adding that “the outlook for large-cap tech remains compelling.” Several of Nvidia’s major Big Tech clients, including Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), have committed to spending big on their AI capacity, and Nvidia said Wednesday that one customer spent more than $10 billion last quarter. Kress said late Wednesday that the chipmaker anticipates $3 trillion–4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade. HSBC was less upbeat, however, saying Nvidia hasn't delivered a "beat and raise" quarter since its second-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings last year. "We maintain our Hold rating as we expect the near-term supply inconsistency and China uncertainty to remain an overhang," they wrote. Even Morgan Stanley analysts noted that prospects for a resumption of China sales are unclear, and that uncertainties remain around the 15% revenue deal with the government and the need for Beijing to give the green light to resume chip sales. China accounted for 20% of Nvidia’s data center revenue at one point and “while it remains a large market, we simply don’t know how large it will be when it comes back, or if it comes back at all," the analysts wrote.

Title: Media & Marketing Financials – August 2025

by Mathew Broughton on 28th Aug 2025 in News With Autumn and ATS London on the horizon, ExchangeWire research lead Mat Broughton takes stock (if you'll pardon the pun) of company financials across the media and marketing ecosystem. A solid quarter overall for our monitored advertising technology companies, however subsequent volatility suggests headwinds for the remainder of the year. As we track to the start of the calendar month, the chart above does not account for the post-results hit to The Trade Desk, which took a near 40% thumping in terms of its share price off of a deceleration in growth. Despite reaping recent rewards with its continued championing of the open web, investors panicked over competition from the likes of Amazon. As summarised by Madison & Wall, “Long-term optimism around the opportunity from the open web for The Trade Desk continues to seem unfounded to us[...] As well uncertainties abound around the mix of revenue trends for the company from data vs. technology fees.” Ouch. This had a knock-on effect on the rest of the sector, with Zeta, MNTN, Magnite, PubMatic and Viant, all seeing share price dips despite solid earnings. Simultaneously, we saw AppLovin continue its meteoric rise, despite ongoing scrutiny as to its practices. If The Trade Desk gets thumped for calling Amazon a potential partner, why does AppLovin avoid the hammer for wholly partnering with Meta whilst simultaneously acting as a parasite? This is all not to forget the latest flop in the flip-flop-flip-flop saga of Google deprecating third-party cookies across its Chrome browser, now deciding that users will no longer be offered the choice to use, or not use, the cookie. Where one door of uncertainty closes, another opens… The big tech and social platforms recorded astounding revenue growth across the board, particularly considering the age of some of these firms. Notably, Meta, Reddit, and Apple all exceeded earnings expectations despite Trump's tariffs and economic slowdown. Twas much of the same for Google parent Alphabet, as its third-party network business continues to stagnate, whilst YouTube goes gangbusters, achieving double-digit growth to reach USD$9.8bn (£7.2bn). Search revenue also continues to climb, bouldering 12% upwards to over USD$54bn (£39.9bn). Google claims that its AI search results monetise at the same rate as traditional search ads, despite these decimating publisher traffic, indicating these generate far fewer clicks, and comparatively showing far fewer ads within its AI Mode. I asked Google AI Mode to clarify:Righto. A highly tumultuous time across the agency landscape, with the public-listed holding groups exposed to the joint gales of AI and upstart independents. In recent months, we’ve seen a frankly aggressive period of client switching, with massive brand accounts switching hands nigh-on every week. Through this turbulence, Omnicom and IPG had a stable quarter ahead of the closure of their blockbuster merger. Further consolidation was seemingly on the cards, with Sir Martin Sorrell’s S4Capital mulling over a merger approach from private equity-backed MSQ Partners, only for the mooted acquirer to come out and say that they had not made an approach, nor would ever do so ever again. Savagery Publicis continues to fly, nabbing accounts aplenty at the expense of its rivals. I’ve used the phrase “mastering the narrative” a lot in recent months regarding Publicis, and they continue to do so, rightfully highlighting that scrutiny will shift onto Omnicom/IPG following the completion of their merger (much to the delight of beleaguered WPP). As industry expert Barry Dudley observed: "having an enemy, a Goliath to your David, is very commonly what drives people, drives businesses. This has been the environment that Publicis has been playing within." A mixed bag among the publisher set, with digital publishers and streaming providers seeing strong gains, whilst traditional linear TV publishers continue to face headwinds. Despite market challenges, UK publishers showed strong momentum, whilst audience targeting, first-party data strategies, and AI integration, all dominated earnings presentations. Consolidation has cooled in the segment, barring the merger between Nextar and Tegna, which seeks to solidify shaky foundations beneath the house of local TV across the US. Despite rampant speculation earlier in the year, gossip has quietened about a potential divestment of ITV Studios from the parent ITV business, however talks may still be ongoing on that front.

Title: Investors are looking at bargains in China, says HSBC investment boss, pushed by AI discounts and fears over Trump 2.0

Eleanor Pringle is an award-winning reporter at Fortune covering news, the economy, and personal finance. Eleanor previously worked as a business correspondent and news editor in regional news in the U.K. She completed her journalism training with the Press Association after earning a degree from the University of East Anglia. When President Trump returned to the White House his intention was clear: to make America great again. But the United States’ economic partners, and some of its rivals, are also benefiting from having the unorthodox showman back in the Oval Office. Investors are watching the U.S. stock market with both enthusiasm and trepidation: The S&P 500 is up 15% over the past year, Treasuries have remained relatively steady, and the Fed’s monetary policy is expected to begin a downward trajectory. But overlaying the strong fundamentals are questions: Is the soaring growth of Magnificent Seven stocks overvalued on the unfulfilled promises of AI? Will Trump’s unusual foreign policy materially damage the domestic economy? And where might the true winners of the artificial intelligence race emerge from? Increasingly, investors are answering those questions by diversifying into a key region, says Willem Sels, global chief investment officer for HSBC’s global private bank. That region is China. America continues to prove its economic resilience and earnings deliverables, Sels told Fortune in an exclusive interview, but geopolitical uncertainty is pushing investors toward balancing risk with other regions. Traditionally, the question of political influence over portfolios has centered on emerging markets, said Sels, but over the past few years that has moved into developed markets as well. As such, diversification has become more of a focus—particularly for business owners looking to spread risk between the economy they operate in and the assets used to protect their wealth. “When a client comes in the door … the first discussion is, ‘Please build a global portfolio. Maybe try to have as little as possible in your home country if you already have your business here, because that’s diversification,’” Sels said. “Clearly the debate over the last few months was about, Will there be diversification away from the U.S.? And there are a number of elements to that.” Part of the question is how dominant U.S. Big Tech has become in equity markets, with the Magnificent Seven stocks (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla) providing most of the growth. As such, if these stocks hiccup it can have major ramifications for portfolios. “Clearly you potentially need to do something around that … to diversify,” Sels said. “We highlight things like, make sure that you don’t only have the growth stocks but have some value stocks, do some sector diversification, do some geographical diversification, and so on. “The other thing that triggered that diversification discussion obviously was the rapid policy changes in the U.S., and the growth of the debt pile, which led people to ask the question, ‘Is there a de-dollarization story? And what does that mean in terms of my portfolio and other people’s portfolio?’ What we’ve seen in the data is that there have been two months or so where there were some outflows out of bonds and equity markets, but that has not lasted—to a large extent because policy has become a little bit clearer.” “People are adding a little bit to other regions, adding a little bit to other sectors to be less concentrated in the U.S. market, but they are not fleeing away from it,” Sels continued. “There was enthusiasm for European stocks, but it was very short-lived. The Asian investors, over the last 15 [to] 20 years that I’ve been going there, find it very hard to get excited about Europe.” Part of the problem is that these investors don’t see as many new or emerging companies that could materially change the European economy, and there’s also the issue of brand recognition beyond companies like LVMH and BMW, Sels said. “This is the first time that we’re again seeing flows from Europe into China,” Sels added. “That is to a large extent because of the AI trade that people want to play, and then secondly this concept of anti-involution … with the supply-side reforms which would address the issue of overcapacity, therefore the deflation issue and therefore the earnings growth, because what you have in China is a lot of very competitive companies … therefore they have no pressing power, and therefore earnings growth has been reasonably weak.” China has signaled a shift in priorities to address involution, with the country’s Central Finance and Economic Affairs Commission telling President Xi Jinping in a meeting last month that Beijing must “focus on key and difficult issues, regulate enterprises’ disorderly and low-price competition,” and “guide enterprises to improve product quality and promote the orderly exit of outdated production capacity.” Beijing is no stranger to the issue. In 2015 the government launched similar actions to address overcapacity, particularly in key regions like steel and coal, in order to boost corporate profitability. Flash-forward to 2025 and “they’re now addressing that,” Sels said. “Therefore we think that earnings expectations will go up … One of the main obstacles for our clients had been the belief that [Chinese companies are] over-competing, and therefore your earnings are not there, the economic growth is potentially there, but your earnings are not there. “That’s now changing. So we’re seeing flows back and obviously also encouraged by ‘How can I diversify my big U.S. trunk of assets?’” With discussions about diversification out of the U.S. remaining active, China seems to have emerged as the region to balance that risk, Sels said. And Beijing’s typically lower share prices also offer the category of the moment, AI, at a bargain. In a note published last week, HSBC said that within the AI ecosystem, infrastructure stocks are outperforming enablers and adopters—at 22.2% versus 11.3% and 13.5% since July. Indeed, this week Chinese chipmaker Cambricon Technologies briefly became the country’s most expensive stock, surging 10% on Wednesday to 1,465 yuan ($204.62). At the time of writing, the share price has dropped back but is up 112% for the year to date. And while Cambricon exemplifies the more expensive end of the scale, Sels highlights that other equivalents to U.S. stocks can be found at a “30% to 40% discount.” “We’re basically saying, ‘Listen, don’t just look at the chips makers but also look at the guys that build out the infrastructure around it. The guys that build out the energy, the electricity supply around it, the robotics and automation, where it is not just a matter of, we move the data a little bit—this is real, big innovation.’ And so by diversifying throughout the AI ecosystem, I think you address a little bit of the question about valuations.” China’s stock market is soaring: The SSE Composite Index is up 33.4% over the past year, while the S&P 500 is up 14.9%. While the growth in China is marked, HSBC’s research points out U.S. AI-related capital expenditure (driven by the “Big Four” of Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta, along with Stargate and other private companies) is surpassing that of China’s “Big Four” (Alibaba, ByteDance, Tencent, and Baidu, as well as telecom services companies) by eight- to 10-fold. Moreover, HSBC’s research adds: “U.S. firms achieve higher returns on AI capex, with cloud platforms generating significantly more revenue than their Chinese counterparts—close to USD $400 billion in the U.S. vs. USD $60 billion in China in 2024, according to Statista.” So while clients may be balancing against overreliance on American companies, Sels said, the upside fundamentals of the U.S. remain strong—enough to take recession off the table. Indeed, while blips in tech stocks recently led to questions over an AI bubble, the HSBC boss remained bullish: “We certainly think that that AI liftoff is structural in nature.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Chip giant Nvidia’s sales rise 56% in boost for AI boom

US chipmaker reports revenue of $46.74bn for second quarter, defying fears that AI may be overhyped. By John Power Chip giant Nvidia has set a new sales record, a sign that demand for artificial intelligence remains strong despite fearsthe technology may be overhyped. Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company, on Wednesday reported revenue of $46.74bn for the three months that ended in July, a rise of 56 percent year-on-year. Profit for the quarter was $26.42bn, a yearly rise of 59 percent. Nvidia’s latest earnings report had been hotly anticipated as the tech giant is widely seen as a barometer of the AI boom, which has lifted the US stock market from all-time high to all-time high. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that production of Blackwell Ultra, Nvidia’s latest platform using its most advanced chips, was ramping up “at full speed” and demand for the company’s products was “extraordinary”. “The AI race is on, and Blackwell is the platform at its centre,” Jensen said. Looking ahead, the Santa Clara, California-based tech giant predicted revenue of $54bn, plus or minus 2 percent, for the July-September quarter, which would be slightly above market expectations. Despite the robust results, Nvidia’s stock price fell more than 3 percent in after-hours trading, an indication of the sky-high expectations attached to the chipmaker, which is valued at more than $4.4 trillion. Nvidia’s sales notably did not include any shipments to China, whose market is subject to US government export controls intended to blunt Beijing’s ability to develop AI. US President Donald Trump’s administration earlier this month lifted a ban on sales of Nvidia’s H20 chip, which was designed specifically for the Chinese market, following concerted lobbying by Huang. As part of its agreement with the Trump administration, Nvidia agreed to pay the US government 15 percent of revenues from chip sales in China. The lifting of the ban on the H20 raises the possibility that Nvidia could have potentially enormous untapped sales potential in the world’s second-largest economy, though its prospects have been complicated by a recent directive by Beijing urging local firms against doing business with the company. “Just imagine what will happen to this stock if the China business even comes half back to life,” The Kobeissi Letter, a newsletter following capital markets, said. “Jensen Huang will undoubtedly be working overtime on the China situation. The AI Revolution is in full swing.” Fuelled by explosive demand for its AI, Nvidia’s revenue has grown at breakneck speed over the past two years. The company posted triple-digit revenue growth for five straight quarters between mid-2023 and 2024. Since the start of 2023, the price of Nvidia shares has multiplied more than 11 times over, with the stock up more than 30 percent so far this year. The firm’s stellar performance, underpinned by multibillion-dollar AI investments by tech giants including Microsoft, Meta and Amazon, has stoked discussion about whether AI could be in a bubble. In an interview with The Verge earlier this month, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who oversaw the release of the groundbreaking AI model ChatGPT, said he believed that investors were “overexcited” about the technology.
