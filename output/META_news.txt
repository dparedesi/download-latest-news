Title: What "The Best" Looks Like

Talent hits a target no one else can hit. Genius hits a target no one else can see. —Arthur Schopenhauer The second that the next round of funding hits the bank, every new CTO starts obsessing over the same thing: Who the hell do I hire next? The answer is surprisingly non-obvious. You’re told that you always want—scratch that, need—the best of the best, your startup’s future depends on it. You’re told your company is unique, special, and it requires the most hardcore among researchers, designers, engineers, and product managers. You never skimp on who builds the golden goose. You can’t succeed with any less than that. But, is that actually true? Every startup-hustle YouTube video, VC podcast and celeb founder interview regurgitates that the key to success is to hire the very best people, no matter what it takes. And yet you live in the real world, with real-world constraints. You have only so much money in the bank. Only so much time and bandwidth to hire. Only so much attention in a given day. And you’re not alone in your hunt. You’re competing with hundreds of other players in your geography, industry, and problem space looking for “the best.” Many of them have a more famous brand, more cash, more promising equity, more charming founders, and maybe even a high production value promo video showcasing happy employees, rare wood office counters and a shoes-off policy. Will you actually hire the best of the best against those odds? Many years ago I found myself in this pickle and I had to learn all the relevant lessons the hard way. I share these lessons here, so that you don’t have to struggle through that same maze yourself. My pain is your gain. My first time around the startup world in 2012, I hardly knew what I was doing and relied mostly on luck—and unfortunately, firing—to end up with a team I could be proud of. I had no real point of reference for greatness, for what “the best” in our area could look like, and building that model required lots of experimentation, with high highs and many low lows. The story of David, our brilliant infrastructure ops engineer at Freckle, has stayed with me ever since. David applied to the company back when we were only hiring for an ops role. We were growing slowly, so there was zero room for anybody who wasn’t absolutely essential on the team. We had no open-ended extra seat for a smart person who just happened to be on the market, unlike some companies these days. David was 100% what we were not looking for. He had never done any ops. In fact, he had never done anything related to web dev or product engineering. I’m not sure he even knew what AWS was at that point. He was a sharp physics guy working with a professor on simulations in an academic context. He didn’t let that deter him. He wanted to work at Freckle, thanks to our reputation as one of the few software startups in the world using Haskell in production at scale. We were an odd outlier in a sea of buggy and laborious Rails apps, a shelter for people who didn’t want yet another web slop gig. And Haskell was oh-so-hot in the Hacker News programming language theory space at the time, a technology attracting software nerds obsessed with correctness and new, better ways of developing bug-free apps. I immediately told David that he was not a fit; he had none of what we were looking for. And yet he persisted, emailing me that he would do whatever test project we threw at him, and if he bombed it, no problem, he would go away. But if he nailed it, we would have proof that he was qualified, in spite of what his CV indicated. Fine. I sent him a meaty cloud ops take-home project, expecting to never hear from him again. Importantly, this was in the days before you could have Claude Code slap that together for you in two prompts. A day or two later, he returned the project to us, and it was pretty much flawless, doing even more than we had asked for. That was not expected. I got curious about what else he could do. We weren’t drowning in applicants anyway, so I figured I didn’t have much to lose. We took him through the usual interview process. He was humble, optimistic, well-spoken, actively communicating and taking feedback well, eager to get to work. He was pumped about everything he could learn on the job, about the doors that would eventually open if he nailed it. He didn’t have much experience, as someone who had never written commercial software before, but he was really quick to absorb everything we threw at him. We gave him a chance. As predicted, he was stellar, and we had a really good run with him until he moved on to a much more illustrious employer. A few years later he became a senior principal engineer at Stripe, going from a physics lab, then a starry-eyed K-12 software startup, to being a big deal at one of Silicon Valley’s finest firms. An unsurprising path for one of “the best.” While building the different companies I worked at, I’ve run several times into “Davids” who ended up with meteoric career trajectories, sometimes already pedigreed in all the right ways, sometimes completely invisible to everyone but the trained eye of a CTO looking for gold. What is special about someone like that? And how can you, with your humble hiring budget, identify them before their value is obvious to everybody else in the market? With David, it was obvious that I had lucked my way into finding him. He had to badger me into seeing what he was capable of, at a time when I was only looking for obvious signs of success. Later on at my game studio, thanks to a brutally skewed job market, I had the total pick of the litter during Hiring Summer and could select one or two stellar engineers from hundreds of perfectly reasonable applicants. There was hardly any competition, with money drying up all around the industry. Again, I found a diamond in the rough. But this time I had the right knowledge and strategies in place to end up with the kind of team I wanted with far less reliance on luck. Even as I was drowning in hundreds of resumes that all started to look the same, “the best” candidate was still in there, like a needle in a haystack. This time, I felt like I was actually skilled enough to find that hidden gem, not simply crossing my fingers and relying on luck alone. That’s a feeling of empowerment I would like you to experience as well. Of course, when every company says they have the best people, the math doesn’t work out. And of course, if they regularly have to fire staff, something doesn’t add up again. One day you end up landing a job at one of these companies and realize that the braggadocio was hardly reflective of reality, but then again, it’s all part of the startup founder LARP that requires you play the part. “Our team is okay, you will probably like working here, we sometimes know what we’re doing” would be a much more accurate depiction, but you’ll never find that quote on the careers page. Regardless, you want to be a good Boy Scout CTO and live up to the lofty expectations set for you by the Silicon Valley elders, and at least try to hire “the best of the best” as they say in all of the fireside chats. But then, a question naturally emerges: what exactly do we mean by the best? The accolades? Pedigrees? Github stars? Hacker News front pages? Job title? Celebrity employers? Number of former YCombinator companies worked at? Hackathon wins? Typing speed? Clout among other Rust developers wearing fuzzy animal costumes? That all sounds good, I guess, but is that all relevant to your company? It turns out that “the best” is mostly subjective and specific to your situation. The culture, the vibe, the industry, the processes of your company, and the technical choices will all influence who will be a phenomenal addition to your tribe. That person might not be the same individual bringing in a million or two a year at Meta. In fact, that highly pedigreed, highly connected individual might be a net negative for your company, even though they might, at least on paper, seem the most high-end among candidates. They may blow the mind of a recruiter at Netflix, but they may not want to schlep through all of the messiness and chaos of an early stage company still trying to define itself. They’re not the best for you, and they’re likely not the best for startups, but plenty of other people are. Your job is to determine what those traits are and where to find people who have them. Your company, timing, industry, problem space and founding team personalities are unique, which is why a generic blog post or a book could never tell you exactly what hires are optimal for you. However, experience shows that there are many universal winning commonalities between great hires that will be applicable regardless of your early stage company’s unique DNA. I identify 11 of them below. The 11 traits: As a side note, I found Patrick Lencioni’s framework from The Ideal Team Player to survive first contact with both pre-seed and Series A+ realities. It’s one of those dry-as-dust HBR book club management self-help guides that get an eyeroll by your median 20-year-old founder going through YCombinator, but in my experience it confirmed and put a simple model around something I had personally seen emerge again and again in the field. Lencioni identifies three essential traits: hunger, humility and smarts, the latter of which should have been called EQ all along. You’ll see them referenced below. The three criteria may seem obvious at a glance, but having a simple framework to work with as you’re making hundreds of decisions makes a big difference. Simple things done right turn out to be pretty darn powerful. Let’s take a closer look at the 11 commonalities among great startup hires I’ve identified. Some of them are simply statistically likely to occur due to the nature of startup hiring. Others are ones you should straight up filter for when you’re doing your search. The best hires in the early stages are usually non-obviously good to the untrained eye. They don’t look as appealing to employers with infinite resources who otherwise would have already hired them. If they were obviously incredible, it would be unlikely you—at your startup—would ever talk to them. One of the most important skills of a startup CTO trying to hire an amazing team is the ability to uncover awesome talent that others have overlooked. These candidates get skipped often due to being too off-the-beaten-path and under-pedigreed compared to the obvious picks that every other company is making. Often these candidates are bad at marketing themselves, don’t know where to look, and are off-putting in some way to the naive search. You have an opportunity to take advantage of that oversight. Realistically, someone who looks like the perfect FAANG candidate who has won all of the math olympiads, had all of the stellar internships, and went to the top CS schools will either: a. get a big cash dump from YC and start their own thing, or b. go work at one of the career-building brand names in the Valley and make a monstrous amount of money. The karmic wheel is just about cycling between those two until that person either gets into VC or becomes an exec at a prestigious firm years later. If that’s what the universe has in store for a candidate, taking a chance on a no-name team with 12 months in the bank, poor development practices and sloppy management is a tough proposition. That leaves a pretty large pool of “everybody else” who didn’t pattern-match. How you go about sifting through them is a big topic I will leave for another chapter, but the key is to look for signals that are less obvious than a Stanford degree and an OpenAI internship. Often that looks like a large volume of work, expertise in unsexy niche areas of technology, an intense work ethic driven by curiosity, and many others. A Stanford CS degree is no guarantee someone will be a phenomenal contributor at your company, but it’s a reasonable proxy of future potential for large employers with long time horizons that allow them to invest in coaching and nurturing their junior staff. That’s not in the cards for a pre-revenue startup that will run out of money next year. The best people for your startup will most likely be senior, or at least mid-stage contributors with several solid years of experience. Too senior isn’t great either, you don’t need the large scale cross-team mature product jousting chops. There’s likely no staff-level work for them to do, and staff-level engineers aren’t just faster-typing seniors. As an early stage startup, until you have enough lead developers, senior product managers, senior designers etc. to set the standard, hiring fresh-out-of-school contributors is a gamble. Junior staff are still developing their taste, judgment, ability to work in a team, and understanding of how to follow the process and when to deviate from it. Without an adult in the room you’re in cat-herding territory. This isn’t to say that you won’t get work done this way, but you could have had someone else in that seat who required less supervision. And you’re at a stage where every seat is mission-critical and the opportunity cost is significant. While it might not matter too much as you throw prototype spaghetti at the wall in the early days, as soon as you have something worth maintaining and complexity rises, you’re now in a race against time. Someone must actively garden the complexity of the work and be ultimately responsible for it, and that someone will tend to be not fresh-out-of-school. Sure, a green dev can care about complexity. But most haven’t yet lived through a soul-crushing, multi-week refactor fueled by years of tech debt, the kind of preventable trauma that earns you “character-building scars.” If they’re learning those lessons on your watch, they’re doing it at the expense of your delivery timeline and your sanity. I’m fond of mid-stage software developers who demonstrate terrific chops, hunger to learn and prove themselves. Yes, they require more hand-holding, but usually the volume of work they put out, and their openness to re-do it, if needed, is worth betting on. You should be able to manage a couple of them yourself as the CTO in the early days, and soon enough you’ll have other senior people on the team who will pick up the mentorship torch. This also means that the “best people” to hire at this stage will tend to be earlier in their careers. The longer great people are on the market, the more likely they are to be identified by the market as being great. Your job as a startup CTO is to find them before others do. Once the market has found them and has actively started rewarding them, they will be out of your price range. Now, it’s worth mentioning that in specific well-capitalized niches of the startup market, companies are now able to pay a decent chunk of change thanks to larger VC rounds and quicker time-to-revenue. Thus, the old school notion that BigCo always pays best may not hold true as often. Here’s a quick sample of many Work at a Startup roles in December 2025. Not quite at FAANG-level, but far from starvation. That also means that, unless your company grows fast or shows tremendous potential for the yet-unvested equity, you won’t get a ton of time with your great early career hires. They will quickly accumulate valuable experience and prove themselves to be stellar, and move on to a prestigious employer with longer time horizons, a great brand name, and a stupendous paycheck that you will not be able to match. Being an L5-7 at BigCo pays a pretty penny, with none of the unpredictability of startup equity and saner hours, but none of the adventure and camaraderie of a pirate ship. For employees later in their careers, that’s not a bad tradeoff. Once they have vested with your company, it makes sense for them to diversify their equities, as they already own one lottery ticket. Being on the receiving end of a reference call for one of your star employees, while they’re still working at your company, is always bittersweet: on one hand you want what’s best for them, to level up and grow in their career. On the other, they’re your discovery—dang it—and you know you won’t be able to counter-offer the type of employer they can now attract. Or they decide to start their own company, emboldened and informed by the experience at yours. In the end, that’s okay. Sometimes a great hire’s growth trajectory is faster than a startup’s, and you can be grateful for having given them a chance to prove themselves and to find a new path that they wouldn’t have otherwise. That kind of hire will have likely made a major difference to your company and having trusted alumni out there in the world doing great things should be a source of pride and good industry karma for any CTO who discovered them. The best hires are self-driven, stoked by the ability to learn, to gain mastery of the craft, and by being able to show off their accomplishments to the rest of the team they want to impress. When you look at their track record, even when it’s not filled with household-name accolades and pedigrees, you will typically see breadcrumbs of exploration, toy projects and experimentation fueled by curiosity. It’s that classic desire to hack things and understand them. You don’t need to ask them to work a little harder, they know this is a big growth spurt for them and they want to take advantage of it. The company is giving them a valuable practice canvas for their skills and they want to make the most of this opportunity, which unfortunately isn’t that common. They love a challenge, they want to prove themselves, they love the work and they are excited by being around others who will push them to be their best. They would have been hacking on something interesting either way, but now you’re actually paying them to do it. They’re curious about how everything works: your company, the startup world, the industry they’re diving into, other disciplines, the tech they’re using. They’re learning, absorbing. Maybe they want to start their own thing one day, or maybe they’re set on using this gig as a ramp to something else they dream about. Maybe they just want the new optionality granted by having your company on their resume. They’re sponges and will gladly take on the challenges you send their way. I remember throwing a big Redux experiment at David in what must have been his first month at work. Again, no web dev experience prior to this. Nobody on the team knew the technology and he, hired as an infrastructure engineer with a background in physics and zero product engineering experience, had something up and running for us within days. He was pumped he got to do something so radically new for the team as one of his first assignments. Ultimately we decided the tech wasn’t a fit for our existing codebase, we scrapped the experiment, and he ran off to the next challenge with no loss of enthusiasm. At Double Dusk we could not figure out why players would regularly de-sync their character positions on the server when using a custom—and wildly complicated, due to needing to replicate Half Life 2-style movement to the smallest detail inside of Unreal Engine—character movement component in combination with our own Unreal Engine networking tweaks, making character movement authoritative on client instances of the game. A big deviation from the defaults. Our newly-hired star engineer, us being his first ever employer, had to dive into the pit of madness. He almost gave up several times before finally identifying all of the spots in the physics sub-stepping logic that was causing the drift across the network. I’m confident I myself would have gone completely bananas trying to debug that one. He was proud of the trust we had put in him, he was eager to learn, he didn’t want to let the team down, and I knew enough about him to make the bet that the challenge would have been just barely within his abilities. Hunger is a massive force-multiplier, and unlike many other traits, it doesn’t seem to be teachable. Failures will instill humility. Rejection will hone your EQ. But you’re either driven to compete, learn and prove yourself, or you’re not. No manager’s pep talk will kickstart that drive in you, at least not sustainably. The hubris has to come from somewhere much deeper. Startups are all about rapid experimentation, trying countless ideas that don’t work, and bootstrapping the skills and processes of the company as it figures out just what exactly people will pay for. Trust-building is critical in any team endeavor, and members who are unable to admit fault, who take up all of the space, and/or who need to be right at all costs will be a real problem as the company matures. The best hires are humble and will happily talk about both their victories and their biggest implosions, about what they learned from their misadventures, about talented past coworkers and how their efforts were part of a team. They rarely claim to have single-handedly carried everything on their backs. As you interview candidates searching for the best, many non-obvious great hires will be bad at behavioral interviews—or interviews in general, for that matter. They didn’t get extensive training on answering questions using the STAR method, didn’t drill stock responses to predictable and tired interview questions. They’re early-ish stage hands-on technology people, not smooth-talking execs jumping from one boardroom to the next. It is your job to fish for key nuggets of insight buried in the rough presentation. After you interview enough people with a similar set of standard questions, you’ll be able to spot the outliers in the bell curve of responses. An underrated aspect of humility in startups is detachment from one’s work. Companies in the process of inventing themselves need to actively cycle through many ideas, most of which will ultimately not stand the test of time. Design for the trash can and kill your darlings are important mindsets in creative work, and they extend far beyond music, film and games. Quantity leads to quality, and a great hire will accept regularly needing to apply a flamethrower to their work and try again with the new learnings from the latest experiment. They will not be precious about it, nor will they feel diminished by needing to try again. The Davids do not keep score; they keep trying and do the work knowing that there’s a good chance it will not go anywhere. That is also highly correlated with their ability to take feedback without taking it personally. They’re not afraid of criticism and quick feedback loops. In fact, they seek disconfirmation sooner rather than later. They have excellent feedback metabolism. Building technology companies is a team sport. Everything you do is with the help of other people, for the benefit of other people. As much as the startup world fetishizes the cracked ninja jedi 10x code-poet, if that person makes others never want to talk to them again, cracked they are not. Someone who is able to work with others’ quirks, understand how they operate and what they respond to, and act in a way that brings the best out of their teammates is worth their weight in gold. Brilliant jerks, as great as they are for producing riveting drama in TV shows, quickly become a net negative in the real world. We’re in the squishy human feeling territory here (aka “soft skills”) and you can’t LeetCode your way into knowing if someone will be an ass. There’s no FizzBuzz for empathy. You have to ask them standard questions, shoot the breeze, interact during the various testing phases of the interview, and outside, and ultimately make a call based on the limited data you have. You will never have all of the evidence, but ultimately you have to make a go or no-go call. Sometimes you get lucky and the candidate discloses a consistent pattern from their past that is obviously disqualifying, but often you don’t. How they interact with you and your team throughout the interview is usually a good data point, and that, of course, goes both ways. Regardless of how you investigate this side of them, it’s non-negotiable, and the best hires you’ll make will all have a high EQ. At the same time, someone highly empathetic, but who hides in a cave and is unable to coordinate their work with the rest of the software orchestra, is not the best. Great team players anticipate others’ questions and concerns, and are proactive about reaching out and communicating both their status and the progress of their work to those around them. They make their work visible instead of requiring constant polling for the team to figure out what exactly is going on with them. Remote environments in particular benefit from strong proactive communicators, as you can’t get away with always knowing what’s going on with everybody due to sitting in the same room for most of the week. One great Loom is worth a thousand words, but a thousand words is still much better than having to pull status out of people. Early stage startups move at a pace that generates tremendous entropy, and someone who’s able to coordinate with the rest of a team in a way that feels natural and effortless will allow the small teams to scale without requiring project management and complex processes meant for lower-performing contributors. Perhaps counterintuitively, I don’t fret too much about competence. To me, that’s a given. If your interview funnel is set up well, with a great take-home project, an onsite, or even a work trial, determining if the person you’re interviewing is competent should emerge naturally. After all, you and your team are technical experts, craftspeople who can look at another craftsperson’s work and quickly judge if it is any good. Yes, AI is getting pretty good these days and it’s becoming easy for candidates of all disciplines to hide behind prompts, but that’s only an extra reason to allow them to bring those tools into the interview itself and showcase their use rather than shamefully hide their existence. How they use the agents, the back-and-forth, the planning, the tweaking, the types of searches they do as part of the exercise are all valuable data points for determining competence, and you should allow candidates to surface them. In-person interviews and work trials are for now non-gameable, so if you’re extra paranoid, they are a great option. Non-obvious candidates will be in the hiring race with fewer other companies, possibly none, depending on your industry. That gives both you and them more flexibility and time to try working together for a few days before making it official. With a sufficiently relevant set of tasks for the work trial, you can rest assured that they’re competent, and learn a lot more about their other traits in the process. The best start-up hires are problem-solvers, not ticket resolvers. They want to understand what the business is trying to accomplish, what challenge is standing in the way of it, and how to make that problem go away. They’re autonomous in the best of ways. They don’t sit around waiting for someone to tell them what to do; they proactively find challenges and opportunities for improvement, iterate on the feedback, and go out of their way to help their teammates. They figure things out, and they do it without needing their hands held. Someone like David didn’t take no for an answer; he assumed there had to be a narrow path through the rejections he kept getting from me, that it was only a matter of his resourcefulness before he found a crack through which to get what he wanted. The communication, coordination and cohesion overheads that emerge with the addition of more and more staff to the roster are probably the toughest parts of scaling any business. A leader’s job is to streamline and remove these emergent dependencies between people and teams as much as possible. Besides keeping the number of hires low, the other powerful lever that a start-up CTO has is to hire people who will be self-sufficient and require little to no support to get their jobs done. They will ask for help when necessary, but they will take pride in figuring things out on their own, checking in with you when the time is right. They will require little supervision overall, and only direction when it comes to their work. If they’re falling behind, being great communicators, they will let the rest of the team know. If they’re early, they’ll gladly pick the next interesting opportunity to be useful. If they’re struggling, their pride in their work will make them double-down and overcome the challenge at all costs. In that case your job is to help them pump the brakes when necessary, or their pace can become unsustainable. A great startup hire doesn’t only think about their respective lane, but cares about the other disciplines around them that their work is impacting. They understand their angle, their priorities, and their expectations. For example: They think about where and how their work will land and anticipate those objections, addressing them in advance. They proactively reach out to those disciplines to avoid yet another coordination chokepoint that will only gobble up time. As more and more skills are compacting into one single individual, we see AI engineers, product engineers, and product managers becoming more technical and moving downstream into programming. This sort of cross-disciplinary mindset buys companies a ton of leverage and ability to iterate faster. Of course, this becomes progressively easier with experience and seniority. But that’s also why startups moving fast benefit from more mature contributors as time goes on. The reduced communication costs multiplied across more and more team members really add up over time. Unless you have very specific technical needs, having a generalist bias in the early days is a great idea. In fact we’re seeing more and more disciplines get compressed into one, with software developers covering UI, UX, PM and engineering, effectively becoming a cross-disciplinary team of one. Even in later stages, half-a-pizza teams powered by AI can move mountains on timelines that felt impossible just a few years ago. Early-stage startups are notoriously chaotic and unpredictable. You might be working on one feature one day, it might get cancelled the next day, and maybe now you’re fielding customer support calls for something you shipped that accidentally blew up. The next day you’re taking a trip to a customer site to chat with potential users. At no point do you know if any of this will make you money, how long until you kill that feature, and how many more of these iterations you’ll do before you either strike gold or the company runs out of money. There are no guarantees in the startup world, except for the fact that your runway will eventually reach zero if you don’t find something worth selling. As a CTO, it is your responsibility to shield your team from the messy everyday financial reality of where your company is headed. At the same time, I prefer to keep as much as possible in the open so that the team knows how much longer the music will play and when it’s time to start refreshing their LinkedIn profiles. I never want anything to be a surprise to the team when I could have been candid about it far in advance. It’s a fine balance between hiding the daily volatility—mostly of the founders’ moods and their confidence in the company making it—and exposing the long-term trends. This type of universe requires people who are okay with fewer guarantees. A startup will never have the time to run comprehensive studies, to build extensive plans, to gain all of the information necessary to make the right decision. Seeking perfection at the cost of an action is generally unacceptable, and you learn much more by failing in a valiant attempt than in delaying a perfect attempt that you might have validated months earlier by just doing the thing. Great hires respect that process and are willing to operate without all of the information, accepting that the team will figure it out as it moves forward, often deviating from the original objective. Deleting existing artifacts or completely pivoting to a new strategy on a dime is the ultimate startup superpower. Anybody who needs well-spelled-out plans and continuity in whatever they’re doing will ultimately struggle in that kind of environment. Hiring is a gamble, but you can tilt the odds in your favor if you stop playing the same game as everyone else. The “best” hire isn’t the person with the most GitHub stars or the flashiest resume; it’s the person who makes your team better by existing within it. It’s the David who breaks down doors and ends up shaping the direction of the company through their relentless contributions. Developing an eye for non-obvious talent is the only way to build a high-leverage team on a startup budget. Yes, it takes more work. It requires you to actually pay attention. It’s one of the hardest feats to pull off in startup team building. It means you must trust your own judgment over a candidate’s credentials. But if you do it right, you don’t just get a “nice” team, you get a team capable of doing the impossible. Now stop reading and go find “the best”. 28 Dec, 2025 | #cto #startups #leadership #management #hiring #recruiting #talent-acquisition #company-building Share: X HN LinkedIn Reddit Subscribe to the newsletter Hard-won lessons on software, startups, and leading teams.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes ticked higher Monday, while other markets made louder moves, including another record-breaking rush for the price of gold. The S&P 500 rose 0.5% and won back its losses from last week’s dip. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 313 points, or 0.6%, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.4%. Baker Hughes helped lead the way and rose 4.4% after delivering a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The energy technology company said it’s benefiting from strong momentum in demand for liquefied natural gas, among other things. CoreWeave climbed 5.7% after Nvidia said it invested $2 billion in the stock and will help accelerate the buildout of CoreWeave’s artificial-intelligence factories, which use Nvidia chips, by 2030 to advance AI adoption. Nvidia slipped 0.6%. USA Rare Earth rallied 7.9% after saying the U.S. government agreed to provide $277 million in federal funding to help the company produce heavy rare earths, minerals and magnets. The Trump administration also agreed to a proposed $1.3 billion loan, while the company separately raised $1.5 billion through private investors. Much of the rest of Wall Street was relatively quiet. That included mixed performances for airlines, which had to cancel thousands of flights due to the winter storm that swept much of the United States over the weekend. Delta Air Lines lost 0.7%, and Southwest Airlines added 0.2%. All told, the S&P 500 rose 34.62 points to 6,950.23. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 313.69 to 49,412.40, and the Nasdaq composite gained 100.11 to 23,601.36. The action was stronger in the gold market, where the metal’s price rallied another 2.1% and briefly topped $5,100 per ounce for the first time to set another record. Silver surged even more and settled 14% higher. Prices for precious metals have been soaring as investors look for safer places to park their money amid threats of tariffs, still-high inflation, political strife and mountains of debt for governments worldwide. The latest worry to pile atop the swelling list was President Donald Trump’s threat to impose a 100% tariff on goods from Canada if it signs a free trade deal with China. The U.S. dollar’s value also continued its recent slide against peers. Last week, it was U.S. tariff threats related to Greenland that drove some global investors away from the dollar. This time, it was the Japanese yen leaping sharply because of expectations that officials in both Japan and the United States may intervene in the market to prop up the Japanese currency’s value. More swings could be ahead for financial markets in a week full of big tests. The Federal Reserve will announce its latest move on interest rates on Wednesday. It’s been lowering its main interest rate and has indicated more cuts may be on the way in 2026 to help shore up the job market and give the economy a boost. Most economists expect it to hold steady on Wednesday, in part because inflation remains stubbornly above the Fed’s 2% target and lower rates could worsen it. Whatever the Fed decides, comments from its chair, Jerome Powell, following the decision could sway stock and bond markets. Several of Wall Street’s most influential stocks are also set to deliver their latest earnings reports this week. That includes Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla on Wednesday and Apple on Thursday. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.21% from 4.24% late Friday. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed amid mostly modest movements in Europe following some sharper swings in Asia. Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 1.8% for one of the world’s bigger moves. A stronger yen could hurt Japanese exporters, and Toyota Motor fell 4.1%. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed. Copyright 2026 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

UPDATED 11:33 EST / JANUARY 25 2026 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante and Erik Bradley At the beginning of each year, as is our tradition, we team up with Enterprise Technology Research to dig through the latest data and craft 10 predictions for the coming year. This year’s prognostication follows the publication where we grade our 2025 predictions. In this Breaking Analysis, we tap some of the most telling nuggets from ETR’s rich data set and put forth our top 10 predictions for enterprise tech in 2025. Most of the predictions below are backed up with data based on proprietary market intelligence from ETR’s Technology Spending Intentions Survey (TSIS) and its quarterly macro drill-down data, which surveys more than 1,700 business technology leaders. Each year we get thousands of inbound predictions from tech companies and thought leaders. We go through each one and categorize them. Every year the folder gets larger. In the graphic below we show the mix of topic areas. Of course everything is artificial intelligence, but we’ve tried to isolate those that were AI-specific. As always, security is top of mind for forecasters, as you can see with 25% of the inbounds. Our predictions this year span information technology spending, AI return on investment, Nvidia Corp.’s moat, data, large language models, cloud, changes to the software-as-a-service model, security, hardware pricing and the memory shortag, and the impact of AI on jobs. Let’s dive into the detail. The first prediction is: IT budgets rise about 5% in 2026. Since COVID, organizations have dealt with sustained pressure on IT budgets as interest rates rose and uncertainty dominated. Geopolitical tensions, wars, tariffs and related shocks have kept decision-makers cautious. Against that backdrop, ETR’s quarterly macro drill-down shows IT decision makers currently expecting a 4.6% budget increase. The call at 5% is a modest step above the mean, with notable divergence in large enterprises – they remain more conservative at under 4% – while the C-suite and Asia-Pacific respondents are more optimistic. The data is moving in the right direction. The forward spending outlook has improved meaningfully versus earlier surveys, with a notable jump from the first October survey when respondents were asked for the first time about forward spend into January. In the current survey, 74% of respondents indicate they plan to increase spending, the highest level since January 2022. This suggests the optimism is not isolated to a single segment. The large-enterprise caution is a concern, however, but even within the Fortune 500, the trend is improving, rising by more than a percentage point survey-over-survey. The C-suite cut comes in above the mean at 5.2%, reinforcing that senior leadership sentiment is leaning more aggressively toward growth than the broader population. An important nuance is what this metric represents. This is IT budget data – not vendor revenue. It includes staffing and related internal costs and should not be conflated with market forecasts from firms such as IDC and Gartner forecasting vendor revenue growth. Over time, budgets are likely to evolve as the data center buildout expands access to token-based services and as organizations scale up with less headcount. Staffing is one of the largest line items in IT budgets, and AI-driven productivity and automation will influence that mix going forward. The near-term focus, however, is the 2026 budget direction of roughly 5%, reflected in the survey. The second prediction is that 2026 becomes the year enterprises start seeing AI ROI at scale. In prior years, our prediction was that ROI would remain elusive. The data is now moving in a different direction, with signs of a productivity increasing and more evidence that enterprises are beginning to operationalize AI in ways that sustain returns. The ROI story is aligning around two themes: 1) Measurement discipline and 2) Scaling outcomes. Early in the cycle, organizations were spending heavily while a large portion of the market either was not measuring ROI or had not seen any return. In November 2024, combining “not measuring ROI” with “had not seen ROI” put the total near 50%, a concerning gap between investment intensity and financial confidence. That gap is narrowing. The most important shift is that more organizations are measuring ROI. The share that is not measuring dropped from 27% to 18%, and a rise in financial-operations adoption in the ETR data signals that enterprises are putting cost controls and accountability structures around AI spending. Six to eight months ago, FinOps barely surfaced in insights panels and interviews. Now it is showing up constantly, which tracks with a market moving from experimentation to governance and operational rigor. The data also shows incremental improvement in realized ROI bands. The 1% to 10% ROI bucket has fluctuated but has steadily increased since November 2024. That supports the view that organizations are beginning to realize returns and are learning how to align AI initiatives with measurable outcomes. A key nuance is what enterprises expect ROI to be. In the ETR AI series data, 66% of respondents say AI ROI comes from cost efficiency and margin improvement. Only 23% expect ROI to come from revenue growth or new product creation. That distribution is relevant because it explains why FinOps is rising and why measurement is becoming central. If most ROI is expected to come from margin and efficiency, auditing and control of usage and spend becomes a prerequisite for declaring success. The third prediction comes out of research published earlier this month following Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang’s keynote at CES. The call is that Nvidia widens its lead over the broader graphics processing unit/tensor processing unit/application-specific integrated circuit pack because its cost per token advantage improves materially in 2026. A key factor is Nvidia’s CES disclosure that its latest GPU Vera Rubin is in full production and will ramp this year. The data shared at CES pointed to a rapid step-function improvement over Blackwell delivered in roughly 12 months: 5X performance, 10X throughput, and a 10X improvement in token cost. That combination of higher output and far lower unit costs is expected to drive a significant uptake in demand. The demand premise is based on Jevons Paradox – as price declines, consumption rises – and the prediction is that the cost-per-token reduction contributes to a 15X increase in demand. Against that backdrop, we expect the narrative that TPUs and ASICs are eroding Nvidia’s moat will itself erode, and the expectation is that Nvidia’s financial metrics will will reflect the magnitude of this advantage. Nvidia’s price-to-earnings ratio is hovering in the mid-20s – even lower than Walmart – and that multiple increases as investors internalize the sustainability of Nvidia’s position. It’s possible and even likely that some GPU designers will pivot to edge use cases or cancel programs. Looking ahead, our expectation is that Nvidia faces effectively no competition in the data center except where demand cannot be met. That unmet demand supports alternatives, but the path for competitors goes through inference and workloads at the edge. Our view is that Nvidia also performs well at the edge, with the addition of a lock-up a deal with Groq. Demand continues to outstrip supply, which means suppliers broadly sell what they can ship. The implication is that the best news for competitors is the current “rising tide” environment lifts all chip boats, and suppliers have little incentive to see that dynamic change soon. We believe data gravity increasingly benefits database platform incumbents as enterprises build AI capabilities on top of their existing ecosystems. Using Snowflake Inc. as an example, the data suggests that add-on services to a core data platform – like Cortex – become a natural extension of the underlying database. The core platform remains sticky, and that stickiness increases as customers pull adjacent workloads into the same ecosystem. In our view, this dynamic extends beyond Snowflake to other major incumbents, including Databricks Inc., Oracle Corp. and Microsoft Corp. This chart above has two parts that reinforce the prediction. Specifically, when teams build AI applications, they tend to stay close to the database ecosystem where their data already lives – and that shows up in spending intentions. Starting on the right-hand graphic: This comes from ETR’s build-versus-buy AI series and looks only at respondents who say they are building their own AI applications. The y-axis is Paired Usage Likelihood Impact, which is a way of showing how strongly two components show up together in the same tech stack. Using Snowflake as the clearest example in this cut, the chart shows that when customers adopt Snowflake Cortex Search, they are far more likely to adopt additional Snowflake components. Specifically: In our view, this is the data gravity effect in practice. Once a customer is anchored in a Snowflake-led workflow for one element of the AI stack, the probability increases that adjacent elements – search, vector search or vector database style capabilities, and model-related components – remain inside the same ecosystem. Now move to the left-hand graphic: This is from ETR’s Technology Spending Intentions Survey and shows Snowflake Net Score (spending momentum) trends over time across three categories that relate to this prediction: Each cluster shows snapshots over five time points spanning from Jan 2025 to Jan 2026. The chart headline says it all: “Gains in Database and Analytics drives aggregate Snowflake recovery.” The data suggests a meaningful rebound in Snowflake’s core database and analytics momentum showing up in 2026, with Database/Data Warehousing notably jumping back up versus the prior quarters, and Analytics showing a similar recovery pattern. ML/AI remains elevated but comparatively steadier across the period. The bottom line is that we see a pull toward the incumbent’s database ecosystem when organizations are building their own AI applications. Snowflake is the clearest example in this dataset. When customers are using Snowflake for one layer of their stack, they are more likely to stay in the Snowflake ecosystem for adjacent capabilities including search, vector search, vector database and foundational model usage combined with other stack elements. This in our view highlights the predictive value of the ETR dataset as a leading indicator. In prior market shifts, Breaking Analysis observed survey data that flagged early movement, including the work-from-home wave and its impact on vendors such as CrowdStrike Holdings Inc., Okta Inc. and Zscaler Inc. We have seen similar leading signals in the rise of Snowflake and Databricks, periods of softening that preceded market repricing and subsequent rebounds. The data suggests the current resurgence is part of that same pattern of early signal preceding broader market recognition. The message is that platform incumbency is compounding in the sense that as enterprises build AI applications, they consolidate more of the stack around the database ecosystem they already trust, and the data suggests Snowflake is currently the clearest beneficiary of that gravity with a measurable resurgence in spending intent. We believe 2026 is the inflection year where leading model providers optimize around enterprise adoption, not just model benchmarks and consumer buzz. Our bet is that OpenAI follows Anthropic’s enterprise posture more aggressively, uses consumer scale as leverage, and exits 2026 with enterprise revenue that surpasses Anthropic’s. In parallel, we expect OpenAI to pressure Google’s search economics, and we expect Elon Musk’s Grok to pursue edge-oriented opportunities where he already has a strategic footprint. The chart above shows where model and AI platforms sit inside enterprise accounts today, using two dimensions from ETR’s TSIS. First, read the plots. Each dot is a vendor. The x-axis is Overlap %, which we use here as a proxy for pervasion and account penetration across the dataset. The y-axis is Shared Net Score, which represents spending momentum among the accounts where the vendor is present. The red dotted line at 40% is the “highly elevated momentum” threshold. The upper-right corner is the power position indicating high penetration and high momentum. That is where Microsoft and OpenAI Group PBC sit in the January 2026 survey and have for some time. Amazon Web Services Inc. and Google LLC are clustered close together in the upper-middle portion, reflecting strong momentum and meaningful overlap. Databricks and Snowflake sit near one another as well, which fits our prior prediction on data gravity and platform pull-through. Anthropic PBC is high on the y-axis with strong momentum, sitting above the red line with notable progress since last year. Meta Platforms Inc.’s Llama is well below the threshold and has fallen out of the leadership conversation in this dataset (and the market) relative to the leaders. In the lower-left are the legacy machine learning and AI players fighting for relevance on both overlap and momentum. Second, use the table on the right to anchor the scatter with exact numbers. For JAN26 Shared Net Score and Shared N, Anthropic leads at 72.5% (345), followed by Microsoft at 65.5% (795) and OpenAI at 60.7% (677). Databricks comes in at 58.8% (250). AWS and Google are tied at 58.0% with Shared N of 450 and 483, respectively. Snowflake is at 47.5% (265) and Meta Llama at 29.9% (137). Pervasion on the x-axis is the leading indicator to watch as this shifts from experimentation to enterprise standardization. OpenAI is already near 40% pervasion versus Anthropic at roughly 20%, while most other players remain in single digits. Anthropic doubled pervasion from about 10% to 20% in a year, but OpenAI’s starting position is meaningfully more entrenched inside enterprise environments. That penetration advantage is relevant to our prediction because we believe it makes the consumer volume a feature for enterprise, not a bug. OpenAI’s distribution, usage patterns and familiar interface create gravity that increasingly supports enterprise use cases and API-driven deployments. Recent data suggests that OpenAI’s API added more than $1 billion in annualized revenue run rate last month alone, which reflects enterprise-driven revenue generation and evidence the platform is moving beyond a consumer chatbot phase. In our view, once that enterprise flywheel starts spinning, it continues to gain momentum. On Google, our prediction extends beyond model performance, where Gemini has made truly impressive strides. We believe OpenAI’s recent moves around advertising are aimed at pressuring Google’s core economics. Search queries cost fractions of pennies, AI queries are far more expensive (100X), and we expect OpenAI to keep testing ways to insert itself and disrupt Google’s advertising economics. Though Microsoft’s earlier attempts to AI-ify Bing did not deliver the intended results, we believe OpenAI’s scale and positioning give it a better chance. On Grok, we expect a push to the edge. Elon had explored designing a data center GPU, then backed away from that path as Nvidia’s lead became more obvious. At the same time, Tesla Inc. already operates with an edge-oriented chip design capability built around Arm and customized neural processing units, or NPUs, for vehicles. We believe Grok strengthens that position, with continued silicon innovation focused at the edge while xAI Holdings Corp. scales data center capacity rapidly in Memphis – with a high priority position in Nvidia’s allocation queue. Longer-term, theCUBE Research work by George Gilbert and David Floyer suggests that leading LLM companies could evolve into a new breed of software delivered through application programming interfaces, making adoption easier for enterprises without deep engineering chops. We do not expect that full transformation to be obvious in 2026, but we believe it ties directly to the multiyear shift from legacy IT spend toward token generation and more AI-ified operating models. The message is that enterprise penetration and spending momentum are converging around a small set of leaders, and the data suggests OpenAI has the distribution advantage to translate consumer scale into enterprise-standard deployments, with Anthropic setting the pace on momentum, and Google and AWS clustered tightly – Google having the advantage in proprietary models — and Grok positioning for edge-driven differentiation over time. We believe Google Cloud Platform continues closing the gap on AWS and Azure in 2026, driven primarily by its prowess in AI, reinforced by a world-class data foundation, and supported by improving profitability. As shown below, while GCP still trails in enterprise penetration, the leading indicators in spending intent suggest momentum is shifting in Google’s favor, particularly inside large enterprises. Google Cloud Platform is showing sustained momentum. The starting point is growth and operating leverage. By our estimates, GCP grew roughly 40% last quarter. Alphabet discloses Google Cloud overall rather than GCP specifically, but we believe GCP is growing meaningfully faster than the consolidated cloud segment. At the same time, Google Cloud operating margins have moved into the black and are now in the mid-20s, and moving in a direction we see as increasingly encouraging for a scaled cloud business. In our opinion, those margins continue to expand as the business matures, and that translates into meaningful cash generation over time. The ETR data above reinforces the momentum. In the core spending intent datasets, GCP is the only one of the Big Three cloud providers showing year-over-year Net Score acceleration, while AWS and Azure both declined. Penetration remains lower – pervasion trails those two, particularly versus Azure – but the direction of spend intent is moving up. The spending intent improvements are not confined to smaller accounts. The increase shows up in Fortune 100, Fortune 500 and Global 2000 cohorts, which historically have been harder for Google to penetrate. We believe that shift reflects Google’s broader enterprise prowess – more credibility with the largest organizations and more proof points that GCP can run mission-critical workloads at scale. ETR’s AI series data provides more evidence to explain why this is happening now. We see rising usage across Google’s AI build stack, including Gemini and Vertex AI, with gains survey over survey. In our view, Google’s positioning as both a foundational model provider and a cloud hosting platform is becoming more integrated, and that integration is beginning to show up in customer behavior. We also believe Google’s approach has benefited from patience. The company has the capital to play a longer game. As operating margins climb toward the levels sustained by AWS over many quarters – and as Azure continues to benefit from software contribution – we expect Google to keep expanding profitability while it builds share. That is the combination that changes perception with accelerating demand plus improving margins. The message is that Google’s cloud business is entering a new phase where AI-led demand, improving enterprise traction and expanding operating margins work together, and the survey data suggests GCP is the only Big Three provider accelerating on Net Score while extending its relevance with the largest global organizations. We believe 2026 marks a transition year for software-as-a-service monetization. Seat-based pricing has been misaligned with customer value for a long time, and AI amplifies that tension by changing how work gets done and how many users need direct licenses. At the same time, SaaS vendors have deep entrenchment in enterprise process logic and trusted data, and in our view that gives them leverage to preserve and grow revenue even as seat growth moderates. The prediction is not a SaaS collapse. The prediction is that pricing evolves, with a shift toward outcome-based and AI-inclusive monetization showing up in the numbers. The graphic above is a two-parter designed to answer the question “Does AI reduce SaaS seats, and if it does, does revenue fall with it?” The top row focuses on seats. The bottom row focuses on spend offsets. Start with the top-left table: “AI Impact on Core Software Seats – NOV25 AI Product Series.” It breaks results by customer type and shows the percentage expecting more seats versus same seats versus less seats, then summarizes the net “seat offset.” The seat offset is positive for small and medium-sized businesses (+12%) and modestly positive for the total sample (+4%). It turns negative as you move upmarket to the Global 2000 (-1%), Large (-2%) and Fortune 500 (-8%). The message is that the biggest organizations are the ones most likely to see seat pressure. Now look to the top-right table: “Seat Offset Over Time.” It shows how that seat offset is trending from NOV24 to MAY25 to NOV25. The direction is consistent in that net seat impact is moving down over time, especially in larger cohorts. Global 2000 moves from +11% to +5% to -1%, and Large moves from +17% to +7% to -2%. Fortune 500 shifts from +6% to 0% to -8%. Seat growth is moderating, and in large enterprises it is flipping negative. Now move to the bottom-left table: “AI Spend Offset for Reductions in Seat Spending – NOV25 AI Product Series.” This is the follow-up question asking even if seats decline, does AI-related spend compensate? Respondents are asked whether AI spend will exceed, match, or fall short of any reduction in seat spend. In the Global 2000 row, 51% say AI spend exceeds the seat reduction, 33% say it matches, and 15% say it falls short. That pattern indicates monetization moving from seats toward AI and outcomes. Finally, bolster the conclusion with the bottom-right table: “AI Spend Net Impact Over Time.” This compresses the prior view into a single net impact metric over time. In NOV25, SMB shows 38%, Global 2000 shows 36%, and All Respondents shows 30%. Fortune 500 and Large are lower at 27% and 25% respectively, but still positive. Even in cohorts where seat offsets are negative, the net spend impact remains meaningfully positive. This is why we believe the market’s “SaaS is dead” and the “SaaS-Attack” narrative is overstated. Seat counts can be pressured while revenue grows if vendors successfully reprice around AI, usage and outcomes. We also believe the public commentary from large SaaS vendors aligns with this dynamic. Specifically, customers are asking for help operationalizing AI, and vendors are embedding AI into the products where data, metadata and business process logic already live. The message is that AI creates real headwinds for SaaS seat expansion, especially in the largest enterprises, but the spend data suggests SaaS vendors preserve and grow revenue by shifting monetization toward AI, usage and outcomes – a pricing evolution, not a SaaS collapse. We believe 2026 produces a new class of breach that most security teams are not prepared to contain — specifically, a major SaaS incident where no human credentials are stolen. Additionally, the attack vector is agentic, coordinated across multiple SaaS platforms, and executed by multiple AI agents from different vendors. The novelty is a logic hack, not a credential hack, set off by a prompt injection or agent-to-agent manipulation that redirects an agent’s behavior, spreads laterally via trusted integrations, and moves at machine speed across the digital supply chain. This prediction builds on a related warning from one of our inbounds that came from Shahar Man, CEO and co- founder of Backslash Security. In November 2025, he predicted, “A major MCP breach will define the AI coding threat model – We’ll see in 2026, the first large- scale breach originating from MCP.” What we saw with the Anthropic hack was related and supported the direction of Shahar’s prediction. We’re building on that prediction and expecting something broader. The breach we are forecasting involves one agent reprogramming another through prompt injection, then using MCP connections across SaaS platforms to jump domains – finance, HR, supply chain – potentially spanning multiple vendors and even multiple companies. In our view, agents become bridgeheads meaning once a nonhuman identity is granted access and can influence adjacent agents, the blast radius expands quickly. Some are referring to this as a polyagent breach, where the infection doesn’t just stay in one system. The security implication is disconcerting. Antivirus is blind to this class of attack because there is no traditional malware signature. Firewalls do not help because the agents are executing authorized actions within permitted domains. Phishing campaigns often take weeks or months to coordinate with humans. An agent-driven breach can propagate at machine speed, chaining together permissions and actions faster than human response loops can keep up. To defend this, organizations will need to put in things such as AI honeypot tokens to lure the bad agents, semantics that scan every agentic conversation, and much more sophisticated defense systems that most organizations won’t have in place in 2026. A credible path is identity-first controls and agent governance. Nonhuman identities require zero-trust security, full stop. They must be governed, continuously monitored and treated as untrusted by default. The risk is structural in that if one agent has access that was legitimately granted, and it can influence another agent, the effective access boundary expands beyond what the organization intended. The market is already signaling urgency. Within the CISO community, agentic AI governance, protection and security is again a top topic. Qualitative trend data suggests that identity-centric and zero-trust principles are among the top priorities, and the mandate is moving from theory to budget and operations. The vendor landscape is also shifting toward identity-centric consolidation and platform plays. The Palo Alto Networks Inc.-CyberArk Software Ltd. acquisition is a clear example of this direction. The practitioner requirement is for improved visibility, better decisioning based on data, and the ability to leverage identity intelligence as a defense mechanism. Security operations teams are already adopting agentic AI for triaging alerts and initial investigations, but the identity side is where the value becomes critical because identity is where the permissions live. This relates with a broader dynamic we track every year – tool sprawl and consolidation intent versus consolidation reality. Practitioners consistently express interest in reducing tool counts, but the data shows limited actual consolidation so far. That creates exposure. Platform vendors argue they are seeing consolidation power their business. Practitioners largely agree consolidation is desirable and also acknowledge it is not happening fast enough to reduce risk materially. The message here is that agentic systems expand the attack surface into a new domain where credentials are not stolen and malware is not planted, rather agent behavior is redirected. In our view, 2026 is the year this becomes visible in a major SaaS breach, and the organizations that are not operating identity-first, zero-trust governance for nonhuman identities are exposed to a class of risk that moves faster than their current defenses and operating models can respond. We believe hardware pricing remains elevated through 2026 and persists into 2027, driven by an ongoing memory shortage and a supply chain that is being reoriented around data center demand. High-bandwidth memory, NAND and RAM are in tight supply as data centers absorb capacity, and we expect that dynamic to keep pressure on pricing well beyond a normal cycle. In our view, this becomes a competitive differentiator for suppliers and OEMs that can secure allocation wins. Notably, buyers face a tougher refresh environment in 2026. The chart above captures two things: 1) How respondents say hardware prices have moved recently; and 2) How that pricing trend has shifted over time. Start with the distribution in the center. Respondents are asked: To what extent have vendors lowered or raised prices in the past six months compared to seven to twelve months ago? The responses are concentrated on the “raised” side. A meaningful portion of the sample reports increases in the mid-single digits and above, with a large block indicating raised by 3% to 5% as the most common outcome, followed by raised by 6% to 10% and additional cohorts seeing even larger jumps. At the high end, roughly 25% of respondents say prices rose 6% to 20% or more, which is a significant inflation indicator for hardware buyers. Now anchor that with the time series on the right. The average change in hardware pricing bottomed in late 2024 at roughly 2% to 2.5%. Since then, the average has risen by about a full percentage point, reaching 3.6% in the latest survey. The implication is that hardware price inflation is not fading as a temporary post-pandemic trend. It is re-accelerating at a time when many organizations would normally be entering a refresh cycle. We believe the supply-demand imbalance drives the continued trend, driven by AI factory demand. Vendors benefit from the current dynamic and have little incentive to rush pricing back down. Data center demand is being prioritized, and memory constraints ripple into everything from servers to storage to enterprise infrastructure to PCs. In our view, that is why terms like “AI-optimized” become mainstream marketing language, especially in PCs – memory becomes the gating factor, and vendors position optimization as product differentiation while supply remains constrained. We also believe this has second-order effects across the enterprise stack. Hardware refresh cycles influence demand for adjacent categories that ride on those refreshes, including security appliances and networking infrastructure. As pricing pressure persists, refresh timing and configuration decisions will become more constrained, with related impacts for vendors across the infrastructure and security landscape. Finally, we expect supply chain execution to be a competitive differentiator. Nvidia is likely to remain prioritized in the data center supply chain. On the PC side, it becomes a knife fight where scale and supply chain strength matter. Apple has scale. Dell is moving aggressively into consumer PCs and has a world-class supply chain. Storage vendors are already leaning into efficiency messaging, (for example, Vast Data Inc.’s flash efficiency messaging) and we expect more of that as the market stays constrained. The message is that the hardware market is entering a prolonged period where memory-driven constraints keep prices higher for longer, supply chain access becomes a competitive weapon, and buyers face a more expensive refresh cycle that reverberates across infrastructure categories well into 2027. We believe 2026 is the crossover year when AI’s impact on white-collar employment becomes visible in a way that is measurable and broadly acknowledged. The early impact is already seen in junior and entry-level roles, and this shows up in the data, first as headcount avoidance and then scaling without labor. In parallel, we expect sustained growth in blue-collar roles tied to the data center buildout – specialized trades and technical operators such as “artisan” plumbers, HVAC engineers, builders and cooling experts – where demand is already high and rising. The ETR survey data is already moving in the direction of this prediction. In July 2025, 21% of respondents said they were limiting future headcount due to AI. That figure has increased to 30% in the latest read. This trend is more pronounced in larger firms, which we see as the leading indicator. Among Global 2000 organizations, the number rises to 34%. Among Fortune 100 companies, 42% say they plan to limit future headcount because of AI. The message is that the larger the organization, the more aggressive the posture on future headcount constraints tied directly to AI. We are also seeing movement from avoidance to reduction. Strategic headcount reduction attributed to AI is rising more slowly than avoidance, but the increase from 14% to 18% in roughly half a year is material. These are not marginal shifts, and they are not based on a small or anecdotal sample. The survey represents roughly 1,800 qualified IT experts and IT decision-makers across industries, which makes the directional signal difficult to dismiss. We believe this sits inside a larger pattern that plays out in major technology transitions. Over successive waves – mainframes to PCs, then the internet, cloud, mobile, social and big data – markets tend to reward the new before the new is large enough to offset the decline in the old. That mismatch creates volatility and shifting narratives. We see it today in sector rotation and sentiment – semiconductors in favor, SaaS out of favor – and we expect those narratives to continue shifting. The sensible approach is to focus on the data, filter out headline noise and track the adoption signals that show up in spending behavior and operating model changes. In our opinion, AI is larger than prior waves because it stands on the shoulders of them all. It changes the unit economics of work, and that shows up first in constrained hiring and then in reductions as organizations learn where automation is durable. Over time, we expect labor demand to rebalance, with new job creation tied to physical infrastructure and AI-enabled industries, but 2026 is positioned to be the year where the labor displacement data becomes hard to ignore. The message is that 2026 becomes the year AI’s labor impact is visible in enterprise headcount decisions at scale, led by hiring constraints in the largest organizations and followed by rising reductions, while demand for specialized blue-collar roles expands alongside the data center buildout and the broader AI infrastructure wave. We’re beyond the first inning of this AI era, which started really in 2017 with research papers on diffusion models and transformers. The ChatGPT moment exposed AI’s potential to the masses and now we’re entering the enterprise adoption phase, which we see as the real opportunity. How you see 2026 shaping up?

Title: Brex and The Pros and Cons of Hubristic Fundraising

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts, Fundraising Capital One just announced it’s acquiring Brex for $5.15 billion. An incredible, top 0.1% “exit” in less than 10 years from a category creator that created massive wealth and opportunities. A huge win. But also … less than half of Brex’s $12.3 billion valuation from October 2022. Should anyone care? Many are seeing is a failure vs Ramp, a measured success at best. But … why? I don’t think most people commenting on this actually understand what they’re reacting to. What they’re really feeling—even if they can’t articulate it—is the consequences of hubristic fundraising. And we should probably talk about it. Because hubristic fundraising is back. In a big way. It was back big time in 2025 and is back even bigger time in 2026. Let me define it simply: Hubristic fundraising is when you raise at a valuation so aggressive, with terms so favorable, with a narrative so bold, that you are essentially betting the entire future of your company on hitting an extraordinary outcome. It’s not just “raising a lot of money.” Plenty of companies raise hundreds of millions without hubris. Hubristic fundraising is when you: These deals can work out. It will work out for Databricks, Anthropic, etc. But at least as of when I write this, there are so very few $30B+ IPOs or exits. And that’s what Brex was promising. ElevenLabs, Harvey, Replit/Lovable, Cursor etc. are promising even more. Brex checked all these boxes. In 2021 and 2022, they raised at valuations that implied they would not just win corporate cards and expense management—they would dominate financial services for startups, then enterprises, then… everyone, apparently. Stupidest behavior I've seen on @brexHQ getting acquired by @CapitalOne for $5.15B: – Saying Brex "lost"– Mocking Brex for the outcome– Claiming investors lost money If losing means starting a business that gets sold for over $5B in 9 years, where both founders make hundreds… — JC Bahr-de Stefano (@jbahrdestefano) January 23, 2026 Let’s remember what 2021 looked like. Zero interest rates. SPACs everywhere. Tiger Global doing deals in 48 hours. Multiples that would make a 1999 VC blush. Brex raised $300 million at a $12.3 billion valuation in October 2022—technically 2022, but really the tail end of the 2021 madness before rates spiked and everything crashed. At that valuation, with maybe $200-250M in revenue at the time, Brex was being valued at 50x+ revenue. For a low gross margin corporate card and expense management company. In a market with Ramp, Mercury, Airbase, Navan, and others all competing furiously. Was that valuation justified by fundamentals? No. Was it justified by the fundraising environment and competitive dynamics of the moment? Absolutely. And that’s the trap of hubristic fundraising. In the moment, it feels not just rational but necessary. Hubristic fundraising works. At least for a while. And sometimes forever. When you’re the $12 billion company and your competitor is the $3 billion company, who do the Stanford MBAs and Google PMs want to join? The big number wins. The paper gains look better. The press coverage is better. The LinkedIn flex is better. Brex recruited absolute killers in 2021-2022. Engineers from Stripe. Execs from everywhere. One of the best sales teams ever under Sam Blond. That was partly product and vision—but it was also the massive valuation signaling “this is the winner.” This one is circular but real. Raise at a huge valuation, and suddenly more investors want in. FOMO is the most powerful force in venture capital. The $12.3B valuation wasn’t a barrier to raising more—it was a magnet for investors who wanted to be part of “the next big thing.” Enterprise customers want to work with winners. When Brex was valued at $12B and their competitor was valued at $2B, which one do more conservative customers feel comfortable signing a multi-year deal with? The big number creates legitimacy. It signals staying power. Every funding round becomes news. Every executive hire becomes news. You’re always in the conversation. That awareness compounds. When you’re raising at $12B and your competitor just raised at $1.5B, you are sending a message: we are going to outspend you on everything. Sales. Marketing. R&D. Acquisitions. Some competitors will give up. Others will make mistakes trying to keep up. Ramp didn’t give up. But many others did. Now for the dark side. This is the big one. And it’s what I think people are actually reacting to with Brex without realizing it. When you raise at a hubristic valuation, you attract employees, investors, and partners who are there for the outcome, not the mission. They’re there because they did the math on their equity and saw an IPO at $25B+ and early retirement. That’s fine when everything is going up and to the right. But the moment you hit turbulence—and every company hits turbulence—those mercenaries disappear. They have no patience for struggle. They didn’t sign up for hard mode. They signed up for paper gains. Brex went through brutal layoffs in 2024. Lost 20% of the company. Massive executive turnover. Struggled with burn. Had to do a full “Brex 3.0” turnaround that CEO Pedro Franceschi admirably pulled off. But where were the fans during that turnaround? Where were all the people celebrating Brex’s dominance in 2021? Gone. Because they were never fans. They were mercenaries betting on an outcome, not a company. Brex just sold for $5.15 billion. In cash and stock. To a major bank. Creating liquidity for everyone. Is that a failure? We’re already seeing this play out in real-time in AI. Look at Windsurf. Windsurf (formerly Codeium) was one of the hottest AI coding startups. They had $82 million in ARR with enterprise revenue doubling quarterly. OpenAI offered $3 billion to acquire them. When that deal fell apart, Google paid $2.4 billion in a reverse acqui-hire for the CEO, co-founder, and 40 senior staff. Cognition then scooped up the remaining assets—the product, IP, 210 employees, and the entire $82M ARR business—for a reported $250 million. Total value captured: roughly $2.65 billion. And yet? The narrative in Silicon Valley was that Windsurf “sold too cheap.” SaaStr literally published “Did Windsurf Sell Too Cheap?” The deal was framed as a cautionary tale, a fire sale, a disappointment. Think about that. A company with $82 million ARR that didn’t exist three years ago returned $2.65 billion to stakeholders. In any other era, that’s a legendary outcome. But when Cursor is valued at $29.3 billion? When Lovable hits $6.6 billion with $200 million ARR? Suddenly $2.65 billion for $82 million ARR feels like leaving money on the table. That’s hubristic fundraising distorting reality. The benchmarks have become so warped that even massive wins feel like losses. For Ribbit Capital, who led the Series A, this is a monster return. For employees who joined early, this is life-changing money. For the customers using the product, nothing changes except they get the backing of a major financial institution. But because the peak valuation was $12.3B, the narrative is “Brex failed.” They got acquired at a “steep discount.” They “crashed.” This is insane. A $5B+ exit is an incredible outcome for any company. But hubristic fundraising creates hubristic expectations. And anything short of those expectations feels like failure—even when it objectively isn’t. When you’ve raised at $12B, you can’t think about $5B exits. You can’t consider acqui-hires or smaller strategic deals. Every decision has to be oriented around justifying that massive valuation. This leads to over-expansion, over-hiring, and over-spending. Brex’s $17 million/month burn in Q4 2023 was a direct consequence of trying to grow into a $12B valuation. For Brex to have “succeeded” by the mercenary definition, they probably needed to IPO at $20B+ or get acquired for $15B+. In the fintech market of 2023-2025. With rising rates. With competitors like Ramp breathing down their neck. That’s an almost impossible bar. And when you don’t clear it, everyone who joined for the outcome—and only the outcome—writes you off. Here’s the thing that should concern everyone: we’re doing this again. And in the Age of AI, we’re doing it at a scale that makes 2021 look quaint. Look at Ramp. In 2025 alone, they went from $13B to $16B to $22.5B to $32B. Four funding rounds in one year. Nearly tripling their valuation in twelve months. Is Ramp a great company? Of course. They hit $1B+ in ARR in record time. They’re cash flow positive. They’ve executed brilliantly. But four rounds in one year? A $32B valuation for an expense management company? This is 2021 fundraising playbook all over again. Except now, in AI, it’s 2021 on steroids. Let me share some numbers that should make your head spin. Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab raised $2 billion in a seed round. Not Series A. Not Series B. A seed round. At a $12 billion valuation. Before shipping a product. The former OpenAI CTO walks out the door and six months later has a company valued higher than Brex just sold for. And it gets crazier. Bloomberg reported Thinking Machines is now in discussions to raise additional funding at a $50 billion valuation. Even with their CTO having just quit with several other top team members to go back to OpenAI. That would be a 4x markup in less than a year. For a company that just launched its first product in October. Ilya Sutskever’s Safe Superintelligence raised over $1 billion for his AI safety startup. The former OpenAI Chief Scientist hasn’t shipped anything public yet. But billions? Sure, here you go. Harvey, the legal AI company, went from $3B to $5B to $8B across three funding rounds in 2025 alone. They raised $760 million in a single year. They 2.7x’d their valuation in ten months. For an AI tool that helps lawyers do due diligence faster. ElevenLabs went from $1.1B (January 2024) to $3.3B (January 2025) to $6.6B (September 2025). That’s 6x in less than two years. A voice synthesis company is now worth more than Brex sold for. Lovable, the Swedish “vibe coding” startup, went from $1.8B in July to $6.6B in December. They 3.5x’d in five months. They’re barely a year old. Cursor went from under $10B to $29.3B in a single year. They raised $2.3B in their Series D. That’s not a funding round—that’s an entire unicorn in a single check. We are now regularly seeing what would have been considered absurd even in 2021: billion-dollar seed rounds, valuations that exceed Brex’s exit for companies that haven’t shipped products, and 3-4x markups in less than a year. Is this driven by real innovation? In many cases, yes. AI is genuinely transformative. Is this also hubristic? Also yes. The same dynamics apply, just amplified. These valuations require these companies to not just succeed but to dominate. They require AI to transform every industry exactly as promised, on exactly the timeline investors are betting on. They require no major regulatory setbacks, no compute shortages, no technical plateaus. And they’re attracting the same mercenaries—talent, capital, and partners who are there for the paper gains, not the mission. Some of these companies will hit their numbers and the valuations will prove justified. ElevenLabs has real revenue. Harvey has real customers. Cursor has $1B ARR. The AI revolution is real. But many won’t hit their numbers. And when they don’t—when the inevitable correction comes—we’ll see the same pattern: mercenaries leaving, narratives turning, “failures” that are actually $3-5B exits, founders blamed for outcomes that were structurally locked in the moment they took hubristic valuations. The difference this time? The numbers are bigger. The falls will be harder. And the schadenfreude will be even more intense. When Thinking Machines is worth $50B and comes up short of expectations, no one will remember that Mira Murati built something real. They’ll call it a failure because it wasn’t worth $100B. When Harvey can’t grow into an $8B valuation fast enough, no one will remember they serve half of the top law firms in America. They’ll say legal AI was overhyped. That’s how hubristic fundraising works. The mercenaries don’t remember the mission. They only remember the paper. For many founders, especially in AI, hubristic fundraising isn’t really a choice. It’s a survival imperative at the very top. The war for AI talent is unlike anything we’ve seen before. Meta is offering $1 billion+ packages to poach researchers. OpenAI is clawing back co-founders from startups that raised $2 billion seed rounds. Google paid $2.4 billion just to acqui-hire 40 people from Windsurf. If you’re an AI founder and you don’t raise at an aggressive valuation, what happens? Your competitor raises at $10B. They can now offer engineers equity packages worth $50M on paper. Your $2B valuation offers $10M packages. You lose the talent war before it starts. Your competitor has $500M in the bank to buy GPUs. You have $50M. You can’t train competitive models. You fall behind on capabilities. Your competitor’s valuation signals “winner” to enterprise customers. Your valuation signals “risky bet.” You lose deals to perception, not product. In many cases, it might be almost irresponsible not to take the hubristic path. The founders who stayed disciplined, who raised at “reasonable” valuations, who prioritized sustainable growth—many of them got steamrolled by competitors who didn’t. So I’m not here to tell founders to avoid hubristic fundraising. In the current AI environment, that might be asking them to bring a knife to a gunfight. Hubristic fundraising narrows your exit options. Not always financially—Brex proved you can still do a “down exit” and create real liquidity. But it narrows what success means for your stakeholders, your employees, your company narrative, and frankly, for your own psychology. When you raise at $12B, a $5B exit isn’t a win. It’s a disappointment. When you raise at $29B, anything less than a $50B+ IPO feels like failure. When your employees joined expecting a $100B outcome, a $10B exit means they’re doing mental math on what could have been. The mercenaries don’t just leave when things go badly. They leave when things go less well than the paper said they would. You can raise hubristically and still build a great company. Brex did. But you need to go in with eyes open about who you’re attracting, what expectations you’re setting, and how the narrative will be written if you come up even a little short. Because the siren call is seductive. The capital, the talent, the press, the gravity—it all feels like winning. And sometimes it is winning. But sometimes it’s just setting yourself up for a “failure” that would have been a triumph at any other valuation. Pedro Franceschi and Henrique Dubugras built something real. They went from Stanford dropouts to a $5B+ exit in under 8 years. They served thousands of companies, moved billions of dollars, and built technology that Capital One clearly values. The “failure” narrative says more about our broken expectations than about Brex. But there is a lesson here for founders considering hubristic fundraising—especially the AI founders raising at $10B, $20B, $50B valuations right now: Know who you’re attracting. The capital, talent, and attention that comes with a huge valuation comes with strings attached. Those strings are expectations. And when expectations get too disconnected from reality, you’ll eventually find yourself surrounded by people who were only ever there for the paper. Missionaries stay through the turnaround. Mercenaries don’t. Brex survived their turnaround and found a soft landing. Many companies in the next few years won’t be so fortunate. The question for every founder raising in this frothy AI market—whether you’re building fintech or AI B2B or foundation models—is simple: are you building a company or a casino bet? Are you really, honestly building a $100B generational company? And who exactly is sitting at your table? Because when the cards turn—and they always turn—you’ll find out fast who was really on your team. Just ask Brex. They built a real company, executed a real turnaround, and achieved a real exit. And half the internet is calling it a failure because the number wasn’t big enough. That’s the price of hubristic fundraising. Powerful? Yes. Dangerous? Also yes. Choose your investors, your employees, and your expectations wisely. The mercenaries won’t be there when you need them most.

Title: The AI Energy Supercycle: Striving to Secure 24/7 Power Infrastructure

January 23, 2026 13:35 ET | Source: Equity Insider Equity Insider VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Jan. 23, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Equity-Insider.com News Commentary – The global push for Artificial Intelligence is colliding with a considerable physical bottleneck: the power grid is struggling to keep up with data centers' explosive demand[1]. As facilities transform from passive consumers into active energy partners, the market appears to be shifting focus toward assets that can deliver reliable, around-the-clock baseload power. With the U.S. government committing billions to revive domestic uranium enrichment to fuel both current reactors and next-generation modular systems[2], the industry is seeing an unusual wave of activity as institutional capital is beginning to flow toward the companies anchoring this new energy foundation, including Spring Valley Acquisition Corp. II (OTC: SVIIF), Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META), NANO Nuclear Energy (NASDAQ: NNE), and Ucore Rare Metals (TSXV: UCU) (OTCQX: UURAF). While renewable energy capacity continues to expand globally, the intermittent nature of wind and solar means they currently have trouble powering the high-performance AI superclusters that require constant, firm energy. This reality has turned energy security into a strategic mandate, with new policy frameworks appearing to treat the nuclear fuel supply chain as vital national infrastructure rather than just another commodity. Consequently, the industry seems to be entering a systemic re-rating phase as the Western world races to secure the physical assets required to help power a digital-first economy. Spring Valley Acquisition Corp. II (OTC: SVIIF), a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) recently announced a pending merger with uranium miner Eagle Energy Metals, a next-generation nuclear energy company with the largest mineable, measured and indicted U.S. uranium deposit. Following the announcement, Eagle Energy Metals announced that it has engaged BBA USA Inc., a consulting firm with over 45 years of energy sector experience, to design a targeted drilling campaign at its Aurora Uranium Project in support of an eventual Pre-Feasibility Study. The timing matters because following the SPAC merger, the company is heading toward a NASDAQ listing, subject to customary closing conditions, under the ticker symbol NUCL. Notably, the team orchestrating this transaction is the same SPAC team that brought NuScale Power Corporation (NYSE: SMR) public in 2022. Eagle Energy Metals holds rights to what it describes as the largest open pit-constrained, measured and indicated uranium deposit in the United States. The Aurora deposit sits on the Oregon-Nevada border with 32.75 million pounds of indicated uranium and 4.98 million pounds inferred, based on over 500 drill holes. Adjacent to Aurora is the Cordex deposit, which has seen over 100 holes drilled and offers potential resource expansion as the company digitizes existing data. "We're seeing sustained demand for nuclear power translate into real demand for uranium, particularly for projects located in the U.S.," said Mark Mukhija, CEO of Eagle Energy Metals. "Advancing Aurora with BBA is about making sure this asset is ready to meet that demand as the market continues to tighten." The domestic supply situation provides context for the company's positioning. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, in 2023, U.S. utilities purchased more than 50 million pounds of uranium, with less than 5% obtained from limited domestic production and over 95% sourced from abroad, including significant amounts from Russia and Kazakhstan. President Trump recently signed four executive orders aimed at removing regulatory barriers and seeking to quadruple U.S. nuclear power over the next 25 years, while invoking the Defense Production Act to secure domestic uranium supply. Meanwhile, electricity demand is accelerating as AI, quantum computing, and cryptocurrency operations strain global grids. Meta recently announced plans to build a $10 billion AI data center in Louisiana powered by nuclear energy from Constellation Energy, while Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle, and Nvidia have struck major deals to power their operations with nuclear. Beyond uranium, Eagle Energy Metals also holds rights to exclusive Small Modular Reactor (SMR) technology. With BBA's technical continuity (they authored Aurora's SK-1300 Technical Report Summary in August 2025), existing infrastructure, and access to low-cost hydropower in a mining-friendly jurisdiction, the company is advancing its asset as domestic uranium supply becomes increasingly prioritized. Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META) have announced an agreement supporting development of a 1.2 GW nuclear power campus in Pike County, Ohio, to supply clean energy for Meta's regional data centers including its AI supercluster in New Albany. The agreement provides a mechanism for Meta to prepay for power and fund project advancement for Oklo's Aurora powerhouse deployment on 206 acres of land formerly owned by the U.S. Department of Energy. "Two years ago, Oklo shared its vision to build a new generation of advanced reactors in Ohio. Today, that vision is becoming a reality," said Jacob DeWitte, CEO of Oklo. "Meta's funding commitment in support of early procurement and development activity is a major step in moving advanced nuclear forward." According to the company, pre-construction and site characterization are slated to begin in 2026, with the first phase targeted to come online as early as 2030. "Our agreement with Oklo enables the development of 1.2 gigawatts of nuclear energy in Southern Ohio, supporting Meta's operations in the region—including our AI supercluster in New Albany," said Urvi Parekh, head of global energy at Meta Platforms. "By investing in baseload nuclear energy, we're helping build a resilient and sustainable future for our communities." The scalable powerhouse facility plans to expand incrementally to deliver the full 1.2 GW target by 2034, creating thousands of construction and long-term operations jobs. NANO Nuclear Energy (NASDAQ: NNE) announced that it has signed a memorandum of understanding with Ameresco to explore deploying its advanced modular microreactor technologies on federal and commercial sites across the United States. The collaboration will evaluate potential pathways for siting, development, construction, licensing, operation, and eventual decommissioning of NANO Nuclear's nuclear modular microreactors including KRONOS MMR, ZEUS and LOKI MMR systems. "This MOU marks another milestone for NANO Nuclear as we continue to build customer demand for our approach to delivering reliable, modular nuclear microreactor energy systems in support of the United States' energy transition," said Jay Yu, Founder and Chairman of NANO Nuclear. "Working alongside Ameresco, a leading U.S. publicly traded energy infrastructure company, gives us the opportunity to test our advanced, patented microreactor technologies against real-world requirements at scale, across both federal and commercial levels." Following comprehensive assessment of regulatory and financial considerations, stakeholder engagement, site suitability and utility interconnections, Ameresco and NANO Nuclear expect to enter specific agreements under which Ameresco would lead engineering, procurement and construction activities for sites using NANO Nuclear's systems. The companies plan to coordinate on government funding and available incentives as the initial assessment advances. Ucore Rare Metals (TSXV: UCU) (OTCQX: UURAF) announced updates on advancements for its RapidSX™ rare earth element separation technology commercialization and its USD$22.4 million U.S. Department of War Other Transaction Agreement through the U.S. Army Contracting Command-Orlando. Ucore reported that, since December 2023, it has completed approximately 5,700 hours of REE processing with tonnes of heavy mixed rare earth oxides in an automated 24-hour per day commercial production environment at its Kingston, Ontario Commercialization and Demonstration Facility, dedicated to transitioning the RapidSX™ technology to its under-construction Louisiana Strategic Metals Complex in Alexandria. "The nearly two years of CDF demonstration work undertaken by Ucore has been done with deliberate coordination with the Louisiana SMC production roll-out pathway," said Mike Schrider, P.E., VP and COO of Ucore. "The result is a technically proven and de-risked commercialization pathway to commence heavy rare earth processing in Louisiana in 2026." The company has produced multiple rare earth element groups and products including TbDy, Tb, and Dy, demonstrating 2 to 4 times faster throughput over conventional solvent extraction methods. Full commercial-scale Louisiana SMC work is underway for the installation of RapidSX™ Machine #1 in mid-2026.

Title: BitGo kicks off what could be a huge year for IPOs
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/23/bitgo-kicks-off-huge-year-ipos/
Time Published: 2026-01-23T14:20:26Z

UPDATED 09:20 EST / JANUARY 23 2026 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof In the first big initial public offering of 2026, the crypto platform BitGo shot out of the gate fast as initial trading jumped 25% over the offering price. Investors took a deep breath later, but the stock still rose almost 3% on the day — which means it raised about as much as it could. John Furrier covered it like a glove from the NYSE floor, including many interviews with BitGo and its partners. More IPOs could be coming too, not just from crypto companies such as Kraken and Ledger, but from artificial intelligence bellwethers such as Anthropic and OpenAI, Elon Musk’s Starlink and (maybe!) data giant Databricks. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang thinks that not only is there no bubble in artificial intelligence, but we actually need even more investment. 👀 Well, at least for now, most people agree, in particular investors who continue to plough plenty of dough into both AI chipmakers such as Furiosa AI, Upscale AI and AheadComputing, and all the AI companies that will need them, such as Anthropic, Humans&, China’s Moonshot AI, inference startup Baseten, Databricks and more. No slowdown in 2026, that’s for sure. If you want to know what’s coming in data and AI this year, don’t miss the latest Breaking Analysis from Dave Vellante and his panel of data experts. There’s a whole lot here, but one takeaway is that the agentic AI era will make data all the more important — in particular contextual data, meaning intelligence — and the cost of not doing it right will be steep. Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin is looking to take on Elon Musk’s Starlink with an enterprise-focused ultra-fast satellite internet play called TeraWave. Competition is good. After watching its stock keep rising for much of the past year thanks to AI infrastructure demand and government help, Intel stumbled a bit with its latest earnings — in particular its guidance, which came in light. Next week brings some big earnings reports: Microsoft, IBM, Apple, Meta, Samsung, SAP, ServiceNow, ASML, Tesla and more. Here’s all the enterprise and emerging tech news this week from SiliconANGLE, theCUBE Research and beyond: 2026 data predictions: Scaling AI agents via contextual intelligence Nvidia CEO says AI needs more investment in defiance of bubble fears (per WSJ) OK, Jensen… but it’s pretty apparent this is some kind of a bubble, which means winners and losers. Anthropic boss Dario Amodei slams Trump over ‘crazy’ decision to sell advanced AI chips to China CEOs say AI is making work more efficient. Employees tell a different story (per Wall Street Journal) Palantir CEO says AI will eliminate the need for mass immigration Some of these tech titans are just kind of weird, or maybe just opportunistic.

Title: What Is A Treasury Bond? Are They Going Tits-Up? Did Trump Chicken Out?

That President Donald J. Trump! In case you missed it, all weekend and as he was taking off for the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday, he grunted and growled and pounded on his dumb web site about how he HAAAD TO HAVE GREENLAND, Denmark can’t protect it, how and why is it even theirs, he was going to tariff EU countries 10 percent and then 25 percent until they made Denmark give him Greenland, and tariff French wines 200 percent because President Macron refused to pay a billion-dollar bribe to be in Trump’s made-up peace club with Vlad Putin, Viktor Orban, and a pet psychic from Argentina. Whine, whine, whine!! Then while Trump was in the air, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was already in Switzerland, the US stock markets started going tits up, which is to say down, and then the Danish pension fund AkademikerPension confirmed that it would sell $100 million of US Treasury bonds out of concern over instability in the US. “It is not directly related to the ongoing rift between the [US] and Europe, but of course that didn’t make it more difficult to take the decision,” said Anders Schelde, the head investor, meaning that Trump’s hostile groanings and nonstop nonsensical threats made it pretty fucking easy, not to mention how the value of the dollar has been steadily plummeting since Trump took office. Poor Scott, what if the bond selloff snowballed like an Aspen orgy! Subscribe! Was Bessent’s spray-painted rubber muppet head ever in a tight spot then. He had to use his greasiest weasel words to explain to dumb reporters that once again Trump was full of shit about taking over Greenland and the threat of tariffs was just him trying to make some kind of meta-point, or something, and so everybody should just chill out, man. What BOND SELLOFF? “Denmark is irrelevant.” That smug little troll had to say some pointlessly dickish thing so all angry daddy would hear is how he really stuck it to that MEAN Denmark and all those UNFAIR JERKS at the lying Financial Times who LIED about the large asset managers they quoted who were considering dumping investments in the US from their portfolios. “I just think everyone needs to take a deep breath, do not listen to the media, who are hysterical, just like they were, just like you all were on April 2, and what happened, we had the best stock market recovery in history.” Ooh, he is so mad at those mean economists! Funds sell their bond holdings all the time, it’s no big deal. And he advised reporters on the sidelines, “It’s been 48 hours. As I said, sit back, relax.” Relax! Trump is, of course, the only person in the room who flies into a blind, seething rage whenever he gets told “no” about anything, and constantly says things that he does not mean, because he either knows they are lies at the time or is so batshit crazy he himself can’t tell the difference any more, and we all know there are never any consequences ever. So just chill out, guys! So much for Trump doing the tariffs because they’ll be so great for the American economy that every Cletus with a GED will be able to use AI to supervise robots building robots in the robot factory. Talk about the bond market got Bessent spooked because bond yields are the price of the debt on America’s giant credit card. US Treasury bonds and shorter-term products, T-bills and Notes, have always been considered the standard of stable kinds of investments. A bond is a bet that in 10, 20, or 30 years, the US Treasury will still exist and be able to repay with a modest but stable interest. Bonds are a perfect investment for big savings and retirement funds, and domestic funds and banks hold about 70 percent of them. Then around 30 percent of US bonds are held by foreign governments, mostly Japan, the UK, and China. Which just fell to third place; they’d already been slowly selling off their holdings. So if the US Treasury yields go up, and bond prices go down, it means fewer investors betting on the US, and more of a risk of those bonds not paying off is priced in. With the Supreme Court possibly on the verge of letting Trump fire Lisa Cook and Jerome Powell on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (but probably not; the Federal Reserve is a “special case” because the Supreme Court Six likes its money) and effectively giving himself the power to set interest rates, or convert the Treasury’s holdings into Melania NFTs if he wants, you can see where long-term investors might be coming from with that worry. Sure, the Danish pension fund’s $100 million is a rounding error compared with America’s $30 trillion of debt. But investors, especially institutional ones, by definition hate uncertainty and are easily influenced by others, and a trickle and then stampede of investors selling their T-Bonds for Chinese bonds or mutual funds in Deutschemarks or Loonies could trigger a disaster. No wonder Bessent was all a-twitter to dismiss STUPID DENMARK THAT NOBODY CARES ABOUT. And so what do you know, Trump immediately backed down from the tariffs and sending US troops to mount a coup in Nuuk and start a war with NATO, saying that he would settle for “frameworks of a future deal” of some kind. And the US stock markets recovered. For now, anyway. They’ve been riding higher on demand for AI technology, infrastructure and chips and such, but according to a study from MIT, 95 percent of businesses have seen zero return on any of their investments in AI technology yet. It seems the only jobs AI robots have actually taken so far are “student who was supposed to write their own term paper,” “lawyer who was supposed to write their own briefs,” and “Adobe Photoshop child-undresser.” Up and up and up the markets now go! When will they crash, nobody really knows. [Wall Street Journal gift link / CNBC / Financial Times archive link] Share! Share Here is where you donate to keep Wonkette going forever!
