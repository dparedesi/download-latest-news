Incoming WPP CEO Cindy Rose has a big job ahead when she steps into the role in September. As the Microsoft exec takes the reins from Mark Read, who’s departing after seven years at the helm, she inherits a business in decline that’s struggling to keep pace with an industry in flux. In addition to addressing WPP’s structural and financial problems—it issued a shock profit warning and downgraded its 2025 growth forecast last week—Rose must stave off continued client losses and turn around morale at its agencies. Industry leaders agree that Rose has the AI and technology expertise needed to bring WPP into the future. But what’s most crucial is that she develops a clear vision for a business that’s lacked one for some time. “Hopefully the WPP board are clear about what its new strategy is, as the current one has not delivered,” said Ajaz Ahmed, founder of Studio.One and former CEO of WPP agency AKQA. As the leader of a public company, Rose will have to contend with shareholders impatient for WPP’s stock to bounce back from historic lows. This will be difficult in a sector that is “facing real pressure,” said Ahmed. “Interest rates are still high. Budgets are tight. Platforms like Meta, TikTok, and Google offer increasingly sophisticated ad tools that bypass agencies,” he said. “Consulting firms and independent agencies are winning share with a more attractive value proposition.” In that pressure cooker, Rose’s strategic decisions will, in large part, be dictated by the board’s end game: Does it want to create a real strategy for WPP’s future, or would it be better off selling the company for parts? “There’s the financial engineering side—what will produce the most value for shareholders independent of the right strategy?” said Brian Wieser, principal at Madison and Wall. “Because the stock is so, so very low, it could very well be that the board would rather see some immediate benefits.” Martin Sorrell, CEO of S4 Capital and former CEO of WPP for three decades, said it comes down to whether the business “would be better off being dismembered into its still standing constituent parts or consolidated elsewhere.” “Companies that were once part of WPP, such as Kantar, VCCP, FGS, and Globant have thrived as independent companies,” Ahmed pointed out. “The question is, could WPP realize the value in some of its assets before it’s too late, or does it want to merge and consolidate its agencies further internally?” If the board does want to pursue a future for WPP in this current state, Rose needs a clear strategy and point of view for the business—something observers agree has been lacking. “The big concern for shareholders and employees isn’t just the structure; it’s the absence of a clear, credible plan,” Ahmed said. “For a while now, it’s felt like WPP has been making it up as it goes along.” For Wieser, that challenge gets to the heart of an existential industry issue: “how do you organize a modern agency group, and what should the agency services industry look like?” While Read merged agencies under WPP to streamline its unwieldy operations, he hasn’t gone as far as his peers in operating the company as a single brand. Instead, he’s touted the importance of agency brands as levers for attracting clients and talent, Wieser said. But that approach has drawbacks for WPP, including adding “layers of non-billable overhead both at the central level and within the agencies,” as well as “tremendous duplication of services,” Ahmed said. “Ogilvy has become a holding company within a holding company, which isn’t exactly simplification.” Wieser agreed that agency mergers weren’t a real strategy. “That was desperation,” he said. “There’s a recognition these will be loss-making entities on their own, so let’s do the bare minimum.” Coming in as an industry outsider, Rose will have to quickly develop a point of view on the role of agency brands and identify the right structure to take WPP into the future. “Being both a holding company and a client-facing brand at the same time as managing dozens of agency brands with their individual cultures, leadership teams, and operations is confusing, and this model hasn’t worked for WPP,” Ahmed said. Under Read, WPP invested millions of dollars into WPP Open, its internal AI platform. It will be Rose’s job to make that bet pay off—and set WPP up for an AI-powered future. “The significant investment into WPP Open hasn’t yielded the growth that was hyped a couple of years ago,” Ahmed said. According to Jay Pattisall, principal analyst at Forrester, WPP chose a tech executive with an AI background for exactly that reason: “The selection of Rose is designed, in part, to further commercialize WPP Open,” he said. Ahmed agreed that Rose’s experience at Microsoft, which “hasn’t exactly been shy about reinventing themselves over the years,” will be useful in pushing WPP to adapt to automation. But whether that’s enough to transform the legacy holding company’s business model remains to be seen. “WPP is a services company, not a software company,” Pattisall agreed. “Modernizing WPP itself, as it reconciles with automation and change, will be no small task.” “I’m not convinced that agencies can build a SaaS-type business in competition with software companies like Adobe,” Sorrell added. Rose is taking over a business where morale is low and client relationships are tenuous. WPP has lost several major clients this year, including Mars and Coca-Cola. Meanwhile, ongoing layoffs and a botched return-to-work mandate have led to discontent and anxiety among staff. Sorrell pointed to what he views as a misguided simplification strategy under Read, which collapsed brands like J. Walter Thompson, Young & Rubicam, and Wunderman, as the reason WPP has lost “not only many talented leaders, but clients as a result too.” Nick Emery, CEO of agency Jellyfish and a former WPP Media exec, believes Rose’s biggest challenge will be to “fight for, protect, and champion the many brilliant people who’ve given their all to the company—and to craft a strategy that makes them happier, drives growth for clients, and fully embraces the role of AI to fulfill the promise of technology.” Rose’s attention here must be “24/7, laser-focused on the USA,” according to Sorrell, which is “undoubtedly the center of the client world and where WPP people are probably most demoralized.” “You have to hope—if you’re hoping for good things for WPP—that she’s an excellent manager,” Wieser added. “That’s probably the single most important issue.” Rose’s industry outsider status could be a challenge or benefit, depending who you ask. Ahmed described her as “a safe pair of hands” as “an internal candidate with an external vantage point.” Sorrell said she fits WPP board chairman Philip Jansen’s criteria as a technology and AI-forward executive. But Wieser pointed out that in addition to this being her first CEO gig, her only ad industry experience has been through the vantage point of sitting on WPP’s board. “You really haven’t actually lived and breathed the industry,” he said of Rose. “It’s plausible that your views on the industry might be incomplete.” However, he added, “it can also mean fresh eyes, which is not a bad thing at all,” pointing to Michael Roth’s successful tenure at IPG. What’s crucial is that Rose surrounds herself with executives that have “clarity of vision.” “It’s going to come down to good management,” he said.

Title: Nvidia dethrones Apple as king of market milestones
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/your-money/2025/07/14/nvidia-dethrones-apple-as-king-of-market-milestones/
Time Published: 2025-07-14T04:02:00Z
Full Content:
Nvidia is the world’s first $4 trillion company, leaving Apple – long the king of market milestones – in its wake. Apple was the first to hit $1 trillion, $2 trillion and $3 trillion. But while its market capitalisation ($3.15 trillion) has idled since first closing above that landmark in mid-2023, Nvidia’s has quadrupled, fuelled by insatiable demand for its AI chips. Even that understates Nvidia’s rise: the stock is up more than 1,000 per cent since early 2023. [ Nvidia outpaces Microsoft and Apple on path to $4 trillion valuationOpens in new window ] That sounds bubbly, but staggering revenue growth suggests otherwise. Revenues rose 69 per cent last quarter to $44 billion, with another record forecast for this one. Its top customers – Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Alphabet – are to spend $350 billion on capital expenditure this year, much of it on Nvidia hardware. Valuation remains punchy, but not absurd. Nvidia’s price-sales ratio is nearly four times that of Apple’s, but the difference between their forward price-earnings ratios is slight. Nvidia bulls will note its growth rate is exponentially higher than Apple’s and its PEG ratio (which adjusts for earnings growth) is actually far lower. Apple is stable and cash-rich, but slow growth means it’s far from cheap. Nvidia appears riskier, but it keeps growing into its multiple. For now at least, investors are willing to pay up for speed over stability.

Title: Strap In, Vision Pro Owners
URL: https://spiral.spyglass.org/p/strap-in-vision-pro-owners
Time Published: 2025-07-13T18:05:15Z
Full Content:
Apple is apparently gearing up to launch an updated Vision Pro later this year, per Mark Gurman of Bloomberg. The big upgrade? Not the new chip, which will only be mildly useful without much content that can actually push the device, but instead a new head strap. I'm not kidding. They better be selling this thing separately for current Vision Pro owners and not forcing people to buy a new $3,500 paperweight or there will be riots in the streets. Well, amongst the few dozen Vision Pro owners in any given area. I kid, but I don't. Clearly such an update would simply be a message to the market that Apple isn't abandoning their plans in the face of slow sales and developer adoption. They're not ready to unveil a real upgrade yet – that will come in 2027 – but the spec bump and head strap is throwing the proverbial bone out there. Obviously – obviously – the first Vision Pro should have been released as a dev kit as I wrote 15 months ago. I know it would not have been very Apple-like to do that, but Apple needs to start doing some un-Apple-like things, IMO. They could have leaned on the messaging that this future piece of technology wasn't quite ready for prime time, but developers could get a glimpse of the future today if they're willing to pony up. And if a consumer really wants to try it, well, sign up for a developer account and have at it. That would have flipped the narrative entirely here. And honestly, I'm not sure the messaging would have been that much different from the way Steve Jobs used to call Apple TV a "hobby". All this new strap will do is further showcase how badly Apple messed up the ergonomics here. The fact that the Vision Pro shipped with two straps in the box already said all you needed to know. Now we'll apparently have a third option – after Apple implicitly endorsed other third-party options as well. The entire package is entirely too inconvenient for most people to even consider using on a regular basis. This better be one hell of a strap. This article is sort of framed oddly, suggesting that Amazon is "weighing another multibillion-dollar investment in Anthropic" when actually, we know from a 10-Q filing that they're due to invest "an additional $2.7 billion by Q4 2025". So I'm not sure what they're "weighing" here as this money was already committed in the form of convertible notes in different tranches. I suppose it's possible that they could have already invested the $2.7B between that filing (in May, for the quarter ended March) and now, but it's highly unlikely. So perhaps they're thinking about investing more on top of that commitment? Or maybe lines were just crossed and this reporting on that (already known) commitment. Regardless, one tidbit here is that the tech giants are capped "to keep them well below owning more than a third of Anthropic". Google currently owns 14% and my backtracking math has Amazon currently at 22.4% (before any new investment), so both have some room to grow if they want to put more money in (and undoubtedly insane valuations which will make growing their ownership stakes much from here difficult). One more wildcard: what if Apple were to invest? They pulled back from the OpenAI deal last year, but if they're really considering Claude as a Siri replacement/supplement... [FT 🔒] I was back on Alex Kantrowitz's Big Technology Podcast to talk about all of this and more. And notably, we talk through the Apple/Claude potential partnership for Siri and yes, if it could portend an Apple investment into Anthropic... the startup is undoubtedly too expensive for Apple to buy at this point – nor would Amazon (or Google) want/allow that, but Anthropic needs money. Apple has money. Sidenote: I'll be back on Big Technology Podcast on a monthly cadence going forward. You can find it on Spotify here or Apple Podcasts here. [YouTube] Look, Dune Messiah would have been a cooler name but it also perhaps signals Denis Villeneuve's intent not to stick to that particular book and to go beyond it. At the same time, he talks about how he doesn't view this as a trilogy because he considers the first two to really be one film – so it's weird to call this one "Part Three", unless you consider this to also be a part of one (now really) long film? At least no one is going to be confused like they may have been with another Anya Taylor-Joy movie, Furiosa ("A Mad Max Saga"). Also, note the fact that it won't be shot entirely with IMAX cameras (like Christopher Nolan's The Odyssey will for the first time in a feature film) but clearly a lot of it will be. By the time he's filming his Bond, might he be ready to go all-in on IMAX? (Probably not – but again, certainly a good chunk of it!) [Variety] Mark Gurman and Riley Griffin were able to pull a few more details about the package it took to lure Ruoming Pang from Apple to Meta. "More than $200M" over a few years, largely in stock tied to performance of Meta's own stock (and probably some other metrics). But yes, there are likely large "signing bonuses" involved in these deals depending on how much equity the talent would be walking away from. In Pang's case, that's obviously just Apple RSUs and not startup equity, but you can see how such cash payouts can rise quickly. It all sounds in the range of a 'Godfather' offer. "Apple didn’t try to match the offer..." Yeah I mean the only question is if their counter would have been off by two or three orders of magnitude. [Bloomberg 🔒] When the author wrote about the two companies racing one another to hit the milestone, I doubt he thought that NVIDIA would cross it in less than a week. Such is the state of AI exuberance. And while Microsoft has clearly ridden the wave as well – to the tune of their highest P/E ratio in 20 years – their risks and rewards are clearly less binary than they are with NVIDIA. They also have more levers to pull, which is what we may be seeing now with the layoffs even in a time of seeming strength as their revenue-per-employee is far below that of say, Google. Poor Apple, just literally not in this conversation right now. They very nearly hit $4T themselves last December, but now are nearly a full $1T behind their old friend/foe NVIDIA and a good $600B behind their old foe/foe Microsoft. The first company to hit $1T and $2T and $3T will likely be the 3rd to hit $4T – if they do at all (come on, they will, but it's rough out there right now!). All that said, if the AI market falters, NVIDIA and Microsoft are falling, fast. While Apple will likely be sitting pretty thanks to their inaction and ineptitude in AI. [WSJ 🔒] Right after Dia, Perplexity's Comet is here – with OpenAI inbound... To me, the biggest news about Linda Yaccarino stepping down as CEO of Xitter is that Xitter still had a CEO. I honestly thought that when they merged with xAI that whole charade sort of went away. Kudos on lasting two years, I guess. That is about double what anyone guessed. [Axios] Apparently and remarkably, this is unrelated to the latest Xitter xhitshow as she was telling people about her departure earlier in the week. [NYT] Might she land at Paramount post-Skydance merger when her old boss Jeff Shell takes over the President role?... [THR] OpenAI's first "open" model (weights, not source) could be here as soon as next week. And yes, it may add even more pressure to the Microsoft relationship – will it be on every cloud soon? [Verge] As expected, Mistral is in talks to raise up to $1B, likely from MGX and others. Another deal that will make it harder for Apple to make a deal if they wanted to this path (if they even could)... [Bloomberg 🔒] While there's no word on Mistral's valuation, SpaceX seems poised to hit $400B, which would put them close to ByteDance (pre-TikTok sale) in terms of highest private valuation. Well ahead of OpenAI. For now. [FT 🔒] It's not just Meta that is poaching from OpenAI, OpenAI is also poaching from Meta – but really, mainly Elon companies with talent from Tesla and xAI. I'm sure OpenAI was devastated to have this news leak via internal Slack messages. [Wired] We're getting a live-action Hot Wheels movie, thus moving us one step closer to the prophecy of the Kool-Aid Man busting through a brick wall on the silver screen. [Variety] In other computing headwear news, Meta has formalized their investment in EssilorLuxottica – $3.5B into the publicly-traded firm for a stake just under 3%, which they hope to bring up to 5%. Most importantly, this seemingly formalizes the fact that Google/Samsung/Apple/Snap/etc won't be working with their brands on any competing products... [Bloomberg 🔒] 'Max' is now officially 'HBO Max' again with app icons being updated around the world. No need to download a new app this time (which was another amazing moment of stupidity in all this). And now the countdown is officially on until they're 'HBO' again. [Verge] "I would expect Grok to discover new technologies that are actually useful no later than next year, and maybe end of this year. It might discover new physics next year… Let that sink in." – Elon Musk, talking a big game (obviously as usual) with the release of Grok 4. Can xAI back up these claims better than Meta was able to back up Mark Zuckerberg's big claims about Llama 4? Or will Elon be next to step in with $500M pay packages and 'Godfather' offers? (The early results seem promising for Grok 4 – but they also did for Llama 4! You can try it out yourself for the low-low price of $300/month.) In July 2015, 10 years ago, NVIDIA's market cap was $10B. Yesterday, it hit $4T. No posts Ready for more?

Title: Algolia Tops Google In Product Search — Windsurf May Not Help Much

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Gartner rates privately-held Algolia ahead of Google in the $56 billion market for search and product discovery. With Alphabet stock down this year, investors should be worried. GERMANY - 2024/09/21: In this photo illustration, a mobile phone with the website of ai search ... More engine company Algolia Inc. is seen in front of business logo. (Photo Illustration by Timon Schneider/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) The market for digital commerce search reached $56.5 billion in 2024 and is forecast to grow at a 12.6% compound annual rate to $185.7 billion in 2033, reports Data Horizon Research. Algolia’s customer base has grown at a 21% average annual rate to 18,000, according to my July 10 interview with Algolia CEO Bernadette Nixon. Google — shares of which have lost 5% of their value in 2025 — is confident in the strength of its product discovery search service, according to a Google company release. Gartner rates privately-held San Francisco-based Algolia ahead of Google. Google’s spent $2.4 billion to license Windsurf AI coding technology, reported CNBC. That unlikely to be enough for Google to surpass Algolia — or faster-growing AI rivals such as ChatGPT and Perplexity. Google shares have lost value in 2025. That’s because the search giant — which developed the core Transformer model for predicting the next word based on its context underlying generative AI, according to my book, Brain Rush — is struggling to catch up with ChatGPT and others when it comes to commercializing its idea. Is the drop in Google stock a buying opportunity? The answer depends on whether Google can keep its search business relevant. “The market will need to see fundamental evidence that Google search is indeed going to be more durable than currently appreciated,” Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak wrote in a report featured by Investor’s Business Daily. If rivals such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Meta AI better deploy generative AI to cash in on advertising and improved e-commerce and travel verticals, Google’s stock could keep dropping, noted Nowak. For Google bulls, I have bad news: Algolia — which says it is deploying agentic AI for brands — is ahead of Google in those two search and product discovery verticals. In 2018, I was surprised to learn Google had abandoned the business of helping consumers search through a company's online product catalog, according to my October 2018 Forbes post. Google was good at bringing users to a website but once there, customers relied on the websites’ own search functions to find products. Some companies "build their own engines; others use open-source software, such as Elasticsearch,” the Economist reported. At the time, Algolia — founded in Paris in 2012 — was rapidly taking a piece of that pie by supplying a service that "hunts the client’s website and swiftly offers consumers relevant results," added the Economist. Since then, Google has entered this market and this year was deemed a leader in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for vision and ability to execute. However, within that elite group of leaders, Algolia is the top dog. Read on for why this market is significant and why I do not think Google is doing enough to overtake Algolia and larger rivals in monetizing AI. I requested comment from Google and will update this post if I receive a reply. While analysts use many ways to describe the digital commerce search industry, they agree the industry is growing fast and will become far larger in the next decade. The industry’s goal is to understand consumers’ needs and recommend products that best satisfy those needs. AI is the most significant growth propellent for this business in year — it enhances consumer experiences, increase sales, and boosts engagement, according to SuperAGI. AI-driven recommendation engines can increase customer loyalty, average order size and the lifetime value of a customer. For example, 71% of consumers are more likely to return to a website offering personalized experiences. Moreover, such systems suggest complementary products — thereby increasing average order value by 10% to 15%, reported SuperAGI. Algolia appears to be riding this growth wave. The company provides an AI-native search and discovery platform to enable brands such as PetSmart, Best Buy, Chewy, Twitch, Stripe, and Under Armour to deliver fast, relevant, and personalized search experiences, according to an Algolia release. Algolia’s search-as-a-service solution uses AI recommendations, NeuralSearch, and real-time personalization to boosts user engagement and increase conversion rates, the release added. Algolia has added many customers in the last five years. “When I joined Algolia we had less than 7,000 customers, now we have 18,000,” Nixon — who joined the company in 2020 — told me. “We process two billion transactions per year and have millions of developers on our platform.” Algolia’s growth can be attributed to its ability to satisfy e-commerce search customers’ need for reliable performance at scale. “We provide five nine’s reliability which means only 26 seconds of downtime per month,” she said. “Reliability is really important and it is difficult to do when operating at scale.” Algolia has repeatedly introduced meaningful innovations. “We disrupted the market three times and we are about to do it a fourth,” Nixon explained. Instead of relying on preexisting search software such as Lucene, Algolia’s search was built from scratch to work on mobile. Next, the company introduced search as a service and charged customers based on the number of searches — with the price per search declining with the number of searches. Finally, in 2023, Algolia introduced hybrid search — “combining keyword and natural language search incorporating large language models,” she told me. Algolia is most excited about agentic AI — which will enable consumers to take action towards a goal. The company uses Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol — which allows AI agents to access Algolia's search, analytics, recommendations, and index configuration APIs. “AI agents must be able to work across walled gardens to traverse a company’s back-end seamlessly to retrieve data,” she said. “To that end, we have partnered with Salesforce Commerce Cloud and Adobe Experience Manager.” Algolia’s customers are benefiting from how much consumers’ use of ChatGPT to search for products is adding to web traffic. “Adobe Analytics has found generative AI is giving retailers and banks 1,200% traffic increases while travel sites are seeing 1,700% increases,” she told me. “When people come to a retailer’s site they bounce 23% less frequently and look at 12% more pages per visit.” Algolia also provides personalized digital shopping guides — say, for Mother’s Day and Valentine’s Day — targeted towards various lifestyles. “In beta test, we have 73 shopping guides already,” she concluded. Google's offerings — notably Google Ads and Vertex AI Search for Commerce — can boost retailer revenues in three ways: In July 2025, Gartner ranked Google and Algolia as Magic Quadrant for Search and Product Discovery leaders based on their completeness of vision and ability to execute. Algolia is the leader among leaders — prevailing over Google. Algolia is proud of Gartner’s recognition. “This is the second year we have been a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Search and Product Discovery,” Nixon told me. “We are up and to the right in the leader box which makes us the best in the industry for completeness of vision and ability to execute. How? We want to make search easy for the masses. We wanted to be scalable in the enterprise. We solve the search puzzle for the masses.” Google was happy to be an MQ leader. “We believe this recognition affirms Google’s evolving commitment to delivering high ROI-generating product discovery, through the use of AI in relevance, ranking, and personalization,” noted Google Cloud AI Director, Product Management Sachin Padwal in a July 8 company release. Algolia is ahead of Google in applying agentic AI for search and product discovery. While Google has not yet launched such a service, on July 11 the search giant acquired executive talent and intellectual property from Windsurf — a leader in agentic AI, noted CNBC. Algolia’s MCP Server — launched in June 2025 — enables LLMs and autonomous agents to work together to help consumers buy what they need more quickly. For example, Algolia’s agentic AI service can help consumers book a Mediterranean cruise. By retrieving relevant consumer information from platforms such as Adobe and Salesforce. For example, Algolia agentic AI service can recommend and book a cruise based on each guest’s chosen destinations, travel history, and other preferences — in milliseconds, according to a company release. “This isn’t about showing off what agents could do,” Nixon said. “It’s about showing what they can do right now with a powerful user experience, if they have the right layer of intelligence underneath. That’s where Algolia fits.” Meanwhile, Google is currently experimenting with agentic AI for travel. Google’s “AI Mode” will be able to “plan full itineraries, remember context, and keep users within the AI interface — even for booking,” noted Hospitality.today. “Google’s Project Mariner” will enable “AI to take actions online -- like booking a hotel or tracking flight prices.” Google stock is 12% undervalued based on the average price target of 37 Wall Street analysts, according to TipRank. If Algolia’s lead over Google in search and product discovery is any indication, those analysts could be too optimistic.

Title: An Unsuspecting Contender - Rocky Mountain's Instinct Powerplay SL Long-Term Review
URL: https://www.vitalmtb.com/product/guide/e-bikes/rocky-mountain/instinct-powerplay-sl-67636
Time Published: 2025-07-12T14:05:13Z
Full Content:
Rocky Mountain probably isn't a brand many riders would expect to develop its own cutting-edge e-bike technology. But back in 2009, they did just that, launching Propulsion Powercycle under the same roof as their Quebec HQ. When they introduced their first model, the Altitude Powerplay, in 2017, the proprietary 108Nm Dyname 3.0 motor quietly took the top spot as the most powerful Class 1 E-bike motor. A title that was only recently relinquished to DJI's latest Avinox system. Seven years later, Rocky Mountain has once again pushed the limits of e-bikes with the 2025 Instinct Powerplay SL—their first delve into the lightweight e-bike category. The Powerplay SL offers 65Nm of torque and 550W of power, combined with a 480Wh battery, in a sub-45 lb package. Progressive suspension, adjustable geometry, and size-specific chainstays position the Instinct Powerplay SL as a capable all-rounder. Six months of testing later, let's get into how Rocky's first lightweight e-model performed and where it stands amongst the deep field of SL bikes. When Rocky Mountain unveiled the Dyname 4.0 motor on the Powerplay Lineup in 2021, there were no major performance gains over the then-four-year-old Dyname 3.0 system. Instead, Rocky focused on refining the system, packing it into a smaller space, reducing noise, and significantly cutting weight by over 15%, all while still delivering class-leading torque and power. This led some riders to wonder what it would look like if Rocky were ever to direct that effort at the SL e-bike category. Three years later, we have the answer. Rocky Mountain built on the lessons learned from the full-sized Dyname motors and synthesized them into the Dyname S4 Lite, a 65Nm, 550W motor that weighs only 5 lbs, available exclusively on the 145mm travel Instinct Powerplay SL. Coming in at only 43 lbs, the Instinct Powerplay SL fits comfortably into the SL e category, which seems to capture everything between 38 and 45 lbs, and does so with more battery and significantly more power than most other options. Size-specific chainstays and shock tunes, a reach-adjust headset, and adjustable geometry suggest that Rocky Mountain isn't just interested in mimicking the weight of a normal bike, but the ride experience as well. Like the rest of the Powerplay lineup, the Instinct SL uses a mid-pivot, four-bar suspension layout and a counter-rotating upper rocker link. Though Rocky has not published much about their kinematics, one can expect a good amount of leverage progression, somewhat neutral antirise, high antisquat, and a small amount of rearward wheel path. An integrated, removable battery surrounded by internal guide tubes for all cables and wires rounds out the basic features. The Instinct Powerplay SL is available in three full-carbon builds, ranging from $7,999 to $11,999, in addition to three aluminum builds priced from $5,499 to $7,999. We tested the Carbon 90 build, which came loaded with FOX Factory suspension, a full Race Face Era kit, handling wheels, bars, and cranks, SRAM Code Ultimate Stealth brakes, and an X0 Eagle Transmission drivetrain. Unlike most e-bikes, the Instinct Powerplay SL uses a BB92 pressfit bottom bracket and traditional cranks. Carbon and aluminum models share the same Dyname S4 Lite motor, integrated display, and geometry adjustments. The Dyname S4 Lite has five modes: Walk, Eco, Trail, Trail+, and Ludicrous. The motor can store three different power presets: Factory, Tune A, and Tune B. Tune A and B are adjustable with options to increase or decrease the assist for each mode, represented as a percentage. There is also a boost setting to configure how sensitive the motor is to rider inputs, which has five modes ranging from -2 (least sensitive, 'heavy workout') to +2 (most sensitive, 'low effort'). All motor configuration takes place on the display and with the mode selector switch. Personally, not having to download or open an app whenever I want to adjust the assist or see the odometer is a huge plus. You can even cycle through all three motor tunes and customize them without stopping. The Instinct SL features adjustable reach via included offset headset cups and adjustable head angle, bottom bracket height, and seat angle via the RIDE-4 chips in the upper shock link. Unlike its analog counterpart, the Instinct Powerplay SL does not feature an adjustable chainstay length. I did not make use of the +/-5mm adjustable reach, but as someone who grew up with chronic small bike syndrome, I appreciated having the option. RIDE-4 is a simplified version of Rocky's near-extinct RIDE-9 adjustment. It offers four geometry settings, taking the head angle from 63.5° to 64.2° and raising the bottom bracket about a centimeter. Four settings to change the head angle by 0.7 ° is excessive, but again, I appreciated having the option. I spent most of my time with the bike in position 3, the second highest/steepest. Allegedly, a mullet link will be available in the future and will be compatible with the SM-XL frames. Assembling the bike was straightforward and pain-free. Home mechanics that opt to have the bike delivered can expect to install the handlebar, front brake, front wheel, and battery, as well as run the cable, and cut the housing for the dropper post. The housing is already run through the frame, and the SRAM Transmission drivetrain is already paired and adjusted. All cables are internally routed with individual guide tubes that end at the base of the battery for easy access. Battery fitment is thoughtful, as it glides past the motor and is secured with two bolts. Aside from swapping out the 20mm rise Race Face Era Carbon handlebar for a more appropriate 40mm version, and eventually the EXO+ MaxxTerra Minion DHF for a DoubleDown MaxxGrip High Roller, the bike was left stock for the duration of the test. Motor Performance The Instinct SL was my first experience with Dyname's motor. Having spent extensive time on TQ's HPR50 and around Specialized's SL 1.2, the S4 Lite motor produced a noise level comparable to that of the HPR50. It does a good job of disappearing into the background with practically no whining or whirring. However, the S4 Lite has a persistent, unpleasant grinding that stems from the motor's integrated upper pulleys. Dyname's motors utilize two pulley wheels that sit above the chainring. One pulley serves as a traditional high-pivot idler, neutralizing chain forces from the suspension. The other monitors the tension between the chainring and pulley, telling the motor how much power to deliver. Both are protected by a small plastic cover that serves to keep out the elements and keep the chain secure on the idler. The pulleys are rough enough that the first ride around the neighborhood actually left a tingling sensation in my feet from the vibrations being transmitted through the pedals. They did wear in fairly quickly, to the point that I stopped noticing it after the first few rides. But the noise never went away and was audible to those around me when cruising on smooth pavement. When pedaling, the S4 Lite responds proportionately to rider input, all the way down to zero input. Unlike TQ's less powerful HPR50, where there seems to be a floor of minimum assistance, the S4 Lite has no such floor—give the motor very little and very little assistance you shall receive in return. This form of power delivery does come with a consequence: resting your foot on the pedal while stopped kills power to the motor and triggers an alert that the motor will eventually need to be recalibrated. Simply unweighting the pedal is enough to get the power back, and recalibration is a one button procedure handled through the onboard display, but that didn’t make it any less annoying. The S4 Lite also had an interesting flaw where the pulley noise and vibration would become increasingly worse as assist or RPM decreased. Pedaling at a low RPM with minimum assistance turned the grinding into an unpleasant clunking that was quite distracting. That quirk, alongside the fact that pedaling mountain bikes with your own legs is hard, discouraged me from dropping the assist below Trail+ (the third-highest assist level). The Instinct SL does have a relatively generous 480Wh battery, dwarfing the 360Wh and 320Wh batteries found on Trek's Fuel EXe and Specialized's SL models and just edging out the 430Wh battery found on Fazua's Ride 60 system. I never experienced any range anxiety. The 480Wh battery even allowed me to complete a 5,000 ft day without ever using Eco mode. The available Overtime 2.0 Range Extender can take the Instinct SL up to a massive 794Wh, which should cover the needs of 99.9% of riders. The Power offered by the motor is exceptional. With a peak power of 550W, the S4 Lite is within spitting distance of many current full-size e-bikes, including Shimano's EP801, which maxes out at 600W. I could join full-size e-bikes on trail climbs and keep up fairly well, though I would expect to get dropped on a sustained fire road climb. Climbing Performance Like most E-bikes ought to be, climbing the Instinct SL is nearly effortless. Its overall low weight, bolstered by EXO+ tires and the carbon Race Face Era wheels, made for a bike that gets up to speed quickly and has no problem maneuvering technical climbs. The 658mm top tube of the XL Instinct was plenty roomy for my 6'2" stature, though I would have happily traded a centimeter or two to bring the seat tube angle up to 79° from 77° as the front of the bike had a tendency to wander on steeper climbs. The rear shock did sink deeper into its travel than I would prefer on technical or rough climbs, leaving me vulnerable to pedal strikes. This occurred with 25% sag. The Float X shock does feature a climb switch, but I found it too firm to be all that useful on anything but roads. Closing the low-speed compression helped, but it made the shock spike on square-edge hits when descending. Ultimately, I ran the shock oversprung to help mitigate pedal strikes and dealt with the consequences otherwise. Descending As soon as I dropped into my first downhill aboard the Instinct SL, it was apparent just how long and balanced the geometry felt. Even when diving into steep corners, I found it easy to keep my weight over the front wheel while maintaining a neutral and upright body position. I had no trouble maneuvering the XL Instinct's 1306mm wheelbase around tight corners, either. The centered riding position made it effortless to unweight the rear wheel without getting the sensation of being in front of the front axle. I attribute this, in part, to the 450mm chainstays found on the L and XL. While 450mm is not huge, that number should start to approach 460mm at sag, thanks to the Instinct's mid-pivot design, contributing to a neutral body position. I would like to see larger jumps between sizes, a la Forbidden, but nonetheless, it beats the hell out of the 430mm chainstays found on most other XL SL e-bikes. The second thing I noticed was the unbalanced compression damping between the fork and shock. Even with Rocky Mountain's size-specific shock tunes, the fork had a noticeably more damped feel than the shock. On longer sections, I would feel my weight progressively shift backward after repeated compressions, requiring a conscious 'reset' to get back in the middle of the bike. I think this could be resolved with a firmer high-speed compression tune on the shock to better match the race feel of the Grip X2 36. I could probably get a more balanced feel by backing off the HSC on the fork, and putting in some volume spacers to maintain the bottom out resistance, but I think I'd be holding the bike back in terms of its descent capabilities. The only time I felt the bike took focus to ride was when resisting front wheel deflections. I found the Grip X2 Fox 36 to not track great over baby head rocks or angled square edge hits. I was able to mitigate this somewhat by replacing the EXO+ casing front tire with a heavier and softer DoubleDown, improving the material damping at the front of the bike.Still, the firm damping of the X2 that encouraged me to take the roughest of straight lines also demanded focus to not get caught out. At $12,000, one would expect the Instinct SL's parts spec not to leave one wanting, and that's mostly the case. The Race Face carbon wheels and cranks performed admirably without issue, the FOX Factory suspension was reliable, and I smashed the X0 Eagle derailleur so hard that I actually heard it move out of the way by like six gears, then reset back in place unaffected. Some riders may prefer heavier casing tires than the EXO+ featured across all build kits. I found them to be plenty durable for my needs, brushing off rock strikes and knife edges that would have ended an EXO casing tire's career. I'm less jazzed about the MaxxTerra compound used for both tires. It's passable for a rear tire but bordering on hazardous as a front tire. I would like to see a firmer tune on the rear shock as well as a rolling change to the new and improved FOX 36 to address the deflection issues I was having. The only component that degraded was the FOX Transfer post, which started getting sticky after just a few rides, struggling to reach full extension. Finally, I had no issues with the SRAM Codes that came on this bike, but in a world where Mavens exist, I'd like to see Mavens specced in the future. $12,000 is a lot of money to spend on a bike, yet somehow the C90 build that was tested is somewhere between average and above average value for the money. An equivalent build of Trek's Fuel EXe will set you back an additional $1,200. The $9,699 Carbon 70 build trades the Factory Grip X2 Suspension for Performance Elite Grip X, retains wireless shifting in the form of GX Transmission, downgrades to Code Silver brakes, and still comes in at a respectable 43.5 lbs. Of all of Rocky Mountain's offerings, the C70 is the one I would choose as a customer. At this price point, the equivalent Fuel EXe 9.8 T-Type comes spec'd with RockShox Select+ suspension and Code R brakes, which I feel is a real performance sacrifice. For me, the heart of the Powerplay SL is the low weight and high power, and while the C50 build does retain that at only 44 lbs, the RockShox Select Suspension, XT brakes, and Novatec wheels diminish the value of the low weight and power. Rocky Mountain does offer a range of aluminum builds, but I have a hard time rationalizing the build kits for anyone looking for solid downhill performance out of the box. The Alloy 70 BC Edition comes in at $8,000 fitted with Select+ suspension, Code Bronze brakes, GX Eagle Transmission, and a weight penalty to the tune of 48.5 lbs. For $200 less, a customer could roll away with a top of the line Commencal Meta Power SX 400 with Factory Grip X2 suspension, SRAM Code brakes, and a much less finicky Bosch SX motor, for practically the same weight. I spent several months on the Instinct SL and never had to tighten so much as a bolt or spoke. An included extra downtube guard should provide any necessary protection on shuttle days, and the motor showed no signs of degenerative wear, including the pulley wheels, despite creaking that suggested otherwise. The reach-adjust headset cup did produce some noise after a few rides. I was initially concerned when I pulled on the headset cup, and it came out by hand, but then I noticed the cup had an O-ring around it, meaning it was likely functioning as intended. I greased up the seal and the frame/cup interface and the noise went away. For a certain subset of riders, the pressfit BB92 bottom bracket will be a turn-off, but I have never had an issue with one. Given Rocky Mountain's financial situation, I would have concerns about being able to find service parts or fulfill a warranty if they were to shut their doors, however, the Instinct Powerplay SL gave no indication that the warranty would be needed. It's also worth mentioning that Dyname has recently updated their website, stating they are no longer exclusive to Rocky Mountain, and are looking for new partners, hinting at some continued motor support should Rocky Mountain close down. Despite the Dyname motor's rough-around-the-edges feeling, I had a blast riding the Instinct Powerplay SL. Progressive geometry, a ton of power, light overall weight, and solid range had me reaching for the bike as much as I could. Perhaps not quite a quiver killer, the Instinct SL held it down under a wide range of trails. It would not be my first choice if I were planning on spending a lot of time at bike parks, however, I'm confident it's up to the task. While I would struggle to encourage anyone to spend $12,000 on any bike, let alone one with the motor issues I encountered, the lower-priced builds can offer more value at a similar weight with specs that should cover most riders' needs, especially those less fussy about suspension performance. If you are searching for a lightweight eMTB that will let you nearly keep up with your friends on full-power bikes without compromising on geometry or riding experience, I would suggest being open to the Instinct Powerplay SL.

Title: Nvidia’s $4 Trillion Valuation Tells A Beautiful Retirement Story

ByJohn Tamny ByJohn Tamny, Contributor. SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 18: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers a keynote address during the ... More Nvidia GTC Artificial Intelligence Conference at SAP Center on March 18, 2024 in San Jose, California. The developer conference is expected to highlight new chip, software, and AI processor technology. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Nvidia’s valuation reached the $4 trillion mark this week, while co-founder Jensen Huang’s shares are now worth something like $143 billion. Present and future retirees should rejoice the rapidly increasing wealth inequality that Nvidia and Huang represent. That’s because inequality is the greatest gift to retirement of all. To see why, contemplate the “Magnificent Seven” stocks known to be the biggest drivers of the bull market of the present. Doing so requires a brief look backwards. If you purchased Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla and Nvidia early, you’re presently not worried about having enough money for retirement. Huang was of course at Nvidia in the beginning, and his enormous wealth exists as evidence of what can happen when early investors or employees stay the proverbial course amid immense share-price volatility. Twice in Nvidia’s public life its shares have dropped 90 percent on their way to gains greater than 300,000% to the present. That has been the norm among corporations that make up the Magnificent 7. Lots of ups and downs that the typical retail investor saving for retirement can’t endure. Which is the point. Thanks to index funds and ETFs that track the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, or for that matter global stock market indices, retirement savers don’t have to be early to transformative business concepts. Much more importantly, they don’t have to pick the shares that will eventually soar. Instead, they merely need to be invested. From there the stock market will not only do their worrying for them, their investment in broad indices ensures that they’ll have growing exposure to the very few corporations that unexpectedly emerge as the bluest of blue chips. That’s why present and future retirees should cheer rising inequality. Exactly because index funds and ETFs are frequently market-cap weighted, ownership of stock indexes evolves to reflect the most highly valued stocks most prominently. That’s where wealth inequality comes in. It’s an effect of entrepreneurs discovering a future of commerce that most never imagined. Since entrepreneurs are much earlier to world-changing and improving ideas than the markets themselves, they capture the majority of market gains from their discovery of what was only obvious after the fact. Still, would-be retirees once again don’t need to be early. They just need to be positioned for exposure to the high-flyers of today and tomorrow through broad market exposure. If so, as in if and when the next commercial visionary happens on a new idea that investors gradually fall in love with, the typical retirement investor stands to prosper substantially thanks to the genius of compounding. The good news is that the potential to compound one’s wealth grows by the day as the world shrinks by the day through commercial advances that reach greater and greater numbers of people. This is wealth inequality, and it’s transforming the quality of retirement for the much better.

Title: Google Search is under attack. Why ChatGPT won’t overthrow it yet.

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. While ChatGPT’s meteoric rise in popularity has positioned it to rival to traditional search engines, analysts say the chatbot hasn’t knocked Google out of the top spot just yet. Citi Research analysts led by Ronald Josey reiterated a Buy rating and $203 target price on shares of Alphabet, Google’s parent, on Friday. The stock was down slightly at $177.18 in morning trading. Citi polled 2,400 Google Search users in the U.S. and found that the search engine “remains core to most users’ Internet usage." The same conclusion held true across all age groups, Citi said. Still, the bank cited a rise in “alternative search experiences" among young users, naming ChatGPT and Meta Platforms’ Facebook and Instagram as examples. ChatGPT has become the “go-to" destination for younger users, with Google usage rising with age, Citi said. While 85% of respondents selected Google as their “core search engine," with 72% saying Google was their first site to search online, differences emerged among age groups. Among users aged 41 to 55, 88% of respondents named Google as their core search engine, but that number dipped to 83% for respondents aged 14 to 24. With that being said, the use of AI agents appears to be “more research-driven than commercial," as opposed to Google Search, where shopping was ranked as the top use case among respondents, Citi said. And the bank believes there’s more to love about Google’s growth story, as responses indicated that the use of other features such as Shopping and Travel continued to accelerate. Overall, the results suggest that Google Search is standing its ground for now, which is good news for Alphabet. Revenue attributed to Google Search and other services accounted for more than half of the total in the latest quarter. Google is set to report second-quarter results on July 23. Based on Citi’s preliminary analysis, “we believe the broader online advertising environment, including search and YouTube, is healthy," the analysts wrote. Other firms have sounded the alarm about AI and its effects on Google Search. However, Citi believes the search engine’s advertising market improved throughout the quarter. Earnings will put that theory to the test. Download the Mint app and read premium stories Log in to our website to save your bookmarks. It'll just take a moment.

Title: Opinion: Talking Point This Week: Trade Tensions, Tariff Jitters Dictate Newsflow
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/opinion/trade-tensions-donald-tariff-jitters-q1-earnings-talking-point-this-week
Time Published: 2025-07-11T18:31:43Z

This week was marked by trade tensions and tariff newsflow, with barbs being exchanged between the US and Brazil. Dollar was steady, but Bitcoin surged to levels not seen before. There were other news, including results flow in India as well as corporate developments. In corporate news, Delta Air Lines soared on strong quarterly results and a raised outlook, while WK Kellogg's shares jumped on reports of a $3 billion acquisition by Ferrero Group. Meanwhile, the EU is urgently seeking a trade deal with the US to avert further tariffs, and the UAE was formally removed from the EU's high-risk list for money laundering. Here are the key talking points this week: Trade Tensions The Biggest Event Global trade tensions just got a whole lot worse! The US is leading the charge with a slew of new tariff announcements that are sparking outrage worldwide. Canada's getting slammed with a 35% tariff on a bunch of imports, effective Aug. 1, because the US claims they're not doing enough to stop fentanyl trafficking. And that's not all - over 20 other countries are in the crosshairs, with tariffs ranging from 15% to 20%. Brazil's getting hit with a whopping 50% tariff, and copper imports are facing a 50% tariff. The US is also threatening a 200% tariff on pharma imports if companies don't move production to the US. This is all about "reciprocal tariffs," but it feels like a full-on trade war. Affected countries are already vowing to fight back and protect their workers, naturally so. Expert Opinion S Naren's insight that "every stock is discovered" reflects India's maturing stock market, where intense competition among brilliant stock pickers has left few undervalued opportunities, pushing investors toward contrarian picks in hated sectors like oil and gas, supported by a 2023 study from the National Bureau of Economic Research showing market efficiency increases with analyst density. The shift from value to momentum investing in a late-cycle economy aligns with historical patterns; a 2021 Journal of Finance study found momentum strategies outperform value strategies by 6% annually in late economic cycles, a trend potentially amplified by India's current earnings revisions and strong domestic flows. Conversation with Sajjid Chinoy and Chetan Ahya suggest that Asia will have to brace for a slowdown, and that may make it difficult for higher growth countries like India to deliver growth too. The lone ranger was JP Morgan's Rajiv Batra, whose note suggests that this quarter will serve as a transition from underwhelming earnings to a decent recovery, driven by the low base from the previous year and a resurgence in economic momentum. Batra expects the Nifty to trade at a level between 26,500-30,000 in the next 6-9 months. When It Rains, It Pours The week had a lopsided newsflow, with the second half standing true to the adage that 'when it rains, it pours'. TCS beat earnings expectations with a better than expected delivery in net profit, but a sluggish revenue growth and a wobble around demand. CEO K Krithivasan is optimistic about new services and deal wins, despite global economic uncertainty. And this weighed in on the stock price, with the IT index coming off for three days on a trot. Meanwhile, Hindustan Unilever is shaking things up with Priya Nair set to become the first female CEO and MD in the company's 92-year history. And Glenmark Pharmaceuticals is celebrating a massive $2 billion deal with AbbVie for its cancer treatment, with a cool $700 million upfront payment. The stock has gained 25% this month, with a 15% move coming in post the announcement. Assumptions Of Dollar Dominance Forever, Are Shaky The past 25 years has seen the UK, France and US issue far too much debt, which Asian countries stacked up in their foreign exchange reserves out of fear for a new Asian crisis. The next question is whether this imbalance can endure. And, if not, how will it be resolved. The answer to the first question is increasingly obvious: Asian countries are becoming ever less fond of US treasuries, gilts and OATs. So what happens next? History shows that such imbalances usually spur an important shift in the value of exchange rates. The country that has issued too many bonds sees its currency fall, while the one that has saved too much sees its currency re-rate. Imagine what will happen to the dollar ahead! Lastly, a (not so) personal question. Fed up with your paycheck? How does $200 million-plus sound? As per a Bloomberg article, that’s what Meta is apparently paying Ruoming Pang, who used to run Apple’s AI models team. More importantly, it is in line with the compensation of other members of Meta’s new “superintelligence” group. Why is this happening? Well, we know AI is all pervasive. But there are minds like Eric Schmidt who believe that the AI revolution is 'underhyped'. If this is an indication that you are assuming that it is overhyped, maybe you should rethink your estimates or assumptions. Have a great weekend. Until Next Time... Niraj Shah

Title: Preorder NOW to get Meta's Limited Edition Oakley smart glasses before everyone else

These 24K gold-accented glasses arrive July 22 but could easily sell out before then; the rest of the Meta Oakley collection arrive later this summer. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Meta has launched preorders for its Meta Oakley HSTN Warm Gray Prizm 24K Polarized smart glasses, the first version of these glasses available. And given how quickly they're likely to sell out, you'll want to grab them while you still can! This is Meta's second Limited Edition launch in recent days, after the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition that sold out quickly on many retail sites. So far, these Meta Oakley HSTN Limited Edition glasses are only available on Meta, and there's no saying how much stock is available or if resellers will snag them all. You can wait until "later this summer" for the other HSTN frames — Desert with Ruby lenses, Black with Polar Black, Shiny Brown with Polar Deep-Water, Black with Transitions Amethyst, or Clear with Transitions Grey — and spend only $399, but without the gold accents. The Meta Oakley HSTN glasses offer portable Meta AI insights, a built-in 12MP ultrawide camera with 3024 X 4032 resolution photos, open-ear speakers, IPX4 water resistance, and eight hours of battery life — double what the Ray-Ban Meta glasses offer. This limited-edition version comes with gold accents and isn't likely to stay in stock for long! These striking Meta AI glasses measure 147 mm hinge-to-hinge or 158mm temple length, with no alternate sizes, so check your current glasses to see if they'll fit you well. Meta also doesn't seem to be selling a prescription version of the Limited Edition glasses, unfortunately. They confirmed to us that the $399 glasses pairs will be "Rx-ready" with -6.00 to +4.00 lens power, so you may want to skip this Limited Edition if you want to add some clarity to your AI glasses. If you compare the Meta Oakley HSTNs vs. the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, these Oakley glasses have faster charging, higher video resolution at 3K vs. 1080p, and double the battery life at eight hours. That last point is what makes these Meta Oakley glasses so compelling: They're much less likely to die on you during an all-day outing, especially if you use battery-burning features like Meta AI. We'd hoped that Amazon Prime Day would bring prices down on Ray-Ban Meta glasses, but they've remained stubbornly full price, up to $379. So the price gap between these and the Ray-Bans isn't that great, considering the golden flourishes that Oakley and Meta added. Overall, these Meta Oakley HSTN Limited Edition glasses are striking with their gold finishes and light frames, but some people will prefer to wait for models that aren't quite as flashy, or grab one of the cheaper Ray-Ban models for $299. Alternatively, you can wait for the third-gen Ray-Ban glasses that leaked yesterday, which are rumored to feature a battery boost.

Title: U.S. stocks move lower and pull S&P 500 back from its record

Alex Veiga, Associated Press Alex Veiga, Associated Press Leave your feedback U.S. stocks are down in morning trading Friday, pulling the market back from all-time highs, as the Trump administration escalates its tariff threats against Canada. The S&P 500 was down 0.4% a day after setting a record high. The benchmark index is on pace to post its first weekly loss in three weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 279 points, or 0.6%, as of 11:06 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.2% lower a day after climbing to an all-time high. Both indexes are also headed for weekly losses. Bond yields rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.40%, from 4.34% late Thursday. Trump said in a letter Thursday that he will raise taxes on many imported goods from Canada to 35%, deepening the rift between the longtime North American allies. The letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is an aggressive increase to the top 25% tariff rates that Trump first imposed in March. The move is the latest bid by the White House to use threats of higher tariffs on goods imported into the U.S. in hopes of securing new trade agreements with countries around the globe, even historically close trading partners like Canada. The administration had initially set Wednesday as a deadline for countries to make deals with the U.S. or face heavy increases in tariffs. But with just two trade deals announced since April, one with the United Kingdom and one with Vietnam, the window for negotiations has been now been extended to Aug. 1. Trump also floated this week that he would impose tariffs of as much as 200% on pharmaceutical drugs and placed a 50% tariff on copper imports, matching the rates charged on steel and aluminum. The initial rollout of Trump’s tariff policies in the spring roiled financial markets. But Wall Street has been relatively stable in recent weeks, with stocks steadily rising to record levels, suggesting the market has mostly adjusted to the unpredictability of Trump’s rapidly shifting tariffs. Trade policy aside, the market is now set to shift at least some of its focus on companies due to report quarterly earnings over the next few weeks. On Friday, Levi Strauss jumped 10.9% after the jeans maker easily beat Wall Street’s sales and profit targets and raised its full-year forecast, despite expecting higher costs from tariffs. PriceSmart climbed 6.6% a day after the warehouse club operator delivered solid third-quarter results and said it’s looking into expanding into Chile. Earnings season shifts into high gear next week with JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup among the big banks due to report their results on Tuesday. Wall Street analysts predict that companies in the S&P 500 will deliver 5% growth in second-quarter earnings, according to FactSet. That would mark the lowest rate since the fourth quarter of 2023. Shares in financial sector, health care and communication services companies were the biggest weights on the market Friday. Visa fell 1.5%, Gilead Sciences dropped 3.2% and Meta was 1.8% lower. Some big tech stocks rose. Chimpaker Nvidia was up 1.8%. Several airline stocks were down a day after encouraging quarterly results from Delta Air Lines set off a rally in the sector. Delta dropped 2.4%, United fell 3.9% and American was 4.1% lower. Elsewhere in the market, shares of T-Mobile slipped 0.6% after the Justice Department announced Thursday that it would not prevent the company from closing on its proposed $4.4 billion acquisition of U.S. Cellular. That deal, announced more than a year ago, had come under antitrust scrutiny from the Justice Department under President Joe Biden’s administration. U.S. Cellular shares rose 2.7%. Shares in aviation company Red Cat Holdings jumped 17.8% after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued orders aimed at ramping up production and deployment of drones. European stock indexes were broadly lower following a mostly lower finish in Asian markets. Meanwhile, bitcoin climbed to another all-time high Friday, briefly eclipsing $118,000 before easing back to around $117,800, according to Coindesk. Bitcoin’s price jump came amid bullish momentum across risk assets and coincides with Nvidia’s surge to a $4 trillion valuation. It also comes days before the U.S. Congress’ Crypto Week on July 14, where lawmakers will debate a series of bills that could define the regulatory framework for the industry.

Title: I'm Done with Social Media
URL: https://www.carolinecrampton.com/im-done-with-social-media/
Time Published: 2025-07-11T15:00:36Z
Full Content:
I started last year with one clear goal: 2024 was going to be the year that I finally did social media. Regular posting, a content calendar, a strategy, a plan for growth — all of that. And yet I ended the year pretty certain that I never wanted to open those apps again, let alone post my photos and words to them. How? My main motivation for wanting to conquer my long-held ambivalence about posting was because I had a book coming out in April 2024. I was very anxious about this, in part because A Body Made of Glass was not an obviously easy sell. There are a few reasons for that: it blends several genres in a hard-to-categorise way, it tackles a subject in which I am not a well-known or previously published expert, and it is highly personal. It had also, in quite a modest way, done well according to the nebulous pre-publication benchmarks that authors obsess over. It had attracted a "Big Five" publisher in the US, something I had not had before, received a BBC radio serialisation deal in the UK, and had received some decent early reviews from industry publications in both places. I felt I should be leaving no stone unturned to support the book's success, since I had been gifted opportunities that many other writers would love to have. Chances, too, that I may never have again. There are very few things that an author can practically do to make a book a success, especially after said book is written, edited and printed. Being a celebrity or personality with a pre-existing audience that adores you definitely helps, but isn't something you can suddenly decide to become four months before your publication date. Catching a particular trend or moment that causes publishers to invest heavily in promotion and booksellers to place large early orders is great too, but once the book is done that's up to them, not you. Giving off that nebulous aura of "I'm about to become a huge literary success" that seems to cling to some people and not others would be good as well, but is also pretty hard to engineer deliberately if that's not your personality or presentation (and it isn't mine). In that tense, quiet period after the book has been finalised but before anyone can buy or read it, augmenting your personal brand via the regular use of social media feels like the only concrete action you can take. Or at least it did to me, so I threw myself into it. I attended some training sessions on "social media for authors". I asked professional acquaintances with expertise for tips. I learned that Instagram and TikTok were the best platforms to target for bookish followers and that the algorithms of these platforms were, these days, only interested in vertical videos. I compiled lists of videos I could make and started filming mostly-daily updates about my experience as an author with a book coming out soon. I scoured the accounts of other authors who were more successful than me on social media for insights. I posted about every tiny bit of publicity my book got or small win I achieved. I asked people to pre-order in as many ways as I could think of. I delved into the analytics, searching for ways to optimise and improve. I spent a lot of time scrolling, and scrolling, and scrolling, hunting for the "one weird trick" that would help me make a success of this. I quickly began to feel quite uncomfortable. I'm not a natural on camera and I don't have that talent for talking effortlessly and engagingly to a lens when alone in a room that successful social media personalities need. I was forcing it all the time, making myself record multiple takes and doing things again and again until they looked "natural" (a highly unnatural behaviour). My video editing skills are basic, so turning out regular videos took me a long time. Worst of all, though, was the way in which this enterprise began to alter my mindset about the normal stuff of life. I never used to think very hard about what I wore for a casual day of writing at home, or worry about how clean the bathroom mirror was, or obsess over what narrative or story might emerge from my general jumble of accumulated tasks. It shocked me how quickly I started viewing my own life as something to film and share, rather than something to just... live. I've seen this effect described as "the devil had taken my eyes" and I feel that is accurate. Something had taken over my gaze and it wasn't something good. A new and sinister lens had appeared between me and the world. One evening, as I made my husband walk our dog past the same scenic view multiple times so that I could get the best shot of it for a video, I experienced a sudden wave of revulsion for myself and what I was doing. From then on, I began to despise the way this supposedly necessary aspect of modern authorship was intruding on parts of me that I had never meant to be available for public consumption. Worst of all, perhaps, it didn't even seem to be doing anything. The TikTok and Instagram algorithms were utterly disinterested in what I was posting. Some of my existing followers saw my videos and interacted with them, but the promise that this kind of regular video posting would expose my work to lots of new potential readers was never fulfilled. Instagram's analytics showed that although I had a couple of thousand followers, only a few hundred of them were even seeing what I was posting. On Twitter, where I had nearly ten thousand followers that had mostly been accumulated during my previous work as a political journalist, the figures were even worse. Most of my TikToks barely made it to views in three figures. Clearly, I was doing it wrong. But how? I couldn't find any answers, although there's a seemingly inexhaustible supply of information out there on this topic. Everyone in this space seemed to publicly agree that "social media was really important for book promotion" and pointed to the viral success of various books on BookTok, but nobody was able to go into more detail about how this was achieved, or if it was even applicable to a non-fiction book by a non-celebrity author. When I tried to explore this world, it seemed to me like the old-fashioned word-of-mouth effect was just being channeled through a new medium. Books mostly weren't gaining momentum on TikTok because their authors were making top notch viral videos, but because readers and bookish influencers were recommending them to each other and posting about their experiences. It was the quality of the book, the canny distribution of advance reading copies and marketing materials by publishers, and the work's ability to speak to a moment that made the difference. I didn't really see how my own social media activities could fit into this ecosystem. People would either find and like the book, or they wouldn't. Did I even need to be there? Every time I posted, I felt worse. From the outside, my attempts to "do" social media seriously probably looked inconsequential, but they consumed a major portion of my thoughts. What I was doing felt inauthentic and, as the book came out and started getting reviews, like boasting for no reason other than to boast. The choppy nature of the algorithms meant that there was no consistent community on these apps with whom I was sharing my progress through the publishing process and no guarantee even that those were interested would see what I was sharing. When I did in-person events about the book and spoke to readers over the signing table, they would tell me that they had come because they had liked my first book, or enjoyed my current podcast, Shedunnit, or had been a fan of my old one, SRSLY. One person drove several hours to see me at a literary festival because I had put a link to the event in a postscript in my sporadic email newsletter. Nobody I met had been motivated by what I had been doing on social media, even though making those posts had been consuming the vast majority of the time and effort I had to devote to book promotion. This is anecdotal data, for sure, but so much of how the success or otherwise of a book is defined is vibes-based that I felt fine about allowing it to inform me. It only backed up what the social media platforms' analytics had been telling me, anyway. By the mid point of last year my book had been out for a couple of months and the expectation to market it as much as possible was dying away. My anxiety simmered down to the point where I could assess matters more objectively. This was situation as I saw it: I had put a lot of work time and mental energy into social media because I had been told by lots of trustworthy sources — like people who worked in publishing, fellow authors and my writers' union — that it was the best way to help my book reach as many interested readers as possible. In fact, my posts had reached very few people and contributed very little to the success of the book. Plus, they were very time consuming to make so had eaten up leisure time and my capacity to do other work. There had also been negative side effects in the form of vastly increased screen time and that disagreeable mental habit of seeing my entire existence as potential posts. There was only one possible conclusion: social media was not for me. More than that, I felt that there was something of an "emperor's new clothes" situation at work. Being a social media star is a skillset completely distinct from being someone who writes books — they may overlap occasionally, but it's not the norm. Yet I suspect that every non-celebrity and midlist author will have felt the pressure at some point to "be more active on social media" because otherwise they aren't "pulling their weight" for their book. I wasn't alone in finding that the effort:reward ratio was entirely out of whack, either. Plenty of peers that I spoke to with online creative businesses were happy to share their experiences of withdrawing partially or fully from social media (for all sorts of reasons including harassment, burnout and parenting) only to find that their sales were largely or even entirely unaffected the next time they had a project to promote. One had closed an account with a following in the six figures and switched to communicating with customers only via an email newsletter, and business was even better than before (likely because all of those subscribed were actually receiving the emails they had signed up for). I began to wonder. Was this all, in fact, nonsense? The publishing industry is going through a period of great volatility at the moment, for many reasons including but not limited to rising production costs, encroaching celebrity culture, corporate greed and the advent of AI. Traditional publicity opportunities like television/radio interviews and print reviews are becoming less and less effective at getting the word out about books as fewer people tune in. The digital alternatives have, so far, not offered a like for like replacement for the old marketing ecosystem. From my perspective as a traditionally-published, non-celebrity author, it feels like nobody really knows what makes a book sell anymore. I think the persistent advice to authors to "do social media" is, at best, part of a strategy that can be generously described as throwing everything at the proverbial wall in the hope that something, anything, will stick. Being more cynical, I think it might sometimes be a way of keeping authors quiet, of transferring the responsibility for their book's success on to their shoulders and occupying them doing something that feels productive so they don't ask too many awkward questions. It's busy work. That's all without considering the role of the platforms themselves in this. I spent several months last year feeling grim about the amount of free content I had uploaded to platforms owned by the likes of Meta and Elon Musk. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok — these are all outlets that purport to capture and manipulate their users' attention, meaning that, as a "creator", if you catch the wave of the algorithm just right you can surf it all the way to a huge following, then fame and fortune. I don't doubt that the select few who make this equation work for them do get well paid for their work once they become successful. Everyone else, though, is just uploading for free so that there is enough stuff on the app to keep users scrolling forever. Infinite scroll means infinite ad inventory. The platforms also invest in promoting the idea that being a "full time creator" is an attainable goal and incentivise their top creators to sell the idea that anyone can achieve their success, if they just start now and work really hard for nothing as long as is necessary. The more I thought about it, the harder it became not to view the so-called creator economy as a blatant pyramid scheme underwritten by some of the worst corporations in the world. The way to succeed is to get in early, then become an aspirational figure to those who come along later. I'm being deliberately blunt to make my point. If you enjoy watching happy videos of dogs and uploading pictures of your holidays for your friends, I'm delighted for you. If making videos and sharing them online is your hobby, all power to you. As part of a viable creative career, though, where a living wage and sustainable workload is the goal, social media now feels to me like a long con that just hasn't been exposed yet. I've never been a whole-hearted lover of social media, nor a great adept at it. I only signed up for Facebook at university because it was necessary for being involved in the student newspaper, and then I deleted my account a few years later when I had a scary experience with a stalker. I rejoined when I moved out of London, naively believing it would help me make new local friends, which it did not. I got Twitter when someone on my journalism training course laughed at me because I didn't already have an account and then almost never posted on it, even when the platform was at its dizzying heights of relevance for those in the media. I once went mildly viral for a snarky tweet during a televised election debate and found the experience so horrifying that I never wanted to repeat it. Instagram was better, for a while — my corner of it was mostly friends and dogs and knitting — but then the feed became algorithmic instead of chronological and I almost never saw the things I liked in a sensible order. Social media was never a wholly cosy or useful place for me, although I was utterly addicted to it for a number of years because "being a journalist" in the 2010s felt synonymous with "being on social media all the time". This idea was so deeply rooted in me that when I worked somewhere with such terrible computers that they couldn't even handle refreshing a Twitter feed, I bought an iPad with my own money so that I could have a device next to me all day that was continually showing the latest posts. At the time, I barely made more than the London Living Wage, rent took three quarters of my monthly pay after tax, and I walked an hour to work every day because I couldn't afford to take the Tube. In those circumstances, buying an expensive tablet just so I never had to be separated from the latest tweets is absurd, even irresponsible. And yet I did it, because I had utterly internalised the idea that social media was the route to writing success. Years later, even knowing what I now knew, it took months to work myself up to quitting and even longer to say out loud what I had done and why. Once I had made up my mind to mentally uncouple myself from social media, it was shockingly easy to do. I deleted the apps from my phone and changed the passwords to my accounts, recording them somewhere inconvenient so that I could log in via the desktop versions if necessary but it took more than a couple of taps or clicks. A few weeks in, I took stock of what I felt like I was missing and the list was surprisingly short: Taylor Swift content, chats with friends, the occasional funny picture of a dog. I replaced all of these pretty easily: I signed up to a couple of music podcasts and Patreons, made an effort to be more regular about phoning and texting people, and just enjoyed the dogs that I saw out and about in the world. The benefits were just as quick to come. That feeling of seeing the world only as potential future content receded, I started reading more books, and my screen time fell drastically. I felt released from a burden I hadn't noticed I was carrying. I had become so accustomed to the sense of shame at not being better at offering up my life for successful consumption that I only realised how acute that feeling had been now that it was gone. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop, for someone very influential in my industry to swoop down and reprimand me for my actions, to declare that I had irrevocably failed at "being a writer". But nothing bad happened. At all. Those apps had become so barren of joy or purpose for me that I didn't miss the experience of being on them, either as a creator or a user, at all. By the end of the year, packaging chunks of myself to share on questionable corporate platforms for strangers to watch and judge felt like a really weird thing to do. I talked about it in therapy and imagined trying to explain this practice to my eleven-year-old self who had really wanted to spend her life writing stories. The more time that passes, the odder it feels that I spent a decade and a half of my life believing that social media was a vital part of being a writer. Others may have different experiences, but because I was never a consummate poster I never received work opportunities or made friends or found a partner through these apps. Maybe if I had, I would feel like there had been more of a fair exchange. I just allowed them to occupy a large chunk of my brain for nothing. Where does this leave me? I ended 2024 absolutely sure that social media was not for me, a complete reversal of my position at the start of the year. I'm not moving to the woods and throwing my phone in the bin, though. Beyond the reassuringly steady drip of Taylor Swift videos, there was one overarching benefit to being active on social media as a writer that I want to retain, and that is having a way to be in touch with those who are interested in my work. I've spent most of 2025 so far working out what that might look like. I still like the internet and what it can do for us — quite honestly, I don't think I would have a job at all without it — but I want to use it on my terms and in a way that feels good for me rather than harmful. If that means that my potential audience is much smaller, so be it. After much reflection during, I have come to realise that I'd rather talk to a small number of people and be happy doing it than try to reach a huge audience but be miserable. I started small, making the change for my podcast. I did a "farewell" post on the show's accounts and replaced them with an enhanced email newsletter. I expected some pushback and braced myself for a dip in listenership, which I decided that I was willing to accept as the price I paid for independence and greater peace of mind. Neither materialised. I received lots of supportive messages from people with their own growing reservations about social media. The podcast's newsletter now has more active subscribers than we ever had followers. There has been no discernible fall in audience, vindicating my suspicions that our posts hadn't really been doing anything to direct people away from the apps and towards the podcast anyway. Best of all, I'm enjoying writing to the podcast's listeners every week. I am no longer guiltily pushing the "do podcast social media" tasks to the bottom of my to do list all the time. Taking this step for the podcast first has allowed me to come to some decisions about my personal internet presence, too. I have realised that I only want to post on a platform where I have control, with no algorithms or anything else coming between me and the people who want to see what I'm doing. I'm a writer and I think in paragraphs and chapters, not in videos or captions. I think it's about time I played to my strengths, rather than trying to fit myself into a format that I've never found to be comfortable. So, I decided to add a blog to my website and that will now be my home on the internet[1]. I gave it a tagline that hopefully reflects this new stage of my online life: "A blog by a writer attempting to live the literary good life on the internet". Because that's what I'm trying to do now. The quality of the life now is more important than any potential reward in the future. Although the blog will be the main home for all my stuff (you can follow it via RSS and I think you should, because RSS is possibly the best and purest tech we still have) I'll still be sending some posts out as newsletters too. Personal essays where I think out loud (like this one), my Thursday links round up, reading reflections, and a new series I'm about to start titled "Caroline Writes a Novel" (!). Because lots of people have been in touch to say they miss the photos of my dog I used to post on Instagram, there will be a sporadic "photo diary" mail out too where Morris will feature heavily. If you'd like to receive those you can sign up here, or if you already subscribe you can use this menu to adjust which types of posts you receive. I have no plans at the moment to put up a paywall or make extra premium content, but I do have the subscription feature turned on so if anyone really wants to make a financial contribution, they can. I must stress that you won't receive any extra material or benefits if you do so. For now, this is a Medici-style "patron of the arts" situation. Everything is free for everyone, supported by those who have the means and desire to do so. I also want to stress that I absolutely do not need your contributions for basic necessities or survival — this is just a way for those who can to support work that they like if they so choose. There's also an option for a one-off tip if you feel inclined to give one. You should feel no pressure or obligation to do so, though. If you're more into a "extra content for a fee" model, then you might want to consider joining the paid membership element of my podcast. If all of this — a non-famous writer with a podcast deciding she's replacing Instagram with blogging — feels too inconsequential to write 4,500 words about, then you're not alone. I think so too, but I also couldn't not write this. In fact, I've been tapping away at a draft of this post for months, trying to get my feelings about it straight. I might be well on the way to breaking the habit of reflexively viewing the world around me as possible nuggets of content, but even after the somewhat bruising experience of putting out two autobiographical books, I still think best with my fingers on a keyboard and a publication date in mind. In this instance, I do feel like I'm answering a question nobody has asked, though. I think quite regularly about the, at the time very funny, ebook that Grace Dent published in 2011 titled How to Leave Twitter: My Time as Queen of the Universe and Why This Must Stop, in which she lampooned her own social media addiction and the absurd phenomenon of too-online people with tiny followings grandiloquently announcing that they wouldn't be online for the next three hours. What is this, if not that? It feels fitting, though, to mark the end of this chapter in a needlessly performative way. Even though I was terrible at posting, I did spend fifteen years watching human behaviour evolve on these platforms. It was bound to rub off on me a bit. I still don't know if I will delete my old social media accounts. I want to, because it feels more final that way, more like a definitive statement about who I am now and what I am doing. Maybe that's why I shouldn't, though. That was a version of me too, the one who agonised over every angle and caption, who couldn't see the light hitting the water just so without imagining Instagram's square frame around it, who believed that all her dreams would come true if she could just crack Meta's code. She was trying her best, just like I am now. She can live on as a ghost in that machine for now, a bodiless reminder of an existence I never really had. For those who might be wondering why I'm not starting a Substack, it's because I don't like Substack as a company or the direction their platform seems to be headed in (I was there for Facebook's "pivot to video" and I remember who it screwed over). I'm using Ghost, a non-profit website and newsletter platform, and I'm very happy with it. I'd highly recommend it. ↩︎

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, July 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) and reminds investors of the July 21, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. The complaint alleges that the truth was revealed on February 27, 2025, when DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending and the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. Defendants also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify's stock price dropped $7.83 per share, or 36%, from a closing price of $21.73 on February 27, 2025, to a closing price of $13.90 on February 28, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding DoubleVerify’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

AMD stock price surged over 4% after HSBC upgraded it to ‘Buy’ and raised the target price to $200, signaling nearly 40% upside. HSBC is now bullish on AMD’s MI300X and MI350 AI chips, which are gaining ground against NVIDIA’s GPUs. Big names like Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI are adopting AMD accelerators, fueling growth in its AI business. With a $5 billion AI revenue target by 2025 and rising demand across hyperscalers, analysts believe AMD is well-positioned for a major run. Investor confidence is rising, and Wall Street is now betting on AMD to challenge NVIDIA in AI chips.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) AES Corp.(NYSE:AES) is not usually a stock that makes headlines for significant price fluctuations, but investors were startled this week when it increased almost 20% in just one session on Wednesday. So, what is the reason for this sudden interest? It all comes down to discussions of a potential acquisition. As per reports from Bloomberg and other outlets, AES is reportedly considering strategic alternatives, including a possible sale of the company. Such news typically captures investors' attention—particularly when major players like Blackstone, Brookfield, and BlackRock’s infrastructure division are speculated to be involved. While AES stock has experienced volatility, if you're looking for upside with less risk than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative – having outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. However, this is not solely about merger and acquisition speculation. AES has a significant role in the clean energy transition, providing renewable energy to major tech firms such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta. With the demand for energy from AI data centers and cloud computing soaring, AES's assets appear much more valuable. Despite recently encountering challenges—like reduced subsidies for renewable initiatives due to changing U.S. policies—the long-term demand narrative remains strong. In essence, merger chatter + AI-driven energy demand = investor enthusiasm. Regardless of whether the buyout rumors materialize or not, AES has just reminded the market that it might deserve a closer examination. Not fond of the unpredictable nature of AES stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has demonstrated a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four years. What is the reason for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have offered superior returns with less risk when compared to the benchmark index; a smoother experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Going cheap on AI talent is no way to achieve leadership: Let’s learn from Meta

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. With Meta offering up to $100 million as sign-up bonuses to hire artificial intelligence (AI) talent, it has set the new global price of intelligence. Across the US and China, compensation for top talent in AI, quantum computing and other strategic technologies has decoupled entirely from traditional salary frameworks. What was once considered an executive-level package is now being paid to domain specialists, engineers and scientists. In India, we speak confidently of becoming global champions in AI, semiconductors and battery innovation. But are we ready to pay for the talent required to get us there? Also Read: Star chase: Why Mark Zuckerberg is deploying billions to acquire hot AI talent like Alexandr Wang for Meta Corporate India, particularly its promoter-led enterprises, still has a rigid compensation culture. Even the most admired Indian tech companies rarely exceed $1 million in fixed compensation for high-end domain talent, preferring to offer stock or deferred incentives instead. Across the board, executive pay continues to outpace technical pay by a wide margin—even in companies that market themselves as product-first. Imagine a promoter approving even a tenth of Meta’s figure—say, $10 million annually—for a single hire in AI. HR would instinctively reach for the cost-to-company (CTC) template. Legal teams would load the contract with clawbacks and non-competes. And someone around the table would inevitably ask whether this was more than the entire tech team earns. This reflects a discomfort with the idea that a young knowledge-led mind—often without pedigree, polish or deference—could command industrial-level value. It is a problem of culture. Indian businesses have long been comfortable investing $50 million in a new factory or plant. But offering even $5 million to a knowledge architect who can design the core of a future-facing product feels excessive. This inversion, where management is rewarded more than the minds building the product, is one of Indian technology’s least acknowledged handicaps. It’s not because the talent doesn’t exist. India continues to produce some of the best AI researchers, quantum physicists and deep tech engineers in the world. But our systems expect them to settle for prestige, purpose or passion. Also Read: Siddharth Pai: India’s IT firms have a unique opportunity in AI’s trust deficit There’s a persistent myth that because India’s tech talent is “mission-driven" and that it will accept under-compensation in return for vision or national pride. That might work if you’re a global frontrunner offering unmatched exposure. But when that same talent has offers from research labs in Silicon Valley, Zurich or Singapore—with salaries 8 to 100 times higher—purpose alone won’t bridge the gap. Vision must be paired with valuation: Across the world, many governments and corporations understand this. The UAE has appointed a minister for AI. Singapore offers co-funded AI fellowships with public-private partnerships. Germany’s AI strategy includes billions in subsidies tied to industrial research teams. These are economic bets on the future of productivity. India’s response so far has been largely declarative: strategies, mission and some funding. But talent doesn’t read these documents. It reads offers, options and opportunities. Also Read: Manu Joseph: Why nobody talks about India’s ‘brain drain’ anymore There is precedent for bold compensation in India’s business history. Two decades ago, during the retail boom, one of India’s largest conglomerates hired 15-plus marquee CEOs at salaries reportedly several times higher than their previous pay. It was a bold bet—one that catalyzed knowledge transfer, global systems and new processes. But once the infrastructure was built, the appetite for such talent faded. The notion that talent is fungible took root again. In deep tech sectors, that assumption won’t hold. In the technology era, talent must be treated as strategic capital expenditure. Hiring a world-class AI researcher is like the first kilometre of pipeline in a new industrial system. Yet, most Indian promoters would find it ego-challenging to write that check unless the individual’s value could be directly tied to revenues already realized, or probably the talent is in their bloodline. That mindset is precisely what could cost us the future. Also Read: Beware India Inc., headhunters are poaching your talent for themselves It’s no longer sufficient to celebrate Indian-origin AI leaders at DeepMind, Google or OpenAI. If we underpay the very talent we claim to revere, we aren’t reversing brain drain—we’re subsidizing innovation elsewhere. And the problem runs deeper than compensation structures. Indian business culture still places enormous symbolic value on control, lineage and loyalty. It’s far more comfortable rewarding long-term insiders than investing aggressively in external experts. But deep tech respects none of these traditional codes. It rewards only edge. The question is not whether India has the financial bandwidth but whether it has the emotional maturity to accept that true capability may reside in those who don’t conform to existing hierarchies. Even India’s startup ecosystem hasn’t escaped this gravity. Founders flush with venture capital hesitate to offer globally competitive salaries to specialist talent. Many prefer to overhire generalists rather than back one game-changing domain expert. Performance-linked employee stock options are useful but they’re no substitute for upfront recognition of value. The test of the new economy is not regulation, nor market access. It isn’t equity capital either—these are traditional entry barriers that large Indian firms are comfortable overcoming. The real question is whether they can recognize that in a world of knowledge-driven industries, intellect is infrastructure. The question then is no longer whether we can afford to pay top talent. It is whether we can afford not to. The author is a corporate advisor and author of ‘Family and Dhanda’ Download the Mint app and read premium stories Log in to our website to save your bookmarks.

Title: Valuation Check: Is Nvidia still a buy after the surge?

Nvidia’s stock closed at $164.10 on Thursday, gaining 0.75% during the day. This pushed the chipmaker’s total market value to $4.004 trillion, marking the first time it ended a trading session above this milestone. With this, Nvidia has extended its lead over tech giants Apple and Microsoft, reinforcing its dominance in the AI-driven tech rally. (Source: Reuters) Nvidia’s high-performance processors are central to the AI infrastructure being built by major tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms. These firms are investing heavily in artificial intelligence data centres, and Nvidia's chips are powering much of that transformation, making the company a key enabler in the ongoing AI revolution. After reaching a $1 trillion market capitalisation in June 2023, Nvidia has tripled its value in just about a year—a feat unmatched by even the largest tech firms. Microsoft is currently valued at $3.73 trillion, while Apple, impacted by slower AI integration, has slipped to $3.17 trillion after a 15% decline in its stock price this year. Despite its impressive growth, Nvidia faces some challenges. Rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China could affect its ability to export its most powerful chips. Analysts also caution that as AI adoption becomes more widespread, demand might shift to more affordable alternatives, posing a competitive threat to Nvidia’s high-margin products. Even with its meteoric rise, Nvidia’s stock is currently trading at around 33 times expected earnings. This is actually lower than its five-year average price-to-earnings ratio of 41, according to LSEG. While lofty, the valuation is not considered excessively stretched relative to its historical norm, indicating investor confidence in sustained future growth.

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts Three Big Things This Week: Jason’s Directness: “It will be the biggest issue of 2026, I think, in B2B AI is just the inability to recruit talent… If you think your answer is to go hire a VP of AI that wears a tie and is studying things like just shut the startup down.” The AI talent war will separate winners from losers more brutally than any previous technology cycle. Rory’s Reality: “The truth is there’s a small number of things that are working really well, and everything else looks dull in comparison… So if you start to pull ahead, provided you continue to execute, it’s very hard to catch up.” Market dynamics now favor extreme concentration of success, making early leads nearly insurmountable. Harry’s Honesty: “If you don’t want to embrace [AI], you are going to make this ship sink… If you need a week for rediscovery week, I promise you, you’re not going to work.” The AI adoption window has closed – adapt immediately or become irrelevant. The venture capital and SaaS landscape is experiencing seismic shifts that will fundamentally reshape how companies compete, hire, and operate. In the latest episode of the 20VC podcast, three industry leaders dissected the most critical developments defining 2025’s market dynamics. The business world was stunned when Daniel Gross and Nat Friedman, two of Silicon Valley’s most respected figures, abandoned their $1.1 billion venture fund NFDG to join Meta. The mathematics behind this decision reveal the extraordinary economics reshaping the industry. According to the podcast analysis, NFDG had deployed roughly $500 million of their fund and achieved a 4x return in just two years – generating approximately $1.5 billion in gains and $300 million in carried interest for the partners. Despite this stellar performance, Meta’s offer was compelling enough to walk away from an additional $1.5 billion in investable capital. NFDG: The $1.1B VC Fund That 4X’d in Two Years—Then Got Acquired by Meta The Strategic Implications This wasn’t just an acqui-hire; it represents Meta’s systematic approach to building an “AI talent magnet.” As Jason Lemkin noted, “The best want to work for the best… and the tough thing is they want to work for the prominent best in many cases.” Meta’s strategy mirrors what worked at X (formerly Twitter) under Elon Musk – creating a “mega mecca for talent” that attracts top performers who refuse to settle for anything less than excellence. This approach is becoming essential because, as the speakers emphasized, struggling companies can’t attract great talent regardless of their growth metrics. Perhaps the most sobering discussion centered on the emerging talent crisis in B2B AI. The numbers are staggering: companies are now offering $800,000+ annual packages plus RSUs and guarantees to secure top AI engineering talent. One founder shared that he’s giving away 0.5-1% equity stakes to each AI engineer – unsustainable math at scale. The success of companies like Cursor is creating ripple effects throughout the industry. As one multi-billion dollar company founder told Lemkin, “My single biggest challenge today is cursor… they’re just paying insane amounts of money for everyone.” This creates an existential question for SaaS companies: How do you compete when you can’t afford the talent war? The speakers identified several harsh realities: One of the most fascinating discussions revealed how dramatically investor expectations have shifted. The traditional SaaS growth trajectory of “triple, triple, double, double” (tripling revenue for two years, then doubling for two years) is no longer exciting in today’s market. Why Traditional SaaS Metrics Are Losing Their Luster Rory O’Driscoll explained the new mathematics: “If there’s two games and one of them has that embedded 10% chance of amazing, like 20 billion, a cursor outcome, and one of them just doesn’t… there’s no price at which you’ll do it.” This creates a painful reality for solid, profitable SaaS companies growing at 20-25% annually. They’re caught in a valley between: The Toma Bravo acquisition of Olo (a profitable, $320M ARR company) for $2 billion at 6.5x revenue exemplifies this dynamic. It’s a “meat and potatoes deal” that provides decent returns but doesn’t generate life-changing wealth for investors. OpenAI’s revelation that stock-based compensation exceeded 119% of revenue last year highlights a critical issue facing high-growth companies. While the accounting can be misleading (based on 409A valuations rather than actual dilution), the trend signals dangerous territory for many startups. The Churchill Principle As Jason Lemkin eloquently put it: “No one ever said to Winston Churchill, did you bring World War Two in on budget? They just said, did you win World War II? When it becomes existential, you do what you have to do to win.” This philosophy is driving companies to prioritize market dominance over financial efficiency, leading to unsustainable compensation inflation that will impact venture returns for years. CoreWeave’s $9 billion acquisition of Core Scientific demonstrates sophisticated use of inflated stock prices. By converting rental expenses into equity dilution, they’ve reduced fixed costs while maintaining upside exposure to data center demand. This move shows how companies with high-multiple stocks can strategically de-risk their business models. Canva’s “AI Discovery Week” – requiring all 5,000 employees to pause regular work and learn AI – represents a gentler approach to what many see as an inevitable reckoning. The speakers were divided on this approach: The underlying message is clear: companies can’t afford to carry employees who resist AI adoption. The podcast’s analysis of recession probabilities and market dynamics revealed sophisticated thinking about current risks: The discussion reveals several critical strategic imperatives: Perhaps most sobering was the discussion of venture capital’s current challenges. Deal volume has hit an eight-year low while spectacular successes capture all attention and capital. This creates a “flight to consensus” where: The speakers agreed that most VCs are spending their time managing disappointing portfolio companies from 2020-2021 that are growing at 10-30% rather than the explosive rates initially projected. The conversation painted a picture of an industry in transition, where traditional rules no longer apply: The overarching theme is clear: we’re witnessing the emergence of a two-tier market where AI-enabled companies with top talent operate in a different league from traditional businesses. For SaaS leaders, the choice is stark – transform or risk irrelevance in an increasingly AI-driven world. Jason on talent reality: “I was with the founder this morning of a multi-billion dollar company… they said my single biggest challenge today is cursor… cursor’s just paying insane amounts of money for everyone.” Harry on employee expectations: “If you need a discovery week for AI, you have people who aren’t curious enough to want to progress and running their job… I said you fire them.” Rory on the Churchill principle: “No one ever said to Winston Churchill, did you bring World War Two in on budget? They just said, did you win World War II? When it becomes existential, you do what you have to do to win.” Rory on recession probability: “Booms don’t die of old age… just because it’s been great for six or seven years doesn’t mean that it has to die in the eight.” Companies that act decisively on talent, AI adoption, and strategic positioning will thrive, while those clinging to old playbooks risk being left behind in what promises to be the most transformative period in business software history.

Paolo Confino is a reporter on Fortune’s global news desk where he covers each day’s most important stories. Wall Street is betting Nvidia can make stock market history again. After the chipmaker powered its way to a $4 trillion valuation, the first company to ever reach the milestone, analysts still see room for the stock to grow. The upside for Nvidia, according to its biggest bulls, remains incomplete. There are more returns to be had, they argue. Nvidia is one of the most beloved stocks by investors. It seems to have ridden the stock market exuberance of AI more than any other company. Investors continue to reiterate its strength as the purveyor of the best AI chips that hyperscalers like Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon use. Of the 79 analysts who currently follow Nvidia, 69 rate it a buy, according to Bloomberg. That’s good for an 87% buy rating among analysts. Only 11 rate it a hold. And just one lone holdout lists it as a sell. On Thursday, after Nvidia hit the $4 trillion mark, some analysts were unfazed at the prospect that perhaps the chipmaker had reached its stock market peak. At least three analysts published new reports rating the stock a buy, according to Bloomberg data. Goldman Sachs, Keybanc Capital Markets, and Bocom International, the subsidiary of Hong Kong’s Bank of Communications, all listed Nvidia as either a buy or an overweight. Their price targets ranged from $175 to $190, implying growth of between 8.1% and 17.4% for Nvidia stock from the $161.84 per share at the time of publication. Despite Nvidia’s valuation, its fundamentals don’t point to an expensive or overpriced stock, according to Paul Meeks, chief investment officer at 17 Asset Management. “The stock has come far, but sales, earnings, and cash flows have come farther,” he told Fortune. Indeed, Nvidia has delivered outstanding financial performance. Its latest quarterly earnings saw it bringing $44 billion in revenue, a 69% increase from the prior year, according to company filings. Its margins remain plump, coming in at 60% over the same quarter. Its balance sheet remains rock-solid with $111 billion in total assets compared to $32 billion in total liabilities in its 2025 fiscal year. Goldman was undeterred by Nvidia’s recent record valuation. It called worries about Nvidia’s sky-high price “peak concerns” in an analyst note published on Thursday. “We believe Nvidia will remain the primary beneficiary of the ongoing AI infrastructure buildout,” Goldman semiconductor analyst James Schneider wrote. Analysts built their bull case for Nvidia around the fact that it remains the market leader in all the components used to develop AI systems and that the market for all of those products will only grow over the next few years. Nvidia has also spent the last couple years diversifying its offerings. “Nvidia’s well beyond the chips,” Meeks said. The company also has a suite of software and networking gear used for things like gaming and developing robotics. Nvidia’s believers also often point to early signs that AI companies are finally starting to monetize the technology. Once that happens, demand for Nvidia’s products will only grow. AI firms have already started to push further into the consumer tech market. Perplexity released an AI-powered web browser and OpenAI is slated to launch one soon. Major cloud service providers like Amazon and Alphabet will also start to incorporate more AI tech into their services which will only further boost Nvidia’s sales, according to longtime tech bull Dan Ives. “The impact of the AI cycle on consumer Internet will be massive and it will start with the cloud service divisions,” Ives wrote on Thursday. “[Amazon and Alphabet] acquire AI-capable chips, build AI-capable service offerings, and sell those services into their respective installed bases.” But Nvidia’s fate is ultimately linked to that of its biggest customers. As they continue to spend, the stock will continue to soar. The day that they pull back their billions in AI investments is the day Nvidia’s gets “crushed,” Meeks said. “Only thing that would cause a bloodletting here is if we got a sense that major AI spenders pull back,” he said. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Meta is trying to win the AI race with money — but not everyone can be bought

﻿Zuckerberg is picking off top talent from across the industry, and OpenAI might be more vulnerable than most. ﻿Zuckerberg is picking off top talent from across the industry, and OpenAI might be more vulnerable than most. Month after month, message after message, the AI engineer was hearing from Meta recruiters. The recruiters were pestering him to leave his employer and switch over to support the company’s AI efforts, and they were offering a sizable salary package to do so. But he wasn’t so sure. The engineer, who works for a startup that was acquired by a leading AI company and requested anonymity from The Verge, said he had heard from friends that the company expected a lot of personal sacrifices in exchange for its high salaries, whether on employees’ value systems when it comes to Al or work-life balance. Engineers there, he heard, were working around the clock to catch up with rival companies like OpenAl, Anthropic, Google, and Microsoft. With so many firms desperately scrambling for AI talent, Meta was offering between $1–1.4 million in total annual compensation (which is typically measured as a combination of salary, annual bonus, and amortized stock value) for many AI roles. But, he suspected, its offers might be less generous than they sounded — tied heavily to subjective performance metrics that could be weaponized against employees. And just as importantly, he wasn’t willing to give up a semblance of work-life balance and a healthy work environment to make a few hundred thousand dollars more. He didn’t pursue the opportunity. In recent months, Meta has launched on an AI hiring spree after making its largest-ever external investment: a $14.3 billion acquisition of a 49 percent stake in Scale AI, an industry giant that provides training data to fuel the technology of companies like OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, and Meta. As part of the deal, Meta spun up a brand-new superintelligence lab led by Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang — and to staff the lab, it started poaching. Meta has reportedly poached as many as 10 of OpenAI’s top researchers and model developers, with some pay packages reportedly adding up to $300 million over four years, including equity. (Meta disputes this figure.) It’s also approached a slew of other top AI talent across the industry. Ruoming Pang, who heads up Apple’s foundation AI models team, reportedly departed for Meta, and at least two Anthropic employees and two DeepMind employees have reportedly joined the team as well. The goal is to secure Meta’s spot in the race to achieve artificial general intelligence, or AGI: a hypothetical AI system that equals or surpasses human cognitive abilities, and the moving target that almost every AI company is currently chasing at breakneck speed. Meta’s primary weapon is vast amounts of money. But some sources across the AI industry question whether that will be enough. Meta, to date, has not been the most exciting destination for budding AI engineers Meta, to date, has not been the most exciting destination for budding AI engineers. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been trying to make up for lost ground in the AI race, having spent years and significant resources over-indexing on the metaverse while competitors like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon invested billions in AI startups and signed cloud contracts and other deals. The company’s Llama AI models often rank low on publicly maintained performance leaderboards; at time of writing, Meta’s first appearance on one such leaderboard, Chatbot Arena, was at No. 30. In May, it reportedly delayed the launch of its new flagship AI model as developers struggled to deliver performance upgrades, and executives have been public on earnings calls about the need to aggressively invest and shore up against competition. The Scale AI deal, and Meta’s subsequent sky-high budget for hiring AI talent, is Zuckerberg’s Hail Mary: paying a premium for some of the brightest minds in the AI world to safeguard Meta’s future. But although Meta is plying AI workers with staggering salaries, a mountain of money can’t buy everyone. Anthropic and DeepMind have reportedly had far fewer defections to Meta than OpenAI has, and that’s been an ongoing trend. The reason, to those inside the field, is obvious: the AI world is filled with true believers, and even the biggest companies need more than a cash offer to get many of them on their side. Industry insiders emphasized to The Verge that in a sector where almost any company will offer job security and a good salary, experienced AI engineers and researchers want to work somewhere that aligns with their values, whether their top priority is AI safety and the risks the tech poses for humanity’s future, the ethical considerations of AI’s impact on society today, or accelerating and advancing the tech quicker than anyone else. Some engineers, researchers, or scientists the company has approached have turned down Meta’s advances, industry sources tell The Verge. Competition for AI researchers is stiff, and building loyalty is vital. “At this point, at least a few hundred top researchers and engineers in the field are what’s sometimes called ‘post-money’ — they could retire, and you’re only going to attract or retain them if they believe in your vision, leadership style, etc.,” one AI industry source says. But especially at OpenAI, Meta seems to have found the dollar value of company loyalty — and exceeded it. OpenAI has been uniquely affected by Meta’s mission to poach leading AI talent. As many as 10 of its top researchers and model developers have reportedly joined Meta, with some receiving large signing bonuses and equity. While its size and talent make it an inevitable prime target, the company is also vulnerable due to a controversial restructuring from a nonprofit to for-profit venture and the departures of high-profile executives who went on to start competing AI companies. It underwent a huge upheaval during Sam Altman’s November 2023 ouster by OpenAI’s board and his subsequent Uno Reverse-style rehiring, which saw most of the board members who opposed him resign. Employees have also shared concerns about non-disparagement agreements and policies that raised questions about whether they would be able to access their equity, eroding some trust in leadership even when the policies were walked back. “A lot of the people working on this are genuinely convinced they’re building transformative technology that will reshape the world,” one source familiar with the situation tells The Verge. “For the people that were that mission-driven, there’s already been so much organizational turbulence” — he mentioned Altman’s firing and rehiring, OpenAI employees defecting to Anthropic, and governance changes — “that people are less anchored to the institution itself, so it’s easier to poach [from OpenAI] than the other labs.” In lieu of an official comment, OpenAI directed The Verge to a blog post from its global affairs team, which states, “Some eye-popping offers are being extended these days to a handful of terrifically talented researchers, including to folks at OpenAI. Some of these offers are coming with deadlines of just a few hours – literally ‘exploding offers’ – or with restrictions on whether or how they can be discussed.” The blog post goes on to say the company plans to cultivate talent across not just research, but also product, engineering, infrastructure, scaling, and safety. On Wednesday, the company announced it had hired four engineers away from companies like Tesla, xAI, and Meta. Now, OpenAI’s best defense against the losses is its own financial leverage. People that joined OpenAI early on, or even before the end of 2023, have had significant stock appreciation — the unit price jumped from $67 in a May 2023 tender offer to $210 at the end of 2024, according to a source familiar with the situation. And during the end of 2023, around the time of the OpenAI board roller coaster, there was a window in which OpenAI rushed to make hires from other companies who would sign on at the $67-per-unit figure, since there was a near-immediate 2.5x multiplier expected, the source says. With so many companies competing to hire AI talent, there have been high-level departures at many different companies. But even before this most recent hiring frenzy, OpenAI’s employees were being lured elsewhere at a higher-than-average rate. A 2025 SignalFire report analyzed retention patterns in AI and found that Anthropic was best at keeping people around, with 80 percent of employees hired at least two years ago at Anthropic remaining at the company at the conclusion of their second year. DeepMind came next at 78 percent, while OpenAI’s retention rate was markedly lower, at 67 percent — comparable to Meta’s 64 percent. The report, which came out in May before Meta’s Scale deal occurred, also found that engineers were “8 times more likely to leave OpenAI for Anthropic than the reverse,” and 11 times more likely to defect from DeepMind to Anthropic than the reverse. Anthropic was founded by ex-OpenAI research executives with the goal of carefully developing AI technology, describing itself as an “AI safety and research company that’s working to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems.” The company’s “mission-driven safety focus” is a convincing recruitment pitch and a key reason for its low turnover, one source familiar with the situation tells The Verge. “The priorities of the companies become very different, and it’s not something that they’re happy with” “I’ve seen, amongst people who are a little bit more seasoned in industry … they have watched tech as an industry change, and they’ve watched the people in the industry become very different, and the priorities of the companies become very different, and it’s not something that they’re happy with,” says Rumman Chowdhury, a longtime leader in the field of responsible AI at companies like Accenture and Twitter, who now heads up the AI nonprofit Humane Intelligence. When she’s hiring AI engineers, she says, they often say that salary hikes are less important to them than to “not be contributing to a worse world.” AI engineers and researchers can afford that idealism, and concerns about safety and the rush to commercialize the technology have dogged most leading AI companies. At OpenAI, for instance, months of controversy and public pressure about its upcoming transition into a for-profit entity led to the company changing its plans, ceding some control to its nonprofit arm even after the restructuring. The decision followed a public letter written by ex-employees and civic leaders to the California and Delaware attorneys general, with one former employee writing, “OpenAI may one day build technology that could get us all killed.” There are questions, too, about the pace at which Meta is moving and its research priorities. Meta’s Scale AI investment came on the heels of Joelle Pineau’s departure as Meta VP and head of its Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) division, a unit Meta folded into its larger AI efforts after previously describing it as “one of the only groups in the world with all the prerequisites for delivering true breakthroughs with some of the brightest minds in the industry.” Some saw FAIR’s restructuring as a sign that Meta was prioritizing products over research, an industry-wide concern for some AI safety experts. For Meta, however, there are also pragmatic questions about its future in AI. In conversations with The Verge, industry insiders questioned whether Wang is the right choice to head the new lab, since Scale AI does not build frontier models and Wang himself doesn’t have an AI research background. And even Meta executives admit that catching up will be a challenge. During its most recent earnings call in April, Zuckerberg — who called one of Meta’s focuses for 2025 “making Meta AI the leading personal AI” — touched on the competition he was up against. “The pace of progress across the industry and the opportunities ahead for us are staggering. I want to make sure that we’re working aggressively and efficiently, and I also want to make sure that we are building out the leading infrastructure and teams we need to achieve our goals,” he said. Just two months later, that team became Meta’s superintelligence lab. But the AI engineer who steered clear doesn’t regret his decision. “You’re expected to give pretty much your whole self to Meta AI,” he says. The money simply wasn’t good enough for that.

An updated version of the eswap X Pro, this isn't a record low but still a tidy saving on a premium wired gaming controller for Xbox and PC. UK price: £169.39 at Amazon (Elden Ring edition) Maybe the best Xbox-specific gaming headset deal going right now, this the deal to go for if you're after some audio givers for team green's console. UK price: was £129.99 now £89.99 at Amazon If the 2TB card that I've highlighted above is a bit much, then the 1TB alternative might be a better fit - and it's also on offer this Prime Day.

UK price: was £159.99 now £118.74 at Amazon Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the very best Prime Day gaming deals that you can spend your money on right now. We're just over the halfway point of the four-day Prime Day extravaganza, but there's plenty to shout about and dig into so let's do exactly that! I'm going to get the ball rolling with some of my absolute top picks for the best Prime Day gaming deals I've spotted. These are going to be on some of my favorite games that I've played and bits of gear that I've tested - a theme of our overall approach here as my colleagues will be doing the same. We will absolutely still be highlighting discounts and deals more broadly though - there's so much good stuff out there, after all! The first deal I want to highlight is on one of my most favorite bits of gaming gear of the past couple of years. Simply put, the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds are the best gaming earbuds money can buy in my view, and now that they've reached historic low prices as part of the Amazon Prime Day gaming deals, there's literally never been a better time to pick them up. No matter your platform, if you're after some buds, these are the ones to go for. US – SteelSeries Arctis Gamebuds (Black; Xbox): was $199.99 now £147.99 at Amazon UK – SteelSeries Arctis Gamebuds (Black; Xbox): was £159.99 now £118.74 at Amazon However, if you prefer a headset, then let me direct you to the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X which is currently enjoying brillianlty low prices on both sides of the Atlantic. This is one of the best value, and best overall packages of a headset that I can remember testing, and given the superb audio quiality and limitless compatibiltiy of the Nova 5X, this is a no brainer for anyone looking for a headset this Prime Day.US - SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X: was $149.99 now $99.74 at Amazon UK – SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X: was £129.99 now £89.99 at Amazon To take a small diversion from my own personal gaming picks, this one is an absolute belter if you're on Nintendo Switch - especially in the face of Switch 2 stock being hard to find. If you've ever wanted your OG Switch to perform and look a bit better on the big screen, then this is the device you should invest in: the mClassic upscaler. It'll take your low resolution images and bump them up while simultaneously polishing them right up. Simple but very effective. US – Marseille mClassic: was $99.99 now $74.99 at Amazon UK – Marseille mClassic: was £99.99 now £69.88 at Amazon Speaking of adding things to existing setups that make things better, this is something I've recently added to my PS5 Pro setup and have been seriously impressed by: the Creative Sound BlasterX G6 USB sound card. Traditionally, I've always been a wireless-only kind of guy for my setup, but since testing this out and going back to a wired headset for a bit with it, I'm not sure if I can game any other way now. The sound difference and quality the G6 has given me on PS5 is exquisite and has made the audio of Death Stranding something almost otherworldly. What's more, it's now down to a record low price in the UK and a heavily discounted price in the US. Nice. US – Creative Sound BlasterX G6: was $179.99 now $139.99 at Amazon UK – Creative Sound BlasterX G6: was £129.99 now £81.59 at Amazon There's never a bad time to get another controller into your setup as a spare or just to grow or fill out your collection stylishly. As a result, the discounts this Prime Day on Xbox Wireless Controllers are both easy to recommend and worth investing in if you're on the hunt for a new pad. US – Xbox Wireless Controller (Black): was $64.99 now $47.49 at Amazon UK – Xbox Wireless Controller (Black): was £59.99 now £49.99 at Amazon Right, I'm actually stepping away from our live coverage for a bit now leaving you in the capable hands of my gamer colleague Dash. I will be here again tomorrow though, so until then, happy deal hunting! Hello gamers! Dash here to take things over on the live coverage front. I've been trawling the sale for the last few days, so have plenty of bargains to share with you. Sit back, relax, and get ready for some deals. I'm going to start off strong with a personal pick... The Scuf Valor Pro is an excellent controller from a seriously well-regarded brand. It boasts a number of features that make it a perfect fit for Call of Duty games, including adjustable triggers, remappable rear inputs, and in-built audio controls. This is a wired-only model, which might be a shame for some, but comes in at a more affordable price than other Scuf products. At the moment, it's even been discounted down to lowest-ever rate for Prime Day. US - Scuf Valor Pro: was $109.99 now $85.49 at Amazon The Razer Blackshark V2 X is a fantastic gaming headset that comes personally recommended by our Hardware Editor Rhys Wood. It's the headset that he uses every day, as it offers the perfect balance of audio quality, microphone performance, attractive design, and affordability. Right now it's just a few bucks off its lowest-ever price and is a fantastic pick if you're looking for a capable gaming audio device that isn't going to completely empty your wallet - leaving you with some left over cash to spend on even more Prime Day gaming deals! US - Razer BlackShark V2 X: was $59.99 now $36.08 at Amazon UK - Razer BlackShark V2 X: was £41.99 now £32.99 at Amazon Another wired Xbox controller deal here with the Thrustmaster Heart. This unique-looking controller is named after its H.E.A.R.T. anti-drift thumbsticks, which incorporates Hall effect technology for enhanced durability and precision. On top of this, it features two remappable rear buttons, mechanical face buttons, and even a customizable RGB lighting strip right down the middle of the pad. It's currently the lowest-ever price it's been in the UK with a £28.25 discount for Prime Day! UK - Thrustmaster Heart Controller: was £89.99 now £61.74 at Amazon Time for one of my personal Prime Day favorites! Every year we see massive discounts on the fantastic Backbone One mobile controller and the ongoing sale is no exception. If you're after a versatile mobile gamepad, then I would highly recommend it. It's a fantastic all-rounder and the perfect companion if you're planning some travel and need something to keep you entertained in a pinch. Right now the best price is on the PlayStation Edition, which comes in an attractive white colorway and has DualSense Wireless Controller themed buttons. US - Backbone One, Playstation Edition: was $99.99 now $69.99 at Amazon UK - Backbone One, Playstation Edition: was £60 now £40 at Amazon The critically acclaimed Split Fiction has received a massive lowest-ever Prime Day discount and should be in your basket! The co-op action-adventure game came out back in March, so a deal this generous is a real surprise. It received the full five out of five stars from us here at TechRadar Gaming, which is very rare indeed. We loved its innovative mechanics and the seemingly endless variety of different playstyles crammed into the game. It's also visually stunning, pulling off both sci-fi and fantasy settings with impressive fidelity. Just bear in mind that this is a co-op only game before you buy - you can't play it solo in any capacity. Luckily, each copy comes with a handy 'Friend's Pass', which allows you to play with a buddy who doesn't own it at no additional cost US - Split Fiction (PS5): was $49.99 now $35 at Amazon UK - Split Fiction (PS5): was £44.99 now £30.99 at Amazon Okay, this is a bit of a weird one but might be worth checking out if you're using Prime Day as a chance to stock on gifts. Gaming brand HyperX makes a mini headset designed specifically for kids, and it's currently on sale for its lowest-ever price. I had the chance to try it out at Gamescom last year and, while it absolutely didn't fit on my massive gamer head I can attest to its durability. The headset is seriously flexible and didn't so much as creak when I tried my hardest to snap it into pieces in front of the horrified PR representative. Its hard-wearing materials aside, the headset is compatible with all major platforms thanks to the 3.5mm headphone jack and comes in a range of attractive colorways. US - HyperX Cloud Mini Kids: was $29.99 now $19.99 at Amazon Hi there! Josh here, now taking over the live blogging to give Dash a quick break. I've been working behind the scenes all Prime Day writing up deals so I'll be bringing you some of my favorite options from across the sales over the coming hour. So without any further ado... Another bargain PS5 game now and one that's at its lowest price ever in the UK – and not far off in the US. A spiritual successor to the Zoo Tycoon series, Planet Zoo puts you in charge of your own menagerie, allowing you to handcraft your own exquisite animal exhibits filled with everything from Aldabra giant tortoises to western lowland gorillas. Confession time. I'm an enormous PlanZoo addict: I've racked up a truly disgusting 1,200 hours in the game and have no intention of stopping any time soon. Part of what makes the game worth investing your money – and an enormous amount of time – in its the creative freedom it gives you. If you love being able to obsess over details to create your dream zoo, it's a really rewarding experience. It's already offers a huge amount of playtime for a pretty modest spend. And with this deal, that value gets even harder to ignore. US - Planet Zoo (PS5): was $49.99 now $34.99 at Amazon UK - Planet Zoo (PS5): was £39.99 now £19.94 at Amazon If, like me, you were an early Nintendo Switch adopter, you might find your console is getting a little long in the tooth. But if you''re not ready to upgrade to the Switch 2 just yet, you're in luck: one of the best accessories released for the Switch Gen 1 is now available at its lowest ever price. The Nitro Deck is the perfect way to give your handheld a bit of an update. Slot your screen inside it and it'll give you more ergonomic grip and protect your Switch from knocks. But its biggest benefit is it will banish that annoying stick drift with its Hall effect thumbsticks – something I've experienced more times than I'd like the recall. As a gamer of a certain age, I have very fond memories of my GameCube so I particularly love the purple Nitro Deck on offer here, although both the gray and mint colorways are also on offer. US - CRKD Nitro Deck: was $79.99 now $47.99 at Amazon UK - CRKD Nitro Deck: was £59.99 now £47.49 at Amazon Hey everyone! Dash again, back to take over. I'm currently scanning the web for the latest gaming deals, so bear with me for a few moments as I hand-pick the very best ones to share... Right now you can grab the Atari 7800+ at an absolutely incredible 54% off - taking it down to just under $60 at Amazon. For that price you get a fully-featured retro-style games console, plus a controller and an original game cartridge for Bentley Bear's Crystal Quest. On top of this, the console supports original Atari 2600 or 7800 game cartridges, so it could be perfect if you want to grow your own retro collection or have some old games lying around. US - Atari 7800+: was $129.99 now $59.99 at Amazon If you're still using your Nintendo Switch and want to get a little bit Peely with it, then accessory maker PowerA has you covered. This neon yellow carrying case is based on the iconic Fortnite character and even comes with a code for an in-game item. It fits the original Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch OLED, and Nintendo Switch Lite, with built-in storage space for games, small accessories, and even a little padded stand. The current offer is also the lowest price that this model has ever been, though only a few cents. US - PowerA Protection Case for Nintendo Switch (Fortnite Peely): was $22.99 now $12.29 at Amazon We consider the Meta Quest 3S to be one of the very best VR headsets on the market, scoring five stars in our review, where we called it "the only VR headset you need" whether you're completely new to VR or an experienced headset owner. It strikes the perfect balance between performance, practicality, and price. Over Amazon Prime Day, that price tag has got even more tempting, however, with a record discount available right now. In you've been waiting for the chance to dive into the world of VR gaming, you shouldn't pass on this. US - Meta Quest 3S: was $299.99 now $249 at Amazon UK - Meta Quest 3S: was £289 now £237.99 at Amazon Getting into the world doesn't have to be expensive - just look at this affordable microphone from HyperX. The HyperX SoloCast is currently on sale for a lowest-ever price in the UK, with a whopping 30% off. It's rare to see items from trusted brands like this at such low prices. The main reasons to pick the SoloCast is its ease-of-use: this is a simple, plug-and-play microphone that delivers impressive sound right out of the box. The tap-to-mute sensor and adjustable stand are also great inclusions at the price range and make recording or even just chatting with friends a breeze. UK - HyperX SoloCast: was £36.89 now £25.64 at Amazon I've spotted another budget-friendly headset in the Prime Day sales, this time the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 1 - which is down to a new lowest-ever price! Compatible with PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch, it offers plenty of adjustability and a retractable noise-cancelling microphone. Although nothing special the sound is decent for the price. Where this headset really wins, however, is in its comfortable ski-band head strap design and plush ear cushions. UK - SteelSeries Arctis Nova 1: was £59.99 now £31.34 at Amazon This is a US deal that I'm really jealous of. The Special Edition version of the superb Horizon Forbidden West has dropped to its lowest-ever price and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in trying the popular PlayStation series. Set in a futuristic open-world in which you have to survive against vicious, animal-like machines, it's ideal if you're craving a big, meaty experience that will keep you occupied for weeks. Although this is a sequel to Horizon Zero Dawn, no knowledge of that prior game is required to enjoy it. The Special Edition also nets you a SteelBook, mini art book, and a digital soundtrack to enjoy. US - Horizon Forbidden West Special Edition: was $79.99 now $39.99 at Amazon Now this is a bit of a shocker: the PlayStation Portal has received a 10% discount in the UK. That might not sound like much, but it takes it down to a new lowest-ever price and is by far the best PS Portal deal that I've seen yet. The streaming handheld is a popular choice for PS5 owners, letting you play games straight from your console via the internet. It's not quite a PSP replacement, but it can come in clutch when you need to free up the TV for someone else. Its design is excellent too, effectively offering two sides of a DualSense Wireless Controller sandwiched around a screen with all the expected features like rumble, adaptive triggers, and more. Best of all, you don't even need to be a Prime member for this offer! UK - PlayStation Portal: was £199.99 now £179 at Amazon Don't sleep on this incredible Razer Kishi Ultra discount. In my book it's by far the best mobile controller on the market, as long as you don't mind splashing out a bit. It offers an unbeatable level of comfort thanks to its full-size controller grips and offers no shortage of premium features. You get USB-C passthrough charging, full-size thumbsticks, Hall effect triggers, mechanical buttons and a clicky D-pad, and even some customizable RGB lighting strips. Where this mobile controller really leaves the competition in the dust though is its software, which is packed with useful additions including the ability to mimic on-screen commands with buttons to enable compatibility in titles that don't natively support a controller. It's an absolute game-changer for things like League of Legends Wild Rift. US - Razer Kishi Ultra: was $149.99 now $99.99 at Amazon The well-received Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl has crashed down to a record low price for Prime Day. Right now the Xbox version can be yours for a whopping $36.59 off - beating the previous record low by a considerable margin. This post-apocalyptic survival adventure won't be for everyone, but fans of atmospheric and haunting experiences will absolutely love it. It features intense, realistic survival mechanics and a grounded world that's brought to life by modern high-end graphics. US - Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl: was $59.99 now $23.40 at Amazon Interested in a handheld PC? Then you should take a look at this ASUS Rog Ally bargain. The powerful system is currently hovering just 99p above its lowest-ever price at Amazon in the UK, which is an absolutely mega saving. Thanks to AMD's powerful Ryzen Z1 Extreme chip, you'll be able to enjoy a wide range of triple-A games at a 1920x1080 resolution on the crisp 7-inch 120Hz refresh rate screen. In our testing, it achieved an impressive 60 fps in Cyberpunk 2077 after some graphical tweaking, with even better performance for those willing to make use of frame generation. UK - ASUS ROG Ally: was £518.42 now £399.99 at Amazon It just hit midnight here in the UK, which means that we are now officially on our final day of the latest Prime Day sale. If you need a quick recap, the event is running from July 8 to the end of July 11. This means that now is a good time to start pressing the purchase button if you've been stocking your basket, as there's no word on how long any deals could stick around once Prime Day comes to an end. We're also coming up to the final stretch of savings in the US, with less than 34 hours to go. I'm about to head off for the day, but not before I draw your attention to one of the very, very best deals that I've seen so far. The Sony Inzone H3 is a great headset from the PlayStation maker, offering easy plug-and-play compatibility and support for spatial sound. It performs well too, with fantastic audio quality and a flip-to-mute microphone that's ideal for chatting with friends. It's a decent deal at its regular $99.99 price, but this limited time offer knocks over 52% off! That takes it down to under $50, where it absolutely decimates the competition. If you're planning to buy a headset over Prime Day and don't want to spend a lot, then make sure that it's this one. US - Sony Inzone H3: was $99.99 now $48 at Amazon Good morning and welcome to the last day of the Amazon Prime Day gaming deals of 2025. Today marks the last chance to grab something extra for your setup, add a cool game to your backlog on the cheap, or go for that big upgrade you've been considering. We're still seeing some belting discounts across all platforms and devices so use all those links above and we'll continue posting some awesome deals in our live coverage. Starting off with a bang for our UK readers, Amazon has come in clutch and is offering a bona fide 10% discount on the excellent PlayStation Portal handheld device. Deals and discounts have been incredibly hard to come by on the remote play PS5 streaming device, so this is absolutely worth shouting about. I love the Portal too, and it really has given me an extra way to tackle my backlog from the comfort of the sofa, or while away. UK - PlayStation Portal: was £199.99 now £179 at Amazon All the deals at the top of this page are still worth investigating, too, by the way, so definitely get involved with those links to see if you can find your Prime Day gaming deal that will boost your summer.

Title: If I ran X
URL: https://werd.io/if-i-ran-x/
Time Published: 2025-07-10T13:54:17Z
Full Content:
How to transform the internet's most toxic platform into essential infrastructure. “After two incredible years,” Linda Yaccarino tweeted, “I’ve decided to step down as CEO of 𝕏.” It was the day after the company’s AI chatbot, Grok, began calling itself MechaHitler and started spewing antisemitic slurs and advocating for Adolf Hitler in public until the company eventually had to remove them. Many of the users still posting to X greeted the antisemitism warmly; some tweeted, “finally”. No new CEO has been named. I’ve previously written about what I’d do if I ran Bluesky product, Mastodon, my own platform, and a fund supporting the open social web. I’d intended to stop the series there. But as there’s an opening: let’s imagine I was handed the reins to the most toxic mainstream social network. What would I do if I was the new CEO of X? I have some history with the people behind Twitter, the site that eventually became X. I consider multiple people who were there at the site’s inception, as well as many people who worked there in its later years, to be friends; Biz Stone sat on my first startup’s advisory board; I worked for Ev Williams at Medium for a little while. I’ve heard various pieces of founding stories from each of them. And I really loved using Twitter. Long before Elon Musk bought it, I was an addicted user who posted many times a day. It opened up communities for me: I attended Twestivals (and hosted one), saw Ben Walker play his Twitter Song live, took part in countless hashtag games and still own a tote bag I won from the literary magazine Granta for writing a tweet-length horror story. Every time I went to an industry event or a conference, I’d be in the Twitter backchannel, making and reading observations, and building new connections. And then, one day, Elon Musk walked into the building carrying a kitchen sink and began to refashion it around his need to amass power and influence to bring about his edgelord, pronatalist, Hitler-saluting view of the world. The name changed to X, Musk’s original name for PayPal, a company whose board voted to fire him as CEO due to mismanagement. Musk fired 80% of the staff, cratered the morale of the people who remained, reinstated Nazi accounts, hate speech surged — and the rest is history. I’ve been given the reins. I’m CEO now. Can it be saved? Throughout this tumult, X’s active user numbers have remained remarkably steady. 2024’s 335.7M monthly active users represented a 9% drop from 2022, the year Musk acquired Twitter. TechCrunch recently reported that its web views remain vastly higher than new competitors like Threads and Bluesky. Famously, many brands and journalists have been reticent to leave the site, despite its near-constant onslaught of white supremacy and hate speech. In other words: the traffic is there. These users may be a mix of bots, literal Nazis, and people who don’t mind posting on a site that is heavily used by literal Nazis, but there are hundreds of millions of them. So that’s something. On the other hand, its revenue tanked following the acquisition, with some reports showing a drop as big as 66%. More recently, it saw 17.5% growth between 2024 and 2025, but it needs to claw back a lot of ground if it wants to return to its 2021 revenue peak — and even then, it posted a loss for most of the decade that preceded it. In short: its online culture is toxic, its finances are decimated, and morale at the company is through the floor. But there is a great deal of remaining traffic, and many stalwarts have refused to give up followings they spent over a decade building. If we want to turn it around, the only place it’s possible to start is the culture of the company itself. Everything else flows from there. First, let’s address the ketamine in the room: there is no possible cultural turnaround at X while Elon Musk owns the site or has a significant stake. It must be acquired from him. That may seem far-fetched, but much of his wealth is stored in Tesla stock; in a world where his political machinations tank the price of his cash cow, he may need liquidity through other means. X’s valuation had already declined by 80%; his own xAI acquired it at a relative discount. As X’s culture continues to degrade, it may prove to be a drag on the valuation of his AI startup. The benefits of offloading it, in other words, may begin to outweigh the benefits to keeping it. A coalition of hands-on investors would be needed to perform this acquisition, but consider the upside: a de-Nazified Twitter would be worth considerably more than its current incarnation. Musk had previously taken it private; the revived company could once again be floated on the stock market. The potential gains would be significant. A newly-independent X would then be ripe for change. Executives and managers who were loyal to Musk would need to be removed. It’s not a given that other employees were fully on board with his “extremely hardcore”, hard-right ideology: some may have needed to remain to maintain their visas or to ensure a paycheck in a tough hiring environment. Internally, diversity policies and mandatory inclusion training would return. Protections for work-life balance would return, and remote work would once again be allowed, with a staged roll-out. Work would be undertaken to establish an internal culture of empathy, which is a hard requirement for building non-toxic communities; experts like Carole Robin and Vernā Myers would be heavily drawn on for ongoing manager training and culture guidance, and experts like Dr Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru would be drawn on to help the company be mindful the implications of ongoing work. This is the work of years, but the process would begin immediately. To be clear, it’s not that employees would need to be left-wing. This isn’t an inquisition, and a company culture that only allows one political alignment is more harmful than good. But basic human decency would once again be a value: hate speech and bigotry would be explicitly disallowed, and it would be made obvious that the aim of Twitter’s platform is to create a community where voices from a diversity of communities should feel safe to post, which starts with internal cultural expectations. Nazi accounts would need to be banned again, swiftly, with their posts preserved internally in a vault in a de facto legal hold. The messages would be made available as a dataset to organizations that research and investigate hate groups, although users would have the ability to have their content removed in accordance with relevant privacy legislation for their jurisdiction. Significant investments would be made into non-profits and on-the-ground organizations that support the vulnerable communities harmed by the hate speech, doxxing, and other activities previously enabled on X. A commitment would be made for ongoing support: it couldn’t be a one-and-done gesture. A permanent, inclusive trust and safety council would be established, modeled after the Supreme Court, with real, encoded power to affect company policies around content and moderation. This council and its permanence would be defined in the articles of association of the new company; it would be almost impossible to remove them. Its members would be guaranteed a salary (but could not own stock) and required to both adjudicate on content moderation issues and intervene during strategic lapses. The number of members of the council would increase based on active users but could never decrease. Employees who objected to these measures would be free to take a buyout. Some would likely just quit. Meanwhile, the company would begin to aggressively hire across the board, including but not limited to engineering, product, research, design, partnerships, communications, and trust and safety. Public statements and heavy PR would signal the internal cultural changes in order to attract new applicants. The name and brand would be symbolically restored to Twitter, indicating a clean break from the Musk years. It’s a trustworthy brand, and the change back would likely turn heads. But it would be a mistake to simply return the company to its old self. The new Twitter needs to be something else entirely. It’s now clear that Musk’s acquisition was about amassing power, not providing value. As Dan Primack wrote in Axios last year: While this might seem like a selling point to a would-be autocrat, it serves as a weakness to Twitter as a business. Not only does this property make it vulnerable to takeovers from terrible people, but it elevates the company’s business decisions to a level where a mistake could significantly impact democracy or even public safety around the world. (This is also the lesson Meta failed to learn in Myanmar.) In turn, this could subject the company to greater regulatory scrutiny and oversight. It may seem like value at first sight, but it’s actually a business risk. So how can the new Twitter be incredibly valuable but also safer from regulatory oversight? The core value of Twitter is not its social network as such. That’s always been a means to an end. The vast majority of content on the site has historically been created by just 10% of users, but people don’t log in to post: they want to see what other people are saying. The point of Twitter is to find out what’s going on right now and get an insight into the conversation around it. My new Twitter would retain the social network but expand upon the idea that people want to know what’s happening right now. The feed would expand to not just include Twitter’s own conversations, but every public conversation across the social web. Search, trending topics, and live dashboards would represent the entire addressable real-time web, using open standards and protocols like AT Protocol, ActivityPub, and RSS. Twitter would become the way to find out what’s happening everywhere. Some social networks — like Facebook — would not be available via this feed. The addressable social web would consist of sites that embrace open protocols (best), or otherwise make a content deal directly with Twitter (less good). However, a Twitter that aims to provide the pulse of the internet and not necessarily a social network in itself is less of a competitor to closed networks; in fact, the tools may provide new engagement and users for them. The aim would be, over time, to make not being represented on the feed more of a business liability for closed social networking platforms than being included. Twitter would provide libraries, ecosystem support, and even funding for open social web protocols: its value increases as the the social web pie gets bigger. Monetization would be three-prong. Advertising would remain on public feeds, and a renewed focus on trust and safety would improve brand safety, bringing advertising prices back up. Twitter Blue premium profiles on the social network would remain. But most differently, enterprise tools for tracking public sentiment and yielding unique insights from the global conversation would be made available for corporations, media companies, and governments. These tools would also be made available to public research institutions, with some restrictions, for free. Using open protocols should help reduce regulatory risk. In this world, trust and safety is as much about de-listing external content as it is about policing the in-house social network. Aggregating across the entire social web is an enormous infrastructure task that requires real resources and expertise to carry out; the compliance demands across global jurisdictions are complex but fully within Twitter’s wheelhouse. The moat for the business is, in part, the combination of the difficulty of building the tools and their ease of use for end users. In-house expertise would create proprietary machine learning algorithms for sentiment and insight analysis, and integrations with third-party tools like CRMs and analytics platforms could embed the platform in existing enterprise ecosystems. It’s a very similar model to how Google originally became the dominant search engine: simplicity of use combined with the sophistication of its internal technology, all layered over the open web. It’s not even particularly unprecedented: Blaine Cook, then CTO of Twitter, was fired for demonstrating interoperability with Jaiku, another social network. For this new Twitter, interoperability would be core to its value. This transformation wouldn’t happen overnight. A still-aggressive but more realistic timeline might look like: Once established, the new Twitter would set the tone for the social web itself. By implication, it wouldn’t just be the way that conversations were discovered; people would find platforms this way, too. By not hyper-focusing on its own social network, it has the potential to become a much bigger and more valuable company: one that people use to unlock the entire online social conversation. By using open protocols, the company ensures the whole internet isn’t locked into its services, but by caring for trust and safety, design, and the quality of its feeds, it provides best-in-class options for people to choose. And it fosters a bigger, more interesting social web in the process. Does X or Twitter actually need to be saved? Absolutely not. There are plenty of new social networks that are more interesting, more fun to use, and show more promise. But there’s interesting potential here, both to remove a major source of toxicity on the internet, to diffuse a centralized source of power that can be abused by autocrats and oligarchs, and to create a way to elevate the entire social web. So that’s what I would do if I was CEO. Global Majority nations are building ways to store their citizens' data locally. But will they own the datacenters themselves? Tony Stubblebine's account of saving Medium is remarkable in its transparency - and in its execution. "I do not have the time or emotional energy to screen out regular attacks by Large Language Models, with the knowledge that making the wrong decision costs a real human being their connection to a niche community." It's wild to me how many people are still engaging with X. Werd I/O explores the intersection of technology, democracy, and society.

The AI arms race drove NVIDIA to become a $4 trillion company. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. NVIDIA was briefly worth $4 trillion this week. The tech giant passed that milestone and became the first $4 trillion company following a 2.5% increase in stock value at one point on July 9, 2025. The valuation of NVIDIA has since dropped to around $3.97 trillion. NVIDIA began 2025 behind Microsoft and Apple, but steady growth has pushed NVIDIA past other tech giants. Growth is expected to continue for NVIDIA. The company provides computing power for several of the biggest AI tools, which has proven quite lucrative for the GPU maker. NVIDIA's surge to a $4 trillion valuation is due largely to the company's dominance in the AI space. As companies race to integrate AI into everything from computers to personal assistants, the demand for computing power increases. Microsoft, Meta, OpenAI, Google, and other companies release AI-powered products regularly and have integrated AI into existing services. Microsoft was reportedly NVIDIA's largest customer in 2024, outspending Meta, Google, and other tech giants. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. ChatGPT launched in 2022, sparking an AI arms race. NVIDIA's value has increased fifteenfold since OpenAI released its AI-powered tool. "Global demand for Nvidia's AI infrastructure is incredibly strong. AI inference token generation has surged tenfold in just one year, and as AI agents become mainstream, the demand for AI computing will accelerate," said NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang when discussing financial results in May 2025. It was more than an initial surge for NVIDIA. The tech giant reached a $2 trillion valuation in February 2024 and then passed the $3 trillion mark just four months later. NVIDIA's stock price now sits around $163, though that will fluctuate throughout the week. Shares are up about 22% on the year for NVIDIA. NVIDIA stock dipped slightly, dropping the company's value to just under $4 trillion. But given recent trends, it is likely NVIDIA will pass the milestone again. It's more than NVIDIA stock that's risen over the last few years. The company brought in $44.1 billion in revenue in the financial quarter ending in April 2025. That was a 69% year-over-year increase for the tech giant. Sean Endicott is a tech journalist at Windows Central, specializing in Windows, Microsoft software, AI, and PCs.

Title: Forbes Daily: Nvidia Reaches A $4 Trillion Milestone

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. AI juggernaut Nvidia just crossed another milestone: a $4 trillion valuation, the largest in history. The firm, which was worth just over $10 billion a decade ago, now outranks household names like Microsoft, Apple and Amazon, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard in training advanced artificial intelligence programs. It’s hard to grasp just how much money $4 trillion is, but for some context: The company of less than 40,000 people is now worth more than 97% of the world’s economies, the entire New York area real estate market and the combined net worth of the 30 richest people in the world. Linda Yaccarino X CEO Linda Yaccarino announced her resignation Wednesday, just one day after Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok made a series of antisemitic comments on the social media platform—though a source told NBC News that the exit has been in the works for over a week. On X, Musk wrote: “Thank you for your contributions,” in response to the former advertising executive’s departure after a two-year stint leading the company. It’s unclear who will succeed her. MORE: Later Wednesday night, xAI launched the latest and most advanced version of its AI model: Grok 4. In a nearly hour-long livestream, Musk and xAI staffers demoed the new model, which Musk said was “smarter than almost all graduate students in all disciplines, simultaneously.” The billionaire did not address Grok’s recent controversial posts. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell Good news for investors eagerly awaiting lower borrowing costs: Most Federal Reserve officials still expect interest rate cuts this year, according to minutes released from its recent meeting, but tariffs could complicate the Fed’s efforts to fight price increases. Still, many members of the central bank’s rate-setting panel noted that the inflationary impacts of tariffs could be more limited if trade deals are reached soon. As President Donald Trump suggested he’d implement a 50% tariff on copper imports, the price of the metal skyrocketed in its largest intraday surge since the 1980s, before paring back some of its gains Wednesday. The levies would likely increase prices for copper in the U.S., analysts predicted, as just over half of the total refined copper consumed in the U.S. is imported. MORE: Higher copper costs could also lead to an increase in crime, as the metal would become a valuable target for thieves. It’s the third-most consumed metal in the U.S., with uses ranging from electrical wiring in buildings to computers and cars, and is often stolen from construction sites. Critics of President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” argue that it takes from the poor to benefit the wealthy, but not all billionaires are celebrating its passage. Some of the bill’s measures are more likely to help multi-millionaires than billionaires, and a number of the world’s richest people are concerned about the expected $3.4 trillion that will be added to the deficit by 2034 as a result of the legislation. One estate planning attorney told Forbes some of his billionaire clients are moving more of their wealth offshore to “more stable economies.” Adam Valkin, who helped grow General Catalyst into a global venture capital powerhouse, wants to help Israeli founders break into the U.S. market in his new role at Vine Ventures. Valkin will help the firm invest in the country known as “Startup Nation,” as—despite experiencing a drop in investments after the October 7 attack—Israeli startups have raised $3.1 billion so far in 2025. After Shaun Maguire of Sequoia Capital received swift backlash for his comments about New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, a letter supporting the venture capital firm partner garnered hundreds of signatures. The letter defending Maguire claims his remarks, including accusing Mamdani of being an “Islamist,” did not constitute hate speech, even as nearly 1,000 tech founders demanded Sequoia take disciplinary action. Carlo Ancelotti Former Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti has been sentenced to one year in prison and will pay a hefty fine after being found guilty of tax fraud. He had been accused of failing to pay over $1.1 million in Spanish taxes related to image rights. Managing Real Madrid is a big deal in the world of professional sports—the team topped Forbes’ list of The World’s Most Valuable Soccer Teams in 2025, the fourth year in a row it ranked No. 1. Billionaire Bill Ackman’s wildcard entry into the Hall of Fame Open tennis tournament ended in swift defeat Wednesday, drawing criticism from fans and officials who questioned whether the hedge fund manager had earned his spot in the professional event. Participants in the tournament are typically selected based on ATP rankings, wildcard entries and qualifiers. Randy Walker, the director for the Vero Beach Futures tennis tournament, posted on X after the match: “I just watched the absolute worst professional tennis match I have ever seen.” Photo by Matt Roth for The Washington Post via Getty Images Even as child care remains a major hurdle for many working parents, few companies are taking advantage of a federal tax break given to firms that provide child care for their employees, according to IRS data. But the just-signed tax and budget bill includes a little-known provision that more than triples the Employer-Provided Childcare Tax Credit, and data shows that child care benefits are helping companies’ bottom lines. Les Wexner Five years ago, Ohio’s most revered entrepreneur Les Wexner stepped down as chairman of L Brands and soon began to sell off his stake in the Victoria’s Secret parent company amid controversy over his close relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Many believed that Wexner, then age 82, would quietly retire. Instead, the fashion mogul has more than doubled his fortune thanks in large part to some savvy bets in a different industry: technology. Over just the past three months, his net worth—which includes assets held in his children’s and wife Abigail’s names—has soared to $10.1 billion from $7.9 billion, according to Forbes’ estimates. The biggest driver of this increase: a 4% stake in CoreWeave, one of the buzziest artificial intelligence companies. On Monday, CoreWeave announced it is buying crypto miner Core Scientific in a roughly $9 billion all-stock deal. CoreWeave’s market capitalization has almost tripled since its March IPO to nearly $73 billion today, and Wexner’s stake is now worth $2.8 billion. The eight-year-old CoreWeave helps companies build data centers and loans out cloud access to much-sought-after graphics processing units, or GPUs, which firms like Microsoft, IBM and Meta pay to use to build AI models. With no shortage of customers, the company recorded $982 million in revenue during the first quarter of this year, a 420% increase versus the same quarter last year. However, it’s yet to turn a profit and reported a net loss of $315 million during the same period. WHY IT MATTERS “After originally making a fortune in fashion, Wexner has become one of the biggest (and most unlikely) winners of the AI gold rush,” says Forbes staff writer Jemima McEvoy. “In addition to becoming an early backer of the $73 billion (market cap) CoreWeave, one of the buzziest AI companies around, Wexner's real estate development firm has played a crucial role in bringing big tech players like Meta, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Intel to Central Ohio.” MORE How Victoria’s Secret Billionaire Owner Accidentally Scored A $800 Million Stake In An AI Unicorn Millions of borrowers will soon be on the hook for thousands of extra dollars as the Trump Administration is slated to start charging interest next month on student loans under the Biden-era SAVE plan. Borrowers enrolled in the plan have had their loans in forbearance since last summer while it’s been held up in court: About 7.84 million: The number of borrowers with loans under the SAVE plan that will be affected by the change $3,500: The amount in additional interest per year that the average borrower enrolled in the SAVE plan will be charged, which works out to about $300 per month 1.5 million: How many applicants for income-driven repayment plans were yet to be processed, the Education Department said in a June court filing Many employees have experienced “quiet firing,” where a manager makes a work environment so unpleasant that it pushes people to quit. Sometimes quiet firing occurs because a boss isn’t doing their job, or it could just be part of the company culture—it’s an easier way for firms to reduce headcount without very public layoffs. If you’ve been silently pushed out, try not to take it personally: You deserve a workplace that supports your growth.

Title: Nvidia breaks market value record of $4 trillion

The silicon valley chip maker briefly topped a record-breaking $4 trillion valuation. Nvidia has seen a consistent rise over the past two years, as enthusiasm for AI-powered tech continues. Shortly after the US stock market opened on Wednesday morning, Nvidia's stock price surged to $164.42. This pushed it briefly to a valuation of $4 trillion, a market value greater than the GDP of France, the UK, or India. The success at the Californian chip company has been helping the wider stock market recover after a downturn in April, partly prompted by US President Donald Trump announcing widespread tariffs. Trump's ongoing trade war sent global markets plummeting. Nvidia, led by Taiwan-born Jensen Huang, has seen a consistent rise over the past two years as this enthusiasm over AI has boomed. Many big tech companies such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta, have also joined the multi-billion dollar AI race. "The market has an incredible certainty that AI is the future," Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers told AFP news agency. "Nvidia is certainly the company most positioned to benefit from that gold rush." In early 2025, Nvidia and generative AI such as OpenAI were challenged by the arrival of China-based DeepSeek. DeepSeek disrupted the AI world with a low-cost, high-performance model. Nvidia lost some $600 billion in market valuation in a single trading session at that time. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video After Trump's tariffs hit the tech sector hard in April, Nvidia quickly bounced back. In the most recent quarter, Nvidia reported earnings of nearly $19 billion despite a $4.5 billion hit from US government export controls which limit chip sales to China. In May, the company reached a deal to build AI infrastructure in Saudi Arabia, during a Trump state visit. "We've seen the administration using Nvidia chips as a bargaining chip," said Angelo Zino, technology analyst at CFRA Research. Even as Trump has announced new tariffs in recent days, US stocks have remained high, with the tech-centered Nasdaq closing at a new record on Wednesday. Shares in Nvidia closed on Wednesday with a market value of $3.972 trillion. Edited by: Elizabeth Schumacher
