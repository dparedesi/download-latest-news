Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp after a judge ruled that the company does not hold a monopoly in social networking. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his ruling Tuesday after the historic antitrust trial wrapped up in late May. His decision follows two separate rulings that branded Google an illegal monopoly in both search and online advertising, dealing yet another regulatory blow to the tech industry that for years enjoyed nearly unbridled growth. The Federal Trade Commission “continues to insist that Meta competes with the same old rivals it has for the last decade, that the company holds a monopoly among that small set, and that it maintained that monopoly through anticompetitive acquisitions,” Boasberg wrote in his ruling. “Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now. The Court’s verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so.” Meta, the FTC had argued, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s strategy, “expressed in 2008: ‘It is better to buy than compete.’ True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.” During his April testimony, Zuckerberg pushed back against the FTC’s contention that Facebook bought Instagram to neutralize a threat. In his line of questioning, FTC attorney Daniel Matheson repeatedly brought up emails — many of them more than a decade old — written by Zuckerberg and his associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram. While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn’t capture the full scope of his interest in the company. The FTC’s complaint said Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and “neutralize perceived competitive threats,” just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers. The social media landscape has changed so much since the FTC filed its lawsuit in 2020, Boasberg wrote, that each time the court examined Meta’s apps and competition, they changed. Two opinions to dismiss the case — filed in 2021 and 2022 — didn’t even mention popular social video platform TikTok. Today, it “holds center stage as Meta’s fiercest rival.” Quoting the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, “that no man can ever step into the same river twice,” Boasberg said the same is true for the online world of social media as well. “The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly. While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down,” he wrote. Facebook bought Instagram — then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following — in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal’s value fell to $750 million after Facebook’s stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012. Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller “acqui-hires” — a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion. WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta’s competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple’s messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta did not immediately respond to a message for comment.

Watch CBS News November 18, 2025 / 3:05 PM EST / AP Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp after a judge ruled that the company does not hold a monopoly in social networking. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his ruling Tuesday after the historic antitrust trial wrapped up in late May. His decision follows two separate rulings that branded Google an illegal monopoly in both search and online advertising, dealing yet another regulatory blow to the tech industry that for years enjoyed nearly unbridled growth. The Federal Trade Commission "continues to insist that Meta competes with the same old rivals it has for the last decade, that the company holds a monopoly among that small set, and that it maintained that monopoly through anticompetitive acquisitions," Boasberg wrote in his ruling. "Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now. The Court's verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so." Meta Platforms Inc., the FTC had argued, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, "expressed in 2008: 'It is better to buy than compete.' True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats." During his April testimony, Zuckerberg pushed back against the FTC's contention that Facebook bought Instagram to neutralize a threat. In his line of questioning, FTC attorney Daniel Matheson repeatedly brought up emails — many of them more than a decade old — written by Zuckerberg and his associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram. While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn't capture the full scope of his interest in the company. But the case was not about the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago, which the FTC approved at the time, but about whether Meta holds a monopoly now. The FTC, Boasberg wrote in the ruling, could only win if it proved "current or imminent legal violation." The FTC's complaint said Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and "neutralize perceived competitive threats," just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers. Meta said Tuesday's decision "recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition." "Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth. We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America," the Menlo Park, California-based company said in a statement. The social media landscape has changed so much since the FTC filed its lawsuit in 2020, Boasberg wrote, that each time the court examined Meta's apps and competition, they changed. Two opinions to dismiss the case — filed in 2021 and 2022 — didn't even mention popular social video platform TikTok. Today, it "holds center stage as Meta's fiercest rival." Quoting the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, "that no man can ever step into the same river twice," Boasberg said the same is true for the online world of social media as well. "The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly. While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down," he wrote. Emarketer analyst Minda Smiley said Meta's win "is not necessarily surprising considering the lengths it's gone to in recent years to keep up with TikTok." "But from a regulatory standpoint, Meta is far from out of the woods: next year, major social networks will face landmark trials in the US regarding children's mental health," she added. "Still, today's win is surely a boost for the company as it battles criticism and questions over how its massive AI spending will ultimately benefit Meta in the long run." Facebook bought Instagram — then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following — in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp after a judge ruled that the company does not hold a monopoly in social networking. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his ruling Tuesday after the historic antitrust trial wrapped up in late May. His decision runs in sharp contrast to two separate rulings that branded Google an illegal monopoly in both search and online advertising, dealing regulatory blows to the tech industry that for years enjoyed nearly unbridled growth. The Federal Trade Commission “continues to insist that Meta competes with the same old rivals it has for the last decade, that the company holds a monopoly among that small set, and that it maintained that monopoly through anticompetitive acquisitions,” Boasberg wrote in his ruling. “Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now. The Court’s verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so.” The federal agency had argued that Meta maintained a monopoly by pursuing an expression CEO Mark Zuckerberg made in 2008: “‘It is better to buy than compete.’ True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.” During his April testimony, Zuckerberg pushed back against claims that Facebook bought Instagram to neutralize a threat. In his line of questioning, FTC attorney Daniel Matheson repeatedly brought up emails — many of them more than a decade old — written by Zuckerberg and his associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram.

The Federal Trade Commission “continues to insist that Meta competes with the same old rivals it has for the last decade, that the company holds a monopoly among that small set, and that it maintained that monopoly through anticompetitive acquisitions,” Boasberg wrote in his ruling. “Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now. The Court’s verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so.” Meta, the FTC had argued, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s strategy, “expressed in 2008: ‘It is better to buy than compete.’ True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.” During his April testimony, Zuckerberg pushed back against the FTC’s contention that Facebook bought Instagram to neutralize a threat. In his line of questioning, FTC attorney Daniel Matheson repeatedly brought up emails — many of them more than a decade old — written by Zuckerberg and his associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram. While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn’t capture the full scope of his interest in the company. The FTC’s complaint said Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and “neutralize perceived competitive threats,” just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers. The social media landscape has changed so much since the FTC filed its lawsuit in 2020, Boasberg wrote, that each time the court examined Meta's apps and competition, they changed. Two opinions to dismiss the case — filed in 2021 and 2022 — didn't even mention popular social video platform TikTok. Today, it “holds center stage as Meta's fiercest rival.” Quoting the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, “that no man can ever step into the same river twice,” Boasberg said the same is true for the online world of social media as well. “The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly. While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down,” he wrote. Facebook bought Instagram — then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following — in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal’s value fell to $750 million after Facebook’s stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012. Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller “acqui-hires” — a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion. WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta’s competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple’s messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta did not immediately respond to a message for comment.

Title: Dow plunges 500 points on fears of AI bubble, waning hope for Fed rate cut

The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged nearly 500 points, or 1.1%, Tuesday as fears over an AI bubble shook the market and traders fretted that rate cuts from the Federal Reserve aren’t a sure thing. It was fourth straight decline for the blue-chip index and the S&P 500, which dipped 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq slid 1.2% as investors panicked over whether AI firms have been overvalued – extending a rocky tech rout into its third week. Shares in Nvidia fell nearly 3%. The chipmaker is reporting its third-quarter results on Wednesday, toward the end of an especially upbeat earnings season. But “Magnificent 7” tech stocks have dropped amid fears that AI enthusiasm is reminiscent of the “dot-com bubble” of the 1990s and early 2000s. Amazon, Microsoft and Meta also fell. “All technology revolutions create bubble-like stock price performance – but this bubble is still inflating at a healthy pace with no signs of popping anytime soon,” James Denmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research, said in a note Tuesday. “Valuations, while expensive, still trade at discounts to earnings growth rates and overall AI market sentiment is mildly bullish and not euphoric.” Sign up to receive On The Money by Charlie Gasparino in your inbox every Thursday.

Odds of a quarter-point cut at the Fed’s December meeting plunged to just over 50% – down from more than 90% this time last month, according to CME FedWatch, which tracks Fed Funds futures prices. Investors are looking ahead to the release of Fed minutes on Wednesday. The September jobs report, which was delayed by the government shutdown, is due out Thursday. Despite the upcoming data releases, which are key to the Fed’s decision-making process, several officials have continued to advocate for a slower rate-cutting pace. That has spooked investors who are eager for low interest rates – sending gold futures down 0.3% to $4,062 for its fourth straight day of declines. Meanwhile, Anthropic on Tuesday announced plans to buy $30 billion of Azure compute capacity from Microsoft as part of a new strategic deal. Microsoft will invest $5 billion into Anthropic, and Nvidia will give $10 billion to the startup as part of the deal. While massive AI partnerships would usually send stocks soaring, both Microsoft and Nvidia saw big losses. Anthropic is a private company. Further adding to fears of an AI bubble, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai told BBC on Tuesday that there is some “irrationality” in the current AI boom. In the case of an AI bubble bursting, “I think no company is going to be immune, including us,” Pichai said. Bitcoin dropped briefly below $90,000 on Tuesday. Many tech investors with substantial AI holdings also own cryptocurrency. By about 12:52 p.m., the cryptocurrency jumped 1.3% to $93,249.46. Shares in Home Depot plummeted 6% after the company cut its full-year profit forecast and missed earnings estimates as inflation-battered consumers hold off on renovations. While a November pullback is unusual, it could set up the stock market for a strong December and end to the year, Denmert said in his note. In the previous trading session, the 30-stock Dow fell more than 550 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each dropped about 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq appears on track to break its seven-month streak of gains. Advertisement

Title: Google Says New Gemini 3 AI Model Will Better Understand Your Requests

Gemini 3 is available to all users in the Gemini app, along with powering AI Mode in Google Search. Google Gemini 3 Gemini 3, the latest AI model from Google, is the company's most intelligent model to date, with more advanced multimodal and vibe coding capabilities, the company said in a blog post on Tuesday. It's available now. Google says Gemini 3 is "built to grasp depth and nuance" and is better at understanding the intent behind a user's request. The company also touted Gemini 3's multimodal capabilities, such as its ability to turn a long video lecture into interactive flash cards or to analyze a person's pickleball match and find areas for improvement. Gemini 3 isn't limited to the app. It'll also be available in AI Mode in Search and, for Pro and Ultra subscribers, in AI Overviews. In AI Overviews, Gemini 3 can generate interactive elements. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis and Koray Kavukcuoglu said in a blog post that Gemini 3 Pro is less sycophantic, a problem that's been plaguing AIs and leading to AI psychosis in some. It's also more secure against prompt injection attacks, in which bad actors try to make an AI ignore its original instructions and perform unintended actions. The company also unveiled Google Antigravity, a new agentic development platform. Google says Antigravity is like having an active partner while making tools or working on projects, autonomously planning and executing complex software tasks while validating its own code. It works in tandem with Gemini 2.5's Computer Use model for browser control and works with nano banana, Gemini 2.5's image model. Gemini 3's new, more powerful, agentic capabilities will only be available to $250/month Google AI Ultra subscribers at first. This will allow the Gemini Agent to do multi-step workflows, like planning a travel itinerary. Read more: AI Essentials: 29 Ways You Can Make Gen AI Work for You, According to Our Experts Google's release of Gemini 3 comes as an AI war is heating up between it, OpenAI, Anthropic and xAI. Google's consistently been leading AI leaderboards, although other AI models haven't been far behind, sometimes trading spots at the top. With the release of Gemini 3, Google seems to be trying to solve for some of AI's more annoying problems, like hallucinations or sycophancy. It's also trying to prove that AIs can be truly agentic, being able to accomplish tasks on the user's behalf. Other agentic models have proven to be problematic in real-world usage and run into various security concerns, especially in web browsers. The latest AI release from Google also comes at a time when there are fears of an AI bubble forming in the stock market. AI companies, including Nvidia, Google, Meta and Microsoft, account for 30% of the S&P 500. Google currently has a valuation of $3.4 trillion. Even Google CEO Sundar Pichai says the trillion-dollar AI investment boom has "elements of irrationality" and that a burst would affect every AI company, he said in an interview with the BBC. Still, if Google is to keep its stock price moving upward, it needs to demonstrate that its AI models beat the competition. AI exists in Google Search currently in two ways: via AI Overviews and through AI Mode. AI Overviews is the window that appears under your search query, where a smaller AI model attempts to quickly answer your questions. AI Overviews is a separate tab in Search, alongside Images, Shopping, News and Videos that runs a more advanced model allowing users to converse with it. It's like using Gemini, but without having to go to the main Gemini website. As of now, Gemini 3 is in AI Mode, but only for those who pay for a Google AI Pro or Ultra subscription. Gemini 3 enhancements are also available in AI Overviews, but only for subscribers. Gemini 3 Pro is available in AI Mode for subscribers as well. In AI Mode, Google is touting Gemini's ability to take existing information and create bespoke UI elements. This magazine-style view will incorporate interactable widgets, images and videos. For example, if researching mortgages, Gemini can create a custom calculator to help you compare terms and savings options. Google Search uses a "fan-out" technique to pull information from across the web. With Gemini 3's advanced reasoning, Google says Search can uncover more information on the web and intelligently understand your intent.

Title: I finally went for it and bought unsupported prescription lenses for my Oakley Meta HSTN and Vanguard smart glasses so you don't have to. From ordering installation, here's how my experience went

Turns out, Meta's AI glasses work just fine with high-strength prescription lenses. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Of all the emerging form factors for AI, smart glasses appear to be the most promising. Many of us already wear some form of glasses daily, whether those are prescription glasses, blue-light blocking glasses, or sunglasses. Embedding smart features and AI into a product that is already a huge part of our lives sounds like a recipe for success. There's just one problem — prescription glasses-wearers, despite being likely to benefit the most from having AI on their face, are usually left out. To me, Meta makes the best smart glasses on the market, and they're ready for primetime. So, I took a leap. I spent over $500 on third-party prescription lenses for my Oakley Meta HSTN and Vanguard. Here's what it was like customizing Oakley Meta smart glasses with unsupported prescription lenses. I've worn prescription Oakley glasses and sunglasses for half a decade now, and I was excited when Meta announced it was bringing its smart glasses to Oakley frames. Unfortunately, the Oakley Meta HSTN didn't officially support my prescription, and the Oakley Meta Vanguard is not offered with prescription lenses. I wasn't about to give up, so I searched for third-party companies willing to make prescription lenses for Oakley Meta glasses. After months of research, I placed my first order with Lensology, a U.K. lens crafter that specializes in "click and fit" service for Meta glasses. I ordered a pretty specific lens configuration due to my prescription strength, and the color matched my Meta HSTN frames in the "Warm Gray" colorway. The ordering process with Lensology was easy, and the company takes care of all import charges, so you aren't hit with a bill when they arrive. The wait, however, was a bit lengthy. It took approximately two weeks for Lensology to manufacture my lenses, as the configuration I chose was non-stock. Then, the U.S. FDA spot-checked my lenses during the import process, further delaying them. I was told this was Lensology's first-ever FDA spot check (what luck!), and the company's customer service was responsive and helpful. Really, the delay was out of Lensology's control, and my lenses arrived roughly within a month of placing my order despite the snag. To make things right, Lensology sent another set of lenses free of charge, which passed customs immediately, confirming that this was just a fluke. I then searched for a way to wear prescription lenses with the Oakley Meta Vanguard and stumbled upon SVED Optical. The company manufactures prescription inserts for various types of sports glasses and goggles, and indeed, they have one for Vanguard. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android The experience ordering from SVED was exceptional for a few reasons. The company is based in the U.S., which simply makes things easier for a stateside buyer. The Vanguard inserts were also significantly cheaper, costing only $164 (even less with an email discount). They slot in behind the Vanguard's built-in Oakley Prizm sunglass lenses, which makes them more affordable. SVED delivered my Oakley Meta Vanguard inserts 12 days after I placed my order. That turnaround time is good enough to rival official Meta/Oakley handling speeds, if it sold Vanguard prescription lenses. I try to order straight from LensCrafters, the EssilorLuxottica-owned company Meta partners with for smart glasses, whenever possible. It costs more, but the return policy and warranties are exceptional. I like being able to walk into a store and get my situation handled immediately, and not having that with Lensology or SVED was a risk. To their credit, both brands accept mail-in returns within 30 days. When each order arrived, the quality and insertion process left me with no complaints. Putting the SVED inserts into the Meta Vanguard is so simple that anyone can do it. You remove the stock Vanguard nose piece and slip the SVED inserts into place. The prescription lenses are attached to a new nosepiece, which secures them to the Vanguard frame. I was skeptical about the added weight and how my prescription Vanguard setup would feel on my face. Surely, the lenses would rattle and scratch against the stock sunglass lenses, right? Between daily use and a 5K run, I was pleased to find that none of these were noticeable issues. The process was trickier for the Meta HSTN glasses, because you have to physically remove the stock lenses and push the prescription ones in their place. It'll be a harder process the thicker the prescription lenses. Lensology has a great instructional video on YouTube, though, and the company even records a test fit from their factory that validates the lenses fit in HSTN frames. If you have any experience changing out prescription lenses, the process is easy. Even if you don't, you'll get the hang of it quickly. The secret is to push really hard — you might think the glasses will break, but it's a necessary part of the process. Meta's AI glasses are already pricey, but adding prescription lenses through a third-party company further increases the cost of entry. There's inherent risk, even with reputable companies. You might be left at a loss if you get buyer's remorse and need to pay to ship the custom lenses back through the return process. That's why, after months of indecision, I gave SVED and Lensology a shot so you don't have to take that risk. I recommend both SVED and Lensology, and I ordered lenses from each with my own cash. If you can only pick one, I'd go with the Vanguard inserts. The cheaper price means you won't be in trouble if your prescription changes and you need a new set. On the other hand, the SVED and Vanguard combo isn't feasible for use indoors or at night. If you need clear or Transitions lenses, the Lensology and HSTN setup is the way to go. Now that I've gone through the process of putting unsupported prescription lenses in Oakley Meta HSTN and Vanguard, I think anyone on the fence should do the same. It's worth it because Meta glasses are a game-changer, and everyone should get to experience them. The best AI glasses Oakley Meta Vanguard are the best smart glasses on the market with an IP67 durability rating, a louder speaker, and a central 3K video camera. Garmin and Strava integration are the icing on the cake for fitness buffs. The standard retail versions of the Oakley Meta glasses are not typically sold with prescription lenses installed by default. While you can purchase prescription lenses for the Meta HSTN glasses, they only fall within a certain range. The Vanguard glasses do not officially support prescription lenses. The Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses support a prescription range of -6.00 to +4.00, which is the same range offered by the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2. You'll first have to remove the original lenses by pushing them out from the back of the frame. You may have to push quite hard for them to pop out. Afterwards, you snap on the new lenses by pushing them into the from from the front. You must remove the nose piece from the Vanguard and replace it with the SVED nose piece insert with the lenses attached. The prescription lenses will be placed behind the Vanguard sunglass lenses.

Yours truly is overdue on an overview how private-debt-backed AI datacenter deals work and why companies like Meta who are perfectly capable of borrowing in their own name paying 200-300 basis points extra not to do so is not a good sign. But the Wall Street Journal just published a very detailed story on the general outlines of this debt binge, which has gotten more attention in the popular press as borrowing levels have skyrocketed this year: Big Tech borrowing for AI data centers: 2015-2024 average: $32B/year Sept-Oct 2025 alone: $75B > Meta borrowed $30B > Oracle borrowed$18B > $META also did $27B off-balance sheet with Blue Owl AI companies now 14% of IG index The “money-printing” tech companies are…… pic.twitter.com/IuhBU0LS4M — junkbondinvestor (@junkbondinvest) November 5, 2025 And from the new Wall Street Journal story: What the Journal calls a “frenzy” in Wall Street Blows Past Bubble Worries to Supercharge AI Spending Frenzy is awfully reminiscent of the toxic phase of the subprime lending binge, when originators were so desperate for product, as the jibe then went, they’d fund borrower who could fog a mirror. It was years later that we were able, with the key elements including some insiders plus a remarkable pre-crisis analysis by (of all things) an equity market analyst, Henry Maxey of Ruffler Investment, to piece together how leverage-on-leverage created an even-then, well-reported “wall of liquidity”. It was also the leverage on leverage (and that systemically important yet fragile financial institutions were heavily exposed) that made the bubble unwind so catastrophic. We have warned that the unwind of an, erm, traditional credit bubble, even if very large (see Japan and for a lesser but still nasty version, the S&L crisis) typically produces at worst very deep and protracted recessions and zombification (the runup to the 1929 US crash also featured CDO-like leverage on leverage, see Frank Partnoy’s The Match King for details), as opposed to banking system near-or-actual failures. So again, we have yet to see evidence of that meteor-hitting-the-financial-system event being in the offing. But absence of evidence does not amount to evidence of absence. And perhaps finance historians can correct me, but I do not recall a historical instance of a massive equity bubble (without 1929-style heavy borrowings directly against those equities) accompanied by so many red flags, particularly operating and financial leverage, in the underlying commercial activity. That included recursive deals among key companies and as we’ll discuss a bit in this and more in posts to come, overly-clever borrowing structures that make sense only to achieve higher levels of leverage than could be achieved by traditional means. The Journal points out in passing that one of the mega-deals will pay more than 2% that a plainer-vanilla offering would. In a fine overview of in June on how these financings work, Paul Kedrosky similarly said the premium was 200 to 300 basis points. That’s an awful lot to pay for opacity and supposed balance sheet remoteness.1 As a brief introduction to causes for concern about the datacenter boom, see the executive summary from Bubble or Nothing from the Center for Public Enterprise (hat tip Matt Stoller): ● Cash flow uncertainty persists as the cost of providing AI inference services continues to rise. Leading AI inference service providers are not particularly differentiated from one another; this competitive market structure suppresses market participants’ pricing power and prevents them from recovering rising costs. ● The collateral value of a graphical processing unit (GPU), the sector’s keystone asset, looks poised to fall in the near-term. The value of chips fluctuates depending on uncertain user demand as well as the supply dynamics and technical specifications of new GPUs, now released yearly. The cash flow that GPU collateral can demand is suppressed due to the sector’s competitive market structure and the uncertain depreciation schedule of existing GPUs. ● Data center tenants will undertake multiple cycles of intense and increasingly expensive capital expenditure within a single lease term, posing considerable tenant churn risks to data center developers. This asset-liability mismatch between data center developers and their tenants will strain developers’ creditworthiness without guarantees from market-leading tech companies. ● Circular financing, or “roundabouting,” among so-called hyperscaler tenants—the leading tech companies and AI service providers—create an interlocking liability structure across the sector. These tenants comprise an incredibly large share of the market and are financing each others’ expansion, creating concentration risks for lenders and shareholders. ● Debt is playing an increasingly large role in the financing of data centers. While debt is a quotidian aspect of project finance, and while it seems like hyperscaler tech companies can self-finance their growth through equity and cash, the lack of transparency in some recent debt-financed transactions and the interlocked liability structure of the sector are cause for concern. The first two points alone, the fact that inference costs are not only not falling but still rising, and near-term downside in GPU prices ought to be fatal, or at least detrimental to debt funding. Yet as you’ll see, even though the Journal raises concerns, and even adds to this list by describing how AI “hyperscalers” are putting out duplicate orders for the datacenter capacity, virtually assuring whipsaw, it’s not as sobering as the list above. But it includes signs that some dogs are turning their noses up at the dogfood: Stock prices normally go up when a company reports record revenue but after Meta did just that on Oct. 29, its shares plummeted 11% instead. The reason: Zuckerberg disclosed he will “aggressively” increase capital spending on AI, drawing questions from analysts about how the company plans to actually make money off the new technology. What the Journal describes parallels the late-stage subprime lending frenzy. In 2007, CEO Chuck Prince of later-big-bailout recipient Citigroup famously remarked: When the music stops, in terms of liquidity, things will be complicated. “But as long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance. We’re still dancing….The depth of the pools of liquidity is so much larger than it used to be that a disruptive event now needs to be much more disruptive than it used to be. Consider from the Journal the, erm, enthusiasm of lenders and fears of becoming wall flowers in this party: Silicon Valley’s biggest players are flush with cash and were able to fund much of the initial AI build-out from their own coffers. As the dollar figures climb ever higher, they are turning to debt and private equity—spreading the risks and potential rewards more broadly across the economy. Some of the financing is coming from plain-vanilla corporate bond sales, but financiers are making far bigger fees off giant private deals. Virtually every Wall Street player is angling to get a piece of the action, from banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley to traditional asset managers such as BlackRock. Investor appetite for data-center debt is so strong that some money managers have booked billion-dollar gains in a matter of days, even before construction of the facilities they are financing is complete. Still, the longer-term performance is hardly assured. Big tech companies are expected to spend nearly $3 trillion on AI through 2028 but only generate enough cash to cover half that tab, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley. Big names in the financial world, such as Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, are warning about AI-fueled froth in the markets and in capital spending. At the same time, the fear of missing out is real. Days after Solomon voiced his concerns to analysts, Goldman formed a new team in its banking and markets group focused on AI infrastructure financing. Later from the Journal: Funds that invest in AI deals say they carry little risk, because tech companies with deep pockets have ironclad leases that will generate the money to pay investors back. Microsoft has a higher credit rating than the U.S. government, and it told investors on Oct. 29 that it would double its total data-center footprint in the next two years. Perhaps I am too old, but I recall that IBM and GE were once AAA rated too, and that by 2000 (for IBM) and 2010 (for GE) their luster had taken quite a turn. And remember the pre-crisis pattern that housing prices had never fallen nationwide, only regionally? These supposedly blue-chip tech companies are placing monster bets on AI, so their historical solidity isn’t as germane as it might seem, unless they back off if the fundamental performance of large language models continues to fall well short of promises. The reaction of the Meta stockholders to Zuckerberg’s promise of even more big AI spending is confirmation. Back to the Journal: Tech executives see more risk in underbuilding than overbuilding… But some tech companies are weaker financially than others. Oracle…needs to borrow billions more for its spending spree, prompting Moody’s Ratings and S&P Global Ratings to edge closer to reclassifying Oracle’s bonds as junk debt. In recent weeks, the company’s stock price has fallen 32% and its bonds have lost about 7%. There’s also the risk that the chips tech firms are borrowing to buy could be obsolete in a few year… The last time Wall Street went all-in on an industry was the fracking boom—then bust—over a decade ago. This time, financiers are marshaling even larger sums. The article continues with a breathless account of the boomtown effect that these datacenter buildouts are generating. Matt Stoller flagged the concern of growing real-economy dependence on massive spend in what ought to be a niche: A few months ago, I asked why our economy, despite steady growth in official numbers, feels so creepy and unstable. My conclusion was that the U.S. is in a “Chinese finger trap” economy. We are dependent for growth on monopolies and an AI bubble, which juices the all-important stock market. Trying to grow an economy in a more stable way could lower stock prices which would paradoxically lead to a downturn. So we’re stuck, until some outside event occurs…. Data center developers are now approaching multiple utilities with proposals for the same project, leading to “phantom” forecasts of demand that isn’t actually there. Essentially, it’s hoarding. Hoarding is what happen in overheated markets….But this can lead to something called the “bullwhip effect.” Buyers overstate how much they want to buy….all of a sudden the demand evaporates because it was never real in the first place. This dynamic can throw an economy into an overheated state, and then a depression; that’s what happened globally after World War I, leading to, among other things, Mussolini’s takeover of Italy…. At this point, data centers are pretty much what’s growing in America. I recently had a conversation with an elected official who told me that data center construction is a huge construction jobs boost in rust belt areas….He posited a tension between political support for the new temporary jobs and political anger over higher electricity prices. We have a one-legged economy, with the AI build-out serving as a driver of real estate values, the stock market, and GDP growth This is a bet-the-economy scheme on models where China has much better mousetraps. There is no way this will end well. ____ 1 The crisis demonstrated that theory and practice can be two different things. Banks had long offloaded credit card receivables to investors in supposedly off-balance sheet deals. When losses on them rose to previously unthinkable levels, the investors successfully revolted and made the banks eat some of those costs. The reason was the bank credit card businesses depended on being able to keep using other people’s credit. I am not sure whether or not these AI datacenter borrowers won’t wind up in an analogous position, of being so dependent on ongoing lending that lenders won’t let them walk away from outsized credit losses. “companies like Meta who are perfectly capable of borrowing in their own name paying 200-300% basis points extra” Yves, I noticed something that should be fixed: “% basis points”. Incompatible units, right? Aargh, fixing, thanks. “…have ironclad leases that will generate the money to pay investors back.” Bwaahhh!!! That is until those leases hit the smelters of the bankruptcy courts! Ed Dowd on the US economic, the AI bubble, the stock market, and the housing market. utube, ~1 hr. Ed Dowd: We’re Already in a Recession, Oil Going to $30 & The Deflation Scare Coming https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHM-BH-SguE Excellent discussion and economic assessments by Dowd. These are Capitalists to the core. Meta and much of big tech still have corporate stock buyback plans open. Incentives drive outcomes—-companies have move incentive to lever-up and chase the AI headlines than being seen as a 1989-era IBM (a company missing a secular pivot). “…China has much better mousetraps.” Listened recently to an interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin on this topic taking much the same line as the above article, during which he claimed as an example of China’s technical and manufacturing prowess that BYD electric vehicles are the gold standard that are better and cheaper than U.S. cars and that if the U.S. didn’t have tariffs on Chinese cars we would probably not have and an auto industry in the U.S. I’m giving serious consideration to encouraging my USian grandchildren to learn Mandarin, https://www.newyorker.com/video/watch/the-radio-hour-andrew-ross-sorkin-in-conversation-with-andrew-ross-sorkin (Minute 12:33) When you’ve lost Andrew Ross Sorkin… I saw a video on the YouTube’s last night so it must be true… BYD just test drove, (introduced?) an EV that will reach speeds over 200 miles an hour. I think they were at 300+ mph Believe it o not, an electric motor can generate enormous rotational torque. Combustion engines are no match. Getting to 200-300 mph is more a matter of stability and aerodynamics. Too many EV’s on a US freeway will create the same congestion as an ICE vehicle. I’ve driven and owned a number of ICE muscle cars, mostly during my misspent youth, that I found impressively fast off the line. Now I drive a little Toyota hybrid, which frankly feels a bit like riding around in a sardine can, that upon acceleration can give you whiplash. I exaggerate but slightly. Believe it or not, torque can not be anything but rotational. :) “Linear torque” is force. Also, torque can be multiplied via gears, while power can’t. Steam engines and electric motors tend to produce maximum torque close to zero rpm, which is the “believe it or not” part for ICE only drivers (with diesel engines being better at low rpm torque than petrol ones). Limited range of rotational speeds with useful torque is why trasmission is a necessity (and also why big trucks have more gears). Getting to 200-300 mph is a matter of many things, but mostly not crashing. :) Son in law just received his Tesla cyber truck. He loves it, so far. We talked about the almost instant high torque etc. Tech features are great! Run everything from the smart phone. My nephew has had the EV Rivian pick-up for a couple of years he still loves it. I saw it Saturday! I hope my daughter stops calling their cyber truck the “dumpster”. At 75 I’ll stay with the ICE-SUV. My one-owner 1977 Chevrolet Cabriolet, with second 305 V8, 270.000 miles, low rev – high torque, runs like new. A random professional-American’s Mandarin will never be good as their random Chinese equivalent’s English. Particularly as English is the de-facto international working language in Asia, which is much more linguistically diverse than Europe’s Proto-Indo-European-descendant languages. Don’t push Mandarin just because of China in a vacuum (though obviously the thought counts). China isn’t just Mandarin, it’s a civilizational tradition that evolved independently of the west’s Greco-Roman-Enlightenment lineage—-an obvious statement, but something that’s lost on lots of credentialed, supposedly educated, people. And today’s “Communist China” is just one page in its lengthy history. “And today’s “Communist China” is just one page in its lengthy history.” Truly. The pages that have for the most part drawn my interest over the years are those having to do with the development of Buddhism in that country. One thing in particular that strikes me is that the Chinese took the more asocial natural mysticism of India and Southeast Asia and made it more fit for purpose in a materially practical, more socially engaged way of living. Yes, I communicate with Chinese entrepreneurs and their English is as good or better than lifelong Americans. I’m told their linguistic skill is not unusual. I just started listening to an audiobook “Empire of AI”. One line of thinking in the book is that “size/scale/compute power” is not the only infrastructure model one can choose from to chase the elusive AGI unicorn (another topic the book explores). This is the predominant line of thinking running thru SV though. Open AI seized the narrative and strategically decided to achieve AGI thru sheer scale and size of its compute resources. 3 hours into the book so far but its very interesting. Thanks for the book tip. I’m currently reading Adam Becker’s More Everything Forever describing beliefs and intentions prevalent among Silicon Valley elites. “Inmates running the asylum” is a phrase that comes to mind. And not in a good way as in King of Hearts. $133B in questionable debt? Just file it under “other.” Here we have JP Morgan blazing the opacity trail. Thanks for this background, Yves. To me, this finance perspective confirms some things I think about AI and data centers. An example from a portion of the Journal article you quote: But some tech companies are weaker financially than others. Oracle…needs to borrow billions more for its spending spree, prompting Moody’s Ratings and S&P Global Ratings to edge closer to reclassifying Oracle’s bonds as junk debt. In recent weeks, the company’s stock price has fallen 32% and its bonds have lost about 7%. Why risk so much? Hasn’t stock price been sacred in the post-Greenspan era? Doesn’t this seem to be about more than even money? I think I’ve found part of the answer in two interviews Ross Douthat, the Roman Catholic New York Times columnist, has done in the past year. The first, Douthat’s interview of Peter Thiel is second perhaps only to Tucker’s sit-down with Nick Fuentes among widely viewed videos. The second one, done in the past few days, is of Paul Kingsnorth, who’s on a book tour promoting his new book, Against the Machine: The Unmaking of Humanity. I was introduced to Kingsnorth through amfortas’s links to the Dark Mountain Project, which was begun by Kingsnorth and Dougald Hine. I recommend listening to the Thiel interview before the Kingsnorth one because Douthat and Kingsnorth discuss that interview at some length. It’s also interesting contrast the two interviewees’ personalities and characters. (Kingsnorth calls the projects of Thiel and Musk “little boys’ toys,” an example of his barely contained contempt for them.) I have watched about 15min of the first interview and paused at about 15 min of the second and, whatever one thinks about Kingsnorth he can be labelled as freethinker while Thiel not. The later is heavily influenced by his attachments (to his companies, money, whatever he is attached to) no matter how much he would like to appear as a freethinker. I couldn’t stomach Thiel for longer while I will probably end Kingsnorth interview even if i do not agree completely with him in some instances but he is much more interesting than Thiel. One shakes the brain and the other shakes the stomach. Let me recommend the latest interview of Emmanuel Todd by Glenn Diesen which I found interesting. This are people who shake one beliefs and that is good. Agree with Ignacio about Diesen’s interview of Todd. For once, Diesen pretty much shut up & let Todd talk. Todds latest book is about the loss of the West. He gets heavily into the loss of the philosophical “center” of the West- sort of there being no there there. He says that Western society has become a “Zombie” society like the Nazis. Well worth the listen! Like this: from 2024, In view of this, ladies and gentlemen, what we can conclude is that the adoration of transvestites is an inevitable consequence of liberalism, and that the Inquisition burned too few people. I will not venture into the twisted nest of vipers that is Thiel’s brain, but Kingsnorth will be worth a listen, thanks. I’m meeting with my Minnesota AI vs. water people tomorrow. It’ll be interesting to hear their perspective. Data centers might try to propose one project to competing power companies but there’s only one water source (and regulator). If the volume of permit amendment applications from water utilitues/cities has fallen (data centers in MN do not supply their own water), the number of data center projects in MN will have fallen proportionally. I’m trying to think about what’s similar and different with dotcom. 1) Similar to AI, dotcom had a huge infra build-out of core network fiber, switching, and data centers. Not all of that was scrap as some of it has relatively long useful life, especially fiber and switching, unlike AI GPUs. 2) The demand for dotcom infra was real, growing, and continues to grow. The dotcom bubble was supply. The Inernet as such was not vaporware. In AI it’s not clear how much money there really is in psychopathic search engines and generation of videos of dogs with 5 legs. A lot of the ultimate “demand” may be hype. 3) As Yves so well presents above, the financials of the AI bubble may involve a lot more leverage than dotcom. So what are we facing? Something worse than dotcom but not worse than GFC? The public Internet in the 90’s was not vaporware. It was the long developing son of the military/university ARPANET (network) from the 70’s. The early Internet was communication over phone lines. As public access grew cable/fiber optics were seen as necessary to get increased public/business participation. Unfortunately, laying cable was faster than public uptake. Until. of course, Netscape, and other graphical user interface that didn’t require knowledge of computer programming. Then, with exploding popularity (ease of use), the Internet demanded cable and fiber connectivity. Something tells me AGI is not going to follow this breakout scenario. Yea GUI, and they said no one would pay those hundreds of dollars for that heavy CRT. On #2. you are GREATLY confusing dotcom infrastructure with companies selling “eyeballs’. Most of the bubble was in the latter. There’s also the risk that the chips tech firms are borrowing to buy could be obsolete in a few year… Leaving aside for the moment the overall ridiculous nature of the AI technology boom and the fact that it is going to come crashing down of its own accord quite soon since LLVMs are not fit for their advertised purpose, any above quote seems like it highlights another risk-within-a-risk. GPUs are a very high technology product that most people don’t know much about beyond a few acronyms. Using them as debt collateral seems very fraught in its own right since no one knows enough about them to decide what they are worth and in particular how quickly they’re going to depreciate. Nvidia recently announced that they are going to a one-year design cycle, meaning all the chips that were purchased in 2025 will be superseded by newer, more powerful chips in 2026, and so on each year. I imagine this will create a big hit to the older models, and I imagine after this happens a few times the older chips will be essentially worthless. I don’t know what the term of the debt is that is being backed by these chips, but if it’s more than a couple of years this is obviously a shipwreck waiting to happen. There are other changes in the technological landscape that can also render existing GPU hardware worthless in one way or another, including changes in software architecture and new manufacturers coming on the scene with cheaper and more powerful products. These kinds of things are both hard to predict and reasonably likely to happen. Some physical objects, like real estate, vehicles, precious gems, and so on seem to make fairly reasonable collateral (even so, look at the record!), but new and evolving integrated circuits of very high density and complexity don’t fit into that category. 1. I am yet to hear of significant proposals stateside to expand electric generation capacity – plus transmission lines – to support all this projected data center growth. And remember, the US is a fragmented electricity space (10 separate market regions in just the lower 48), with differing regulatory rules (Texas does not equal New York does not equal California), so these need to be done at the local level. The Russians have publically talked about using the new modular type nuclear reactors (including the ones they’d developed for the Burevestnik and the Poseidon weapons), though for now data centers do not seem at the top of their energy or nuke priorities (they’re replacing their aging nukes plus upgrading the infrastructure in historically underserved regions like Yakutia). The Chinese are drastically increasing their nuke capacity, paying the Russians a healthy chunk so to do. The Americans……….eh? Or maybe I’ve just missed it. But all these plans for data center buildouts without the generation and transmission to go with are bound to run into quite the obstacle once they start drawing enough power to drop a given market region below its “reserve margin” level (typically 12% over peak demand is how much you want in generation), or, if god forbid these idiots build them in Texas, which is the only fully deregulated market, cause “ice storm” level price spikes for customers. 2. I am not sure what you would use as collateral if you’re doing any secured or ABS type financing for these data centers. The buildings themselves? Because here’s the thing. If the servers are meant to do AI-LLM type stuff, that means every year, when the new chips/GPUs come out, you have to upgrade them all, at huge cost. But meanwhile, standard data center tasks do not need this extra capacity and do not need this extra bang for the buck. So 1-2-3 years into the deal you’re stuck with a bunch of formerly high-end chips that no-one needs, unless you pile even more money into the place? Or think about it this way. Whenever I build my own PC, instead of buying the latest, most high-end CPU and video card, I buy the ones from ~2 years ago. Because at that point the price comes down 50% or more, while the decline in capability – for home user applications – is fairly negligible. The point is, the depreciation on these assets is insane relative to, say, a commercial building, or a power plant, or a refinery or whatever. Or even a commercial aircraft (assumed 25-year useful life, usually). To do an ABS deal secured by chips, if that is, in fact, what they are doing…that is pure insanity. 3. Does anyone remember IBM’s Watson? Their whole thing in the 2000s and early-mid 2010s was – we have this “artificial intelligence” thing called Watson, and we’ll sell it to hospitals and such, where it will make diagnoses and help (read: replace) the medical staff in this and that capacity. And…the whole thing failed, because they could not fix what we now call AI hallucinations. Or, rather, IBM tinkered around with it for a while, with some sample projects in this or that hospital that never went anywhere much, and eventually sold it to some PE guys for ~$1 billion, which is rather less than they’d invested into it in the first place. Of course, the total cost for Watson, at least its medical unit, including all the R&D and whatnot, had to have been in the several billion range at the most, which is something IBM can easily afford. I look at the charts for projected LLM capex spend, and there is just no way to get there from here, unless there is a technological revolution in LLMs no-one knows about. Re #2, the security is the data center lease agreements. I seldom comment on tech since I stopped working in that field 25 years ago, and I deliberately do not use hardware or software services provided by AI, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, etc. Nevertheless, I am typing this on an ancient computer running Linux, which I deliberately configured to run minimal unbloated software, and I realize I need to build a new computer from parts because using my ancient parts is getting too risky. I remember 30 years ago when I eagerly anticipated the weekend edition of the newspaper with the weekend Fry’s Electronics ad. Holy moley! There’s a CPU and ATX motherboard combo for $120. I’m getting it. Without hesitation, I would drive there (or get my dad to drive) and immediately splurge. Then, I got right to work assembling my new computer. Wow, how times have changed for me. I gave you this background to discuss how I have since fallen on hard times, how frugal I am, and how RAM prices have recently soared. Apparently, this happened because of the AI bubble encouraging RAM manufacturers to divert their resources away from desktop computer memory and components on RAM modules to continue feeding the AI bubble. Because I am not too knowledgeable about this, let me link to the Hardware Unboxed videos “DDR5 Pricing Skyrockets, What’s Going On?” and “VRAM Cost Is About To Make GPUs Way More Expensive“. I have been dreaming about buying new parts for a new computer for 6-12 months now. One year ago a 2×16 GB package of DDR5 RAM was approximately $100 USD. Today, that could be well over $200. That difference is enough to discourage me from buying. Three companies dominate the market for memory: Samsung, Micron, and Hynix. The AI bubble seems to have affected all three companies and respective prices for RAM. Of course, I could try to skimp in other areas. I didn’t pay attention to computers for a decade or more. Thus, I got up to speed recently in anticipation of any supposed Black Friday promotions. Apparently, Intel makes garbage chips now. That leaves one other option, AMD. AMD’s latest and greatest platform is named AM5 (with AM6 forthcoming), but I could deliberately buy an AM4 CPU, AM4 motherboard, and DDR4 RAM. DDR4 RAM did not get excluded from whatever frothiness is going on with AI. It’s all kind of spendy. Argh! Risk to the big 7 paying off these debts: Trump fails to prevent China’s DeepSeek from dominating Sam Altman’s too much computer, too much training overhead. Big 7 intro/monopoly power already gone. Data center build outs delayed by grid connection, if the grid can get debt to build out. Project and supply chain delays. Some number of US/EU sources doing programming like DeepSeek. If big 7 make any profit it will be short lived. HE/SW life cycle very short. Any underwriter not following scientific papers is not doing due diligence. But, the fed balance sheet has over $2.5 trillion in MBS, etc. Most with >10 years left. Might as well tranche the big 7 debts and move on. Buckle up! Reuters just reported CDS’ are being drawn up on big AI risk. Weinstein, Saba…. Is this the report you mean? https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/weinsteins-saba-sells-credit-derivatives-big-tech-as-ai-risks-grow-source-says-2025-11-17/ Boaz Weinstein’s Saba Capital Management has sold credit derivatives in recent months to lenders seeking protection on big tech names like Oracle and Microsoft due to concerns over a debt-financed AI investment frenzy, a source told Reuters. Banks have sought to shield their exposure to potential losses by buying credit default swaps (CDS) from the U.S. hedge fund manager, known for his winning bet against the JPMorgan Chase, opens new tab trader dubbed the “London Whale”, the person said. While the credit insurance rises in value in tandem with the perceived risk of a company’s default, current prices indicate those risks are still low compared to other sectors. Yes, thank you for linking it here…. “current prices indicate those risks are still low compared to other sectors.” is a stretch! Jensen Huang says NVDA will sell $500 to $600 billion in GPU chips next couple of years…. where will the money come from? i dont really believe in the ability of companies to supply data centers with enough electricity in the long run. thus in my mind, the fate of data centers many years down the line is likely some sort of looting for parts – if not electrical components, then the base metals used in the electrical components. additionally, the oversupply of datacenters begs another question: what about the data? how are they getting enough data to compute in these centers? you need either more experimental data being gathered (phones, surveillance, maybe drones) or something from ab initio guys. Jeff Bezos has entered the chat… I think this is becoming as silly as the original Dot Com bubble. According to the Guardian article you linked, so has Michael Burry. Michael Burry, best known for accurately predicting the 2008 housing crisis, recently invested $1bn in bets that Palantir and Nvidia shares will fall just days after he accused some of the big tech firms of using accounting tricks to “artificially boost earnings”. Thanks for posting this article. I’m still trying to digest it all. I think this is related – has anybody noticed what’s happening to RAM? Prices are going nuts: RAM: WTF? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hLiwNViMak A memory upgrade that I was looking at earlier this year for around $120 is now approaching $500. I don’t know if this will bleed into prices for other devices that use RAM and other ICs used in server grade hardware, but if this keeps up, it will.

AI friends for kids? Yikes! NO! I’ve come across a couple of instances where medical researchers in the U.S. are using AI. In one they’re attempting to discover possible cures to various diseases through the off-label use of existing medications. The Medical Matchmaking Machine Radiolab (1 hour, 12 minute audio). This is quite a story as the principal researcher was a doctor who, without AI, discovered an off-label use for an existing medication to save his own life and that of others. Other researchers are using AI to develop new drugs without much success as of yet. AI Was Supposed To Discover New Drugs. Where Are They? Science Friday (18 minute audio with transcript) Thanks!

A Wealth of Common Sense Posted November 16, 2025 by Ben Carlson Michael and I were out in Las Vegas last week to put on a live Animal Spirits at the annual FPA conference. It was a fun trip. We ate some good food, had some fancy cocktails, played some blackjack and talked some artificial intelligence with a few hundred financial advisors. On stage we did a deep dive into what’s going on with the biggest companies in the world and their push for AI supremacy. You can listen to the audio from the podcast here: If you weren’t one of the lucky people in the MGM conference center that day I thought it would be useful to provide some of the slides we covered in our presentation. First up we talked about the shift from investing in intangible to tangible assets by the big tech firms using Meta’s new Hyperion data center as an example: These companies believe AI is worth the investment but this is a risk and a change to their business models. Spending from the hyperscalers continues to go up, up and away: How long will stock market investors allow this? The companies spending money are getting the benefit of the doubt that this will all pay off. I do wonder when the market will want to see a big ROI on this spend. The sheer size of these companies is astounding: The Mag 7 stocks are now as big as the bottom 449 stocks in the S&P 500 combined. It seems we’ve entered the new normal of stock market concentration: At least for now. One of the reasons for this is that fundamentals are matching the stock price gains: Nvidia is now the biggest company in the U.S. stock market but the fundamental growth has exceeded the price growth since the release of ChatGPT. Analysts expect the growth to continue: Is it possible for a $5 trillion company to grow at these insane levels for this long? We shall see. Here’s a real face-blower for you: Apple and Nvidia alone are now worth nearly as much as the health care and consumer staples sectors combined. Here’s another one for you — the market cap of the Mag 7 stocks is now the same size as the energy, materials, consumer staples, health care, financials, utilities and real estate sectors combined. There have been instances of stock market concentration in the past. But we’ve never had corporations this efficient before. If you take this efficiency into account by adjusting valuations for the changes in margins, the market doesn’t appear as expensive as you might think: One of the biggest questions of the AI boom is how much the other companies that aren’t making these investments will benefit. Outside of tech, the margins are much smaller: Will AI improve productivity enough for some of these other companies to increase their margins? That would be something. And finally — the question everyone wants to know — will this end badly for these huge companies? The Mag 7 is no stranger to crashes this decade: When the expectations get out of whack will we see some or all of these stocks crash? And what does a crash look like? A 20% decline is nothing. Meta is down more than 20% from the highs right now: Are we looking at a 40% crash? 50% or more? Would an AI bubble popping offer a wonderful buying opportunity because these companies are still better at what they do than everyone else? Or what if these companies see a payoff sooner than we think and the gigantic crash never comes? I have three words to sum up my conclusion on the matter: I. Don’t. Know. If anyone tells you they know how this will play out they have a horrible case of hubris or just want their investment stance to be proven right. I remain open to a wide range of outcomes on the matter.

Title: Apple is ramping up succession plans for CEO Tim Cook and may tap this hardware exec to take over, report says
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/11/15/apple-succession-plans-ceo-tim-cook-exec-ai-investment-tech/
Time Published: 2025-11-15T20:07:18Z
Full Content:
Apple’s board of directors and senior executives have been accelerating succession plans for Tim Cook, sources told the Financial Times. After serving as CEO for 14 years, Cook may step down as early as next year, the report said. Apple’s senior vice president of hardware engineering, 50-year-old John Ternus, is widely seen as the most likely successor, but no final decisions have been made yet, sources told the FT. The engineer joined Apple’s product design team in 2001 and has overseen hardware engineering for most major products the tech company has launched ever since, according to Ternus’ LinkedIn profile. He has also played a prominent role during Apple’s most recent keynotes, introducing products like the new iPhone Air. Ternus had been rumored to be Cook’s potential successor, according to previous reports. The company is unlikely to name a new CEO before its next earnings report in late January, and an early-year announcement would allow a new leadership team time to settle in before its annual events, the FT said. The succession preparations have been long-planned and are not related to the company’s current performance, which is expecting strong end-of-year sales, people close to Apple told the FT. Apple did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment and declined to provide a comment to the FT. The $4 trillion company is expecting year-on-year revenue growth of 10% to 12% for its holiday quarter ending in December, fueled by the release of the iPhone 17 model in September. Ternus would take the helm of the tech giant at an important time in its evolution. Although Apple has seen sales success with iPhones and new products like Airpods over the past couple of decades, it has struggled to break into AI and keep up with rivals. Instead, Apple has even spending significantly less in AI investments compared to Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft. Apple has been criticized by analysts this year for not having a clear AI strategy. And despite approving a multibillion-dollar budget to run its own models via the cloud in 2026, it was reported in June that Apple is even considering using models from OpenAI and Anthropic to power its updated version of Siri, rather than using technology the company has built in-house. Its AI-enabled Siri, originally slated for 2025, will be delayed until 2026 or later due to a series of technical challenges, the company announced earlier this year. Apple has also lost a number of senior AI team members since January, many of whom have joined Meta’s AI and Superintelligence Labs during talent poaching wars this year. The exodus of Apple’s AI execs included Ruoming Pang, former head of Apple’s foundation models and core generative AI team, who joined Meta with a compensation package reportedly worth $200 million. The company is also dealing with increased competition from one of its most influential former employees. In May, Sam Altman’s OpenAI acquired startup io for about $6.5 billion, bringing in former Apple chief designer Jony Ive to build AI devices. The 58-year-old designer was instrumental in creating the iPhone, iPod, and iPad. Cook, Apple’s former operations chief, turned 65 this month. He has grown the company’s market capitalization to $4 trillion from $350 billion in 2011, when he took over the CEO role from company co-founder Steve Jobs. Under Cook, Apple became the first publicly traded company to reach $1 trillion in market capitalization in 2018—then it became the first company to reach $3 trillion in market cap in 2022. But more recently, its stock price has been lagging behind Big Tech rivals Alphabet, Nvidia, and Microsoft, though Apple is trading close to an all-time high after strong earnings were reported in October. Apple has also dealt with tariff complications as U.S.-China trade tensions have disrupted its supply chain. Cook has previously said he’d prefer an internal candidate to replace him, adding that the company has “very detailed succession plans.” “I really want the person to come from within Apple,” Cook told singer Dua Lipa last year on her podcastAt Your Service.

PHOTO: AFP Published Nov 15, 2025, 09:45 PM Updated Nov 16, 2025, 08:15 PM NEW YORK - The US shutdown has ended, but the hangover is just beginning for investors, who worry gaps in economic data will delay or even derail Federal Reserve rate cuts just as concerns over lofty AI stock valuations have put fresh pressure on companies’ stocks and bonds. Unease drove the heaviest sell-off for the rate-sensitive Nasdaq in a month on Nov 13. The index, which has soared in 2025 with booming AI shares, is down about 4 per cent from October’s peak. Pressure continued in early trade on Nov 14, with blue chip bourses from Tokyo to Paris and London deep in the red, but eased later in the day with the S&P 500 ending slightly lower and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.13 per cent. Even gold and Bitcoin were not spared, the latter hitting lows last seen in May. Credit spreads – or the premium over US Treasuries paid by companies to issue bonds in the US market – widened earlier in November. “The market certainly has some froth both in terms of valuations and expectations”, said Mr Michael McGowan, managing director of investment strategy at Pathstone. “I think there’s a healthy scepticism coming into the market and you could certainly see that continue to play out a little more,” he said. The problem is being exacerbated by an information vacuum that ranges from futures positioning to crop estimates and in particular job and price figures, some of which were not collected during the 43 days of shutdown. There is doubt about the publication of October’s inflation data and the employment report for that month will not include the jobless rate, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said, because the household survey from which it is calculated was not conducted. On Nov 14, the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labour Statistics announced they would begin releasing data skipped over during the shutdown starting next week. Employment data for September, which had been scheduled for release on Oct 3, will be published on Nov 20. The gaps in the data matter for markets because Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has likened the situation to “driving in the fog” and flagged that policymakers are likely to “slow down” in response, or in other words hold rather than cut interest rates, after two consecutive cuts in September and October. Mr Tim Horan, chief investment officer of fixed income at Chilton Trust, said: “We were able to see a September cut and an October cut because they felt confident in their direction of travel for inflation... Will they have that confidence at the December meeting with the lack of data points?” Expectations for a 25-basis point rate cut in December, seen as a sure thing a month ago, are down to about 46 per cent, according to CME’s FedWatch tool. “We’ve obviously had a huge rally in the market from the April trough, and it’s pretty much been uninterrupted,” said Mr Matt Sherwood, head of investment strategy at Perpetual in Sydney. “(It) requires Fed rate cuts and sustained easy financial conditions to justify what I think are extreme valuations.” The forward price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500, based on earnings estimates for the next 12 months, is currently around 22.8 times, well above its 10-year average of 18.8, according to LSEG Datastream. Together with year-to-date gains above 20 per cent in hard-running sectors such as technology, it also does not take much for investors to want to lock in some gains. Already, the mood has turned fickle and darlings such as Palantir and Oracle have logged losses around 12 per cent and 14 per cent, respectively, in November. Chipmaker Nvidia is down 6 per cent. Nvidia’s results next week are critical, given the stock has been at the fore of the record-breaking stock rally in 2025. “We’re at a time of year here where any kind of downside might ripple a little bit further in certain sectors that have really put up big numbers this year, as you’re going to have some trigger fingers to take some profits off the table,” said Mr Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. Meanwhile, Mr Michael Burry’s decision to close his hedge fund Scion Asset Management on Nov 13 added to jitters over frothy AI valuations. He has argued that tech giants pouring billions into Nvidia chips and servers are quietly stretching out depreciation schedules to make earnings look smoother. Valuation concerns spilled over into corporate debt markets, too. Bonds issued by Oracle Corp have taken a hit in recent days as concerns rise over the cloud and AI giant’s huge debt issuance to further fund its AI infrastructure. Hedge funds disclosed their third-quarter positioning on Nov 14 with some showing possible bearishness on tech. Tiger Global Management, the hedge fund founded and led by Mr Chase Coleman, showed it slashed its stake in Facebook parent Meta Platforms. During the shutdown, the data void shot previously little-followed private surveys to prominence and painted a mixed picture of the economy where spending appears to be holding up but, on some measures, layoffs have surged. Investors have struggled to draw conclusions and have stuck with expectations for at least three cuts by the end of 2026 to take rates to about 3 per cent. Analysts say that view is likely to face pressure, especially as a growing number of policymakers are sounding reticent on rate cuts. “The Fed is flying blind as we are,” said Mr Bob Savage, head of markets macro strategy at BNY in New York.
