Shares in three of the “Magnificent Seven” — Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta — moved in different directions in after-hours trading after they released their third-quarter results. The earnings once again underscored how artificial intelligence continues to dominate Big Tech’s growth story and investor sentiment. (Source: Reuters) Alphabet’s shares surged 6.2% after the Google parent beat Wall Street estimates for third-quarter revenue. Both its core advertising business and its cloud computing unit showed steady growth. The company also raised its capital expenditure forecast for the year to between $91 billion and $93 billion, far above earlier projections of around $80 billion. Microsoft’s stock fell 3.4% in extended trading even after posting blockbuster growth in its cloud-computing business, which pushed its quarterly revenue past expectations. The results showed that businesses are still spending aggressively on AI services despite concerns about a potential bubble. Analysts noted that Microsoft’s heavy AI investments are now starting to deliver meaningful returns. Meta’s shares dropped more than 8% after the company reported a $16 billion one-time charge in the third quarter related to U.S. President Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill. The social media giant also said its capital expenditure next year would be “notably larger” than in 2025. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been personally leading an AI talent hiring spree and plans to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in massive AI data centres for superintelligence. Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, said the results were a mixed bag for markets. “The good reaction in Alphabet offsets Microsoft’s uninspiring outcome and Meta’s surprise tax loss,” he said, adding that the stock moves were mostly within expected volatility ranges, with Microsoft’s reaction relatively muted. According to Bespoke Investment Group, the latest earnings confirm that there is no sign of a slowdown in the AI capital spending boom. The firm noted that the combined capital expenditure of the three companies rose by $14 billion quarter-on-quarter, or more than 22%, maintaining the same pace as the previous quarter and up 88% from a year ago. Despite the mixed share price reactions, the overall message is clear — AI remains the centrepiece of Big Tech’s long-term strategy. While short-term costs are weighing on profitability, investors continue to bet that these massive infrastructure investments will yield significant payoffs in the years ahead.

Title: Meta’s stock slides on AI bubble fears, as Zuckerberg calls for increased spending

UPDATED 22:19 EDT / OCTOBER 29 2025 by Mike Wheatley Meta Platforms Inc.’s plans to increase spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure made investors jittery today, and its stock fell more than 6% in extended trading, despite the social network posting solid earnings and revenue beats. In its third-quarter results, the company reported earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of $7.25 per share, crushing Wall Street’s targets. Analysts had projected earnings of just $6.69 per share. The company’s revenue also came in above expectations, rising 26% from a year earlier, to $51.24 billion. The Street had been looking for just $49.41 billion in sales. However, the company’s bottom line took a massive hit in the quarter, with net income coming to just $2.7 billion, down from a profit of $15.68 billion in the year-ago period. That’s because Meta was slapped with a substantial onetime tax charge of $15.93 billion that relates to U.S. President Donald Trump’s recently implemented One Big Beautiful Bill Act. On a conference call, Meta Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said the Act will ultimately be beneficial to the company, leading to a “significant reduction” in its federal cash tax payments for the remainder of 2025 and future years. Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg (pictured) hailed what he said was a strong quarter for both the business and its community. “Meta Superintelligence Labs is off to a great start and we continue to lead the industry in AI glasses,” he added. “If we deliver even a fraction of the opportunity ahead, then the next few years will be the most exciting period in our history.” Looking at the current quarter, Meta said it anticipates revenue of between $56 billion and $59 billion, with the midpoint of that range falling just shy of Wall Street’s target of $57.58 billion estimate. It wasn’t the guidance that got investors unduly worried, but rather the fact that Meta once again announced plans to increase its spending. Li told analysts the company is raising the low end of its spending forecast by $2 billion, and said the new forecast range is now between $116 billion and $118 billion, up from a range of $114 billion to $118 billion. In addition, the company also upped its fiscal 2025 capital expenditure guidance, saying this will now amount to between $70 billion and $72 billion, up from a previous range of $66 billion to $72 billion. In recent months, concerns have been growing among some critics that the extravagant spending by Meta and its big technology peers is fueling a bubble in the AI industry that may one day burst, with potentially devastating consequences for the stock market. The company has invested billions of dollars into AI, not only on the data center infrastructure it needs but also in acquiring talented developers, such as Scale AI Inc. founder Alexandr Wang, who now heads up the company’s Superintelligence Labs unit. On the call, Zuckerberg did his best to address these concerns, saying that he is seeing a “pattern” that shows Meta will likely need to invest in even more computing infrastructure than it initially believed it would need. That’s why the company has also signed massive, multibillion-dollar cloud computing contracts with the likes of Google Cloud, Oracle Corp. and CoreWeave Inc., he said. But he believes these investments will pay off handsomely for the company over time. “Being able to make a significantly larger investment here is very likely to be a profitable thing over some period,” he promised. Moreover, he expressed confidence that overspending wouldn’t necessarily be the disaster that many envisage. He said that if AI doesn’t grow as fast as he anticipates, the company can always repurpose its new infrastructure for other workloads, such as improving its core recommendation algorithms. He said there’s potential to do this “in a very profitable way.” Zacks Investment Research analyst Andrew Rocco told SiliconANGLE that the increased capex spend suggests that Meta ultimately believes AI will result in people spending more time using its applications, which will generate more advertising revenues from the company. He’s especially optimistic about the prospects of Instagram Reels, which is its highest-growing ad segment. Moreover, he believes most investors understand this. “I expect deep-pocketed institutional investors to defend the stock in the coming days at the $690 to $700 level,” Rocco said. During the quarter, Meta completed a massive overhaul of its AI organization, snatching up Wang and other high-profile talents and creating the Superintelligence Labs unit in the wake of the lukewarm reception of its open-source Llama 4 model in April. Last week, the company caused a surprise when it said it’s laying off about 600 workers from its AI teams, while leaving its top-level TBD Labs alone. Last month, the company debuted a new feature called Vibes in the Meta AI application, which delivers a feed of AI-generated videos, and it has had a promising start. Since Vibes was launched, Meta AI app downloads have increased by 56% to a total of just over 3.9 million. “Vibes is an example of a new content type enabled by AI, and I think that there are more opportunities to build many more novel types of content ahead,” Zuckerberg told analysts. AI may also make a difference to the fortunes of Meta’s Reality Labs business, which has been likened to a black hole or a money pit due to the staggering losses it posts quarter after quarter. In the last three months, it racked up a loss of just over $4.4 billion while generating just $470 million in sales. Moreover, Li said, Reality Labs’ revenue in the fourth quarter is expected to decline from the same period last year. That’s because the company has not released a new virtual reality headset this year, mainly because retailers who purchased inventory of its existing model are waiting to shift that stock over the holiday season. “We’re still expecting significant year-over-year growth in AI glasses revenue in Q4 as we benefit from strong demand for the recent products that we’ve introduced, but that is more than offset by the headwinds to the Quest headsets,” Li said. She was referring to the company’s newly announced Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which launched last month with a $799 price tag. They’re the company’s first consumer-ready AI glasses to feature an integrated display in the lens. They also come with a wristband that enables users to navigate through that display using gesture controls. According to Zuckerberg, the product is sold out, and all demo slots for November have been fully booked up. “We’re going to have to invest in increasing manufacturing and selling more of those,” he explained. Meta reported 3.54 billion daily active people across its family of applications in the quarter, surpassing Wall Street’s target of 3.5 billion. Total advertising sales came to $50.08 billion, also beating expectations. Analysts had been looking for $48.5 billion in ad revenue. CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said the strong ad performance was the main factor behind Meta’s earnings and revenue beat. “Advertising momentum grew 26% in the quarter, benefitting from increased ad impressions, up 14%, and higher average pricing of around 10%,” he said. “Better pricing was key to the beat.” Despite today’s after-hours drop, Meta’s stock has still gained more than 28% in the year to date, outpacing the broader S&P 500 Index, which is up just over 17% in the same period.

Title: Meta Q3 Profit Tumbles 83% Thanks to ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ Tax Charge

Pro Available to WrapPRO members Excluding the charge, net income would have risen in the quarter as daily active users rose year over year Meta’s third-quarter net profit dropped by 83% due to a tax charge implemented as part of President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The tech giant generated $51 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 26% from last year, but the net profit plummeted to $2.7 billion due to the charge. Excluding the charge, net income would have been $18.64 billion, up 19% from a year ago. Meta noted in its earnings release that it expects a significant reduction in U.S. federal cash tax payments for the remainder of 2025 and in the future, but this quarter was significantly affected by a “one-time, non-cash income tax charge of $15.93 billion.” Meta, like many other tech giants, has gone all-in on artificial intelligence, and is pouring billions of dollars into developing AI “superintelligence.” The company believes “superintelligence” represents a “paradigm shift” in how computing works and the kind of relationship it will have with its customers, and executives spent a significant chunk of the earnings conference call to discuss its potential. “We had a strong quarter for our business and our community,” Mark Zuckerberg, Meta founder and CEO, said in the earnings release. “Meta Superintelligence Labs is off to a great start and we continue to lead the industry in AI glasses. If we deliver even a fraction of the opportunity ahead, then the next few years will be the most exciting period in our history.” Meta has a history of exceeding Wall Street’s expectations, beating revenue estimates every single time over the past two years by 2.4% on average. Last quarter the company had its best second quarter to date with revenue of $47.52 billion, outpacing estimates by 6%. The company reported growth in their daily active user base with 3.54 billion visiting one of its apps daily. Meta also noted that it employs 78,450 people as of Sept. 30, an increase of 8% year-over-year. The stock price rose 0.03% to $751.67 in after-hours trading. Here are the key results from Meta’s third quarter report: Revenue: Meta reported $51.24 billion in third quarter sales, up 26% annually, outpacing the $49 billion analysts had projected. Most of the company’s revenue came from advertising. Net income: The company reported $2.71 billion in net income, an 83% drop from the third quarter of 2024 because of tax charges. Excluding the charge, it would’ve been $18.64 billion. Daily active users: Meta’s daily active user base across its apps Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads increased 8% year-over-year to 3.54 billion users. Earnings Per Share: $7.25, which surpassed the $6.71 estimate EPS analysts projected. This figure is adjusted for the tax charge. Signed into law in July, Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act prompted Meta to recognize a valuation allowance against its U.S. federal deferred tax assets. The company had to pay a one-time $15.9 billion charge. While significant, the bill is expected to lower Meta’s future U.S. federal tax payments. The company reported an effective tax rate of 87%. Under the assumption nothing changes in the tax landscape, Meta expects the fourth-quarter tax rate to be 12-15%. Across its family of apps, Meta saw an increase of 14% in ad impressions. On top of that, the average price per ad increased by 10% year-over-year. The company expects fourth-quarter total revenue to be in the range of $56-59 billion. Meta expects the full-year 2025 total expenses to be in the range of $114-118 billion reflecting a growth rate of 20-24% year-over-year. Reality Labs — Meta’s division focused on artificial intelligence, virtual reality and augmented reality technology – lost $4.43 billion in the third quarter. The previous quarter the company lost $4.53 billion on the effort. Meta said the anticipated reduction in Reality Labs revenue is due to the introduction of Quest 3S in the fourth quarter of last year and the Quest headsets hitting the retail market during the third quarter of this year to prepare for the holiday season. The Meta CEO said Instagram has 3 billion monthly active users, and the company’s text-based platform Threads has 150 million daily actives users. Both Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li expressed excitement in Meta’s generative AI video platform Vibes. Li noted that users have generated over 20 billion images using Meta’s products since launching Vibes in September. The company has seen media generation in the app increase more than tenfold. Zuckerberg added that over a billion people use Meta AI on a monthly basis. Zuckerberg expressed continued interest in superintelligence, a level of AI that would match or surpass human-level understanding. Though the CEO did not have specific details on the lab’s advancement, he said they are “heads down developing our next generation of models and products” in order to be the leading frontier AI Lab. “Our approach of advancing open source AI means that when Meta innovates, everyone benefits,” he said. “Meta superintelligence Labs is off to a strong start. I think that we’ve already built the lab with the highest talent density in the industry.” “The company that is the best at each of these capabilities will get a large amount of the potential value for doing that,” Zuckerberg added of Meta’s strategy in forwarding AI implementation. “I’m not sure that any one company is going to be the best at all of them, but what we’re trying to do is to not do some things that others have done. We’re really trying to build novel capabilities, and I’m keeping this high level.” The CEO was coy about the details of Meta’s AI advancements, only noting that they would eventually bolster its existing platforms and services while unlocking new business opportunities.

Title: Meta Earnings: How Will Its AI And Metaverse Investments Perform?

ByAdam Sarhan, Contributor. Meta Platforms is scheduled to report earnings after Wednesday’s close. The stock recently hit a record high near $796.25/share and is currently trading near $746. The stock is prone to big moves after reporting earnings and can easily gap up if the numbers are strong. Conversely, if the numbers disappoint, the stock can easily gap down. To help you prepare, here is what the Street is expecting: The company is expected to report a gain of $6.61/share on $49.34 billion in revenue. Meanwhile, the so-called Whisper number is a gain of $7.21/share. The Whisper number is the Street's unofficial view on earnings. The company has grown its earnings nicely over the last several years. In 2020 the company earned $9.78. In 2021, the company earned $13.77. In 2022, earnings fell to $8.59. Then, in 2023 earnings soared to $15.56. In 2024, earnings jumped to $23.86 and are expected to grow to $28.29 in 2025. In 2026, earnings are expected to grow again to $30.19. Meanwhile, the stock sports a price to earnings ratio of 27 which is around the same (1x) the S&P 500. Technically, the stock is acting strong and is building a new bullish base after recently hitting a fresh record high. Currently, the stock is trading around 6% below its all-time high which is bullish considering it was down double digits from its record high earlier this year. Near-term support is the 50 day moving average (DMA) line and then the 200 DMA line. The stock can easily gap up and that’s what the bulls want to see after earnings are announced. Conversely, the bears want to see it gap down and fall. Meta Platforms, Inc. engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. It operates in two segments, Family of Apps and Reality Labs. The Family of Apps segment offers Facebook, which enables people to share, discuss, discover, and connect with interests; Instagram, a community for sharing photos, videos, and private messages, as well as feed, stories, reels, video, live, and shops; Messenger, a messaging application for people to connect with friends, family, communities, and businesses across platforms and devices through text, audio, and video calls; and WhatsApp, a messaging application that is used by people and businesses to communicate and transact privately. The Reality Labs segment provides augmented and virtual reality related products comprising consumer hardware, software, and content that help people feel connected, anytime, and anywhere. The company was formerly known as Facebook, Inc. and changed its name to Meta Platforms, Inc. in October 2021. The company was incorporated in 2004 and is headquartered in Menlo Park, California. From where I sit, the most important trait I look for during earnings season is how the market and a specific company reacts to the news. Remember, always keep your losses small and never argue with the tape. Disclosure: The stock has been previously featured as a leading stock on my stock market membership site: FindLeadingStocks.com

Title: The rise and fall of globalisation: why the world’s next financial meltdown could be much worse with the US on the sidelines

View all partners https://doi.org/10.64628/AB.kfpkrfqkw Share article Print article This is the second in a two-part series. Read part one here. Globalisation has always had its critics – but until recently, they have come mainly from the left rather than the right. In the wake of the second world war, as the world economy grew rapidly under US dominance, many on the left argued that the gains of globalisation were unequally distributed, increasing inequality in rich countries while forcing poorer countries to implement free-market policies such as opening up their financial markets, privatising their state industries and rejecting expansionary fiscal policies in favour of debt repayment – all of which mainly benefited US corporations and banks. This was not a new concern. Back in 1841, German economist Friedrich List had argued that free trade was designed to keep Britain’s global dominance from being challenged, suggesting: When anyone has obtained the summit of greatness, he kicks away the ladder by which he climbs up, in order to deprive others of the means of climbing up after him. By the 1990s, critics of the US vision of a global world order such as the Nobel-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz argued that globalisation in its current form benefited the US at the expense of developing countries and workers – while author and activist Naomi Klein focused on the negative environmental and cultural consequences of the global expansion of multinational companies. Mass left-led demonstrations broke out, disrupting global economic meetings including, most famously, the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1999. During this “battle of Seattle”, violent exchanges between protesters and police prevented the launch of a new world trade round that had been backed by then US president, Bill Clinton. For a while, the mass mobilisation of a coalition of trade unionists, environmentalists and anti-capitalist protesters seemed set to challenge the path towards further globalisation – with anti-capitalism “Occupy” protests spreading around the world in the wake of the 2008 financial crash. In the US, a further critique of globalisation centred on its domestic consequences for American workers – namely, job losses and lower pay – and led to calls for greater protectionism. Although initially led by trade unions and some Democratic politicians, this critique gradually gained purchase in radical right circles who opposed giving any role to international organisations like the WTO, on the grounds that they impinged on American sovereignty. According to this view, only by stopping foreign competition whose low wages undercut American workers could prosperity be restored. Immigration was another target. Under Donald Trump’s second term as US president, these criticisms have been transformed into radical, deeply disruptive economic and social policies – with tariffs and protectionism at their heart. In so doing, Trump – despite all his grandstanding on the world stage – has confirmed what has long been clear to close observers of US politics and business: that the American century of global dominance, with the dollar as unrivalled no.1 currency, is drawing rapidly to a close. Even before Trump first took office in 2017, the US had begun to withdraw from its leadership role in international economic institutions such as the WTO. Now, the strongest part of its economy, the hi-tech sector, is under intense pressure from China, whose economy is already bigger than the US’s by one key measure of GDP. Meanwhile, the majority of US citizens are facing stagnant incomes, higher prices and more insecure jobs. In previous centuries, when first France and then Great Britain reached the end of their eras of world domination, these transitions had painful impacts beyond their borders. This time, with the global economy more closely integrated than ever before and no single dominant power waiting in the wings to take over, the impacts could be felt even more widely – with very damaging, if not catastrophic, results. When it comes to taking over from the US as the world’s leading hegemonic power, the only viable candidates with big enough economies are the European Union and China. But there are strong reasons to doubt that either could take on this role – notwithstanding the fact that in 2022, then US president Joe Biden’s National Security Strategy called China: “The only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military and technological power to do so.” At times Biden’s successor, President Trump, has sounded almost jealous of the control China’s leaders exert over their national economy, and the fact they do not face elections and limits on their terms in office. But a one-party, authoritarian political system which lacks legal checks and balances is a key reason China will find it hard to gain the cultural and political dominance among democratic nations that is part of achieving world no.1 status – despite the influence it already wields in large parts of Asia and Africa. China still faces big economic challenges too. While it is already the global leader in manufactured goods (rapidly moving into hi-tech products) and the world’s largest exporter, its economy is still very unbalanced – with a much smaller consumer sector, a weak property market, many inefficient state industries that are highly indebted, and a relatively small financial sector restricted by state ownership. Nor does China possess a global currency, despite its (limited) attempts to make the renminbi a truly international currency. The Insights section is committed to high-quality longform journalism. Our editors work with academics from many different backgrounds who are tackling a wide range of societal and scientific challenges. As I found on a reporting trip to Shanghai in 2007 to investigate the effects of globalisation, there are also enormous differences between China’s prosperous coastal megacities – whose main thoroughfares rival New York and Paris – and the relative poverty in the interior, especially in rural areas. But nearly two decades on from that visit, with the country’s growth rate slowing, many university-educated young people are also finding it hard to find well-paid jobs now. Meanwhile Europe – the only other contender to take the US’s place as global no.1 – is deeply politically divided, with smaller, weaker economies to the east and south far more sceptical about the benefits of globalisation, and increasingly divided on issues such as migration and the Ukraine war. The challenges of achieving broad policy agreement among all member states, and the problem of who can speak for Europe, make it unlikely that the EU as currently constituted could initiate and enforce a new global world order on its own. The EU’s financial system also lacks the heft of the US’s. Although it has a common currency (the euro) managed by the European Central Bank, its financial system is far more fragmented. Banks are regulated nationally, and each country issues its own government bonds (although a few eurobonds now exist). This makes it hard for the euro to replace the dollar as a store of value, and reduces the incentive for foreigners to hold euros as an alternative reserve currency. Meanwhile, any future prospects of a renewal of US global leadership look similarly unpromising. Trump’s policy of cutting taxes while increasing the size of the US government debt – which now stands at US$38 trillion, or 120% of GDP – threatens both the stability of the world economy and the ability of the US to finance this mind-boggling deficit. Tellingly, the Trump administration shows no interest in reviving, or even engaging with, many of the international financial institutions which America once dominated, and which helped shape the world economic order – as US trade representative Jamieson Greer expressed disdainfully in the New York Times recently: Our current, nameless global order, which is dominated by the WTO and is notionally designed to pursue economic efficiency and regulate the trade policies of its 166 member countries, is untenable and unsustainable. The US has paid for this system with the loss of industrial jobs and economic security, and the biggest winner has been China. While the US is not, so far, withdrawing from the IMF, the Trump administration has urged it to call out China for running such a large trade surplus, while abandoning its concern about climate change. Greer concluded that the US has “subordinated our country’s economic and national security imperatives to a lowest common denominator of global consensus”. To understand the potential dangers ahead, we must go back more than a century to the last time there was no global hegemon. By the time the first world war officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles on June 28 1919, the international economic order had collapsed. Britain, world leader over the previous century, no longer possessed the economic, political or military clout to enforce its version of globalisation. The UK government, burdened by the huge debts it had taken out to finance the war effort, was forced to make major cuts in public spending. In 1931, it faced a sterling crisis: the pound had to be devalued as the UK exited from the gold standard for good, despite having yielded to the demands of international bankers to cut payments to the unemployed. This was a final sign that Britain had lost its dominant place in the world economic order. The 1930s were a time of deep political unease and unrest in Britain and many other countries. In 1936, unemployed workers from Jarrow, a town in north-east England with 70% unemployment after its shipyards closed, organised a non-political “hunger march” to London which became known as the Jarrow crusade. More than 200 men, dressed in their Sunday best, marched peacefully in step for over 200 miles, gaining great support along the way. Yet when they reached London, prime minister Stanley Baldwin ignored their petition – and the men were informed their dole money would be docked because they had been unavailable for work over the past fortnight. Europe was also facing a severe economic crisis. After Germany’s government refused to pay the reparations agreed in the 1919 Versailles treaty, saying they would bankrupt its economy, the French army occupied the German industrial heartland of the Ruhr and German workers went on strike, supported by their government. The ensuing struggle fuelled hyperinflation in Germany. By November 1923, it took 200,000 million marks to buy a loaf of bread, and the savings and pensions of the German middle class were wiped out. That month, Adolf Hitler made his first attempt to seize power in the failed “Beer hall putsch” in Munich. In contrast, across the Atlantic, the US was enjoying a period of postwar prosperity, with a booming stock market and explosive growth of new industries such as car manufacturing. But despite emerging as the world’s strongest economic power, having financed much of the Allied war effort, it was unwilling to grasp the reins of global economic leadership. The Republican US Congress, having blocked President Woodrow Wilson’s plan for a League of Nations, instead embraced isolationism and washed its hands of Europe’s problems. The US refused to cancel or even reduce the war debts owed it by the Allied nations, who eventually repudiated their debts. In retaliation, the US Congress banned all American banks from lending money to these so-called allies. Then, in 1929, the affluent American “jazz age” came to an abrupt halt with a stock market crash that wiped off half its value. The country’s largest manufacturer, Ford, closed its doors for a year and laid off all its workers. With a quarter of the nation unemployed, long lines for soup kitchens were seen in every city, while those who had been evicted camped out wherever they could – including in New York’s Central Park, renamed “Hooverville” after the hapless US president of that time, Herbert Hoover. In rural areas where the collapse in agricultural prices meant farmers could no longer make a living, armed farmers stopped food and milk trucks and destroyed their contents in a vain attempt to limit supply and raise prices. By March 1933, as President Franklin D. Roosevelt took office, the entire US banking system had ground to a standstill, with no one able to withdraw money from their bank account. With its focus on this devastating Great Depression, the US refused to get involved in attempts at international economic cooperation. With no notice, Roosevelt withdrew from the 1933 London Conference which had been called to stabilise the world’s currencies – sending a message denouncing “the old fetishes of the so-called international bankers”. With the US following the UK off the gold standard, the resulting currency wars exacerbated the crisis and further weakened European economies. As countries reverted to mercantilist policies of protectionism and trade wars, world trade shrank dramatically. The situation became even worse in central Europe, where the collapse of the huge Credit-Anstalt bank in Austria in 1931 reverberated around the region. In Germany, as mass unemployment soared, centrist parties were squeezed and armed riots broke out between communist and fascist supporters. When the Nazis came to power, they introduced a policy of autarky, cutting economic ties with the west to build up their military machine. The economic rivalries and antagonisms which weakened western economies paved the way for the rise of fascism in Germany. In some sense, Hitler – an admirer of the British empire – aspired to be the next hegemonic economic as well as military power, creating his own empire by conquering and ruthlessly exploiting the resources of the rest of Europe. Nearly a century later, there are some disturbing parallels with that interwar period. Like America after the first world war, Trump insists that countries the US has supported militarily now owe it money for this protection. He wants to encourage currency wars by devaluing the dollar, and raise protectionist barriers to protect domestic industry. The 1920s was also a time when the US sharply limited immigration on eugenic grounds, only allowing it from northern European countries which (the eugenicists argued) would not “pollute the white race”. Clearly, Trump does not view the lack of international cooperation that could amplify the damaging economic effects of a stock or bond market crash as a problem that should concern him. And in today’s unstable world, for all the US’s past failings as a global leader, that is a very worrying proposition. Once again, the rules of the international order are breaking down. While it is possible that Trump’s approach will not be fully adopted by his successor in the White House, the direction of travel in the US will almost certainly remain sceptical about the benefits of globalisation, with limited support for any worldwide economic rules or initiatives. We see similar scepticism about the benefits of globalisation emerging in other countries, amid the rise of rightwing populist parties in much of Europe and South America – many backed by Trump. Fuelling these parties’ support are growing concerns about income inequality, slow growth and immigration which are not being addressed by the current political system – and all of which would be exacerbated by the onset of a new global economic crisis. With the global economy and financial system far bigger than ever before, a new crisis could be even more severe than the one that occurred in 2008, when the failure of the banking system left the world teetering on the brink of collapse. The scale of this crisis was unprecedented, but key US and UK government officials moved boldly and swiftly. As a BBC reporter in Washington, I attended the House of Representatives’ Financial Services Committee hearing three days after Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, paralysing the global financial system, to find out the administration’s response. I remember the stunned look on the face of the committee’s chairman, Barney Frank, when he asked US Treasury secretary Hank Paulson and US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke how much money they might need to stabilise the situation: “Let’s start with US$1 trillion,” Bernanke replied coolly. “But we have another US$2 trillion on our balance sheet if we need it.” Shortly afterwards, the US Congress approved a US$700 billion rescue package. While the global economy has still not fully recovered from this crisis, it could have been far worse – possibly as bad as the 1930s – without such intervention. Around the world, governments ended up pledging US$11 trillion to guarantee the solvency of their banking systems, with the UK government putting up a sum equivalent to the country’s entire yearly GDP. But it was not just governments. At the G20 summit in London in April 2009, a new US$1.1 trillion fund was set up by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to advance money to countries that were getting into financial difficulty. The G20 also agreed to impose tougher regulatory standards for banks and other financial institutions that would apply globally, to replace the weak regulation of banks that had been one of the main causes of the crisis. As a reporter at this summit, I recall widespread excitement and optimism that the world was finally working together to tackle its global problems, with the host prime minister, Gordon Brown, briefly glowing in the limelight as organiser of that summit. Behind the scenes, the US Federal Reserve had also been working to contain the crisis by quietly passing on to the world’s other leading central banks nearly US$600 billion in “currency swaps” to ensure they had the dollars they needed to bail out their own banking systems. The Bank of England secretly lent UK banks £100 billion to ensure they didn’t collapse, although two of the four major banks, Royal Bank of Scotland (now NatWest) and Lloyds, ultimately had to be nationalised (to different extents) to keep the financial system stable. However, these rescue packages for banks, while much needed to stabilise the global economy, did not extend to many of the victims of the crash – such as the 12 million US households whose homes were now worth less than the mortgage they had taken out to pay for them, or the 40% of households who experienced financial distress during the 18 months after the crash. And the ramifications of the crisis were even greater for those living in developing countries. A few months after the 2008 financial crisis began, I travelled to Zambia, an African country totally dependent on copper exports for its foreign exchange. I visited the Luanshya copper mine near Ndola in the country’s copper belt. With demand for copper (used mainly in construction and car manufacturing) collapsing, all the copper mines had closed. Their workers, in one of the few well-paid jobs in Zambia, were forced to leave their comfortable company homes and return to sharing with their relatives in Lusaka without pay. Zambia’s government was forced to shut down its planned poverty reduction plan, which was to be funded by mining profits. The collapse in exports also damaged the Zambian currency, which dropped sharply. This hit the country’s poorest people hard as it raised the price of food, most of which was imported. I also visited a flower farm near Lusaka, where Dutch expats Angelique and Watze Elsinga had been growing roses for export for over a decade – employing more than 200 workers who were given housing and education. As the market for Valentine’s Day roses collapsed, their bankers, Barclays South Africa, suddenly ordered them to immediately repay all their loans, forcing them to sell their farm and dismiss their workers. Ultimately, it took a US$3.9 billion loan from the IMF and World Bank to stabilise Zambia’s economy. Should another global financial crisis hit, it is hard to see the Trump administration (and others that follow) being as sympathetic to the plight of developing countries, or allowing the Federal Reserve to lend major sums to foreign central banks – unless it is a country politically aligned with Trump, such as Argentina. Least likely of all is the idea of Trump working with other countries to develop a global trillion-dollar rescue package to help save the world economy. Rather, there is a real worry that reckless actions by the Trump administration – and weak global regulation of financial markets – could trigger the next global financial crisis. Economic historians agree that financial crises are endemic in the history of global capitalism, and they have been increasing in frequency since the “hyper-globalisation” of the 1970s. From Latin America’s debt crisis in the 1980s to the Asia currency crisis in the late 1990s and the US dotcom stock market collapse in the early 2000s, crises have regularly devastated economies and regions around the world. Today, the greatest risk is the collapse of the US Treasury bond market, which underpins the global financial system and is involved in 70% of global financial transactions by banks and other financial institutions. Around the world, these institutions have long regarded the US bond market, worth over $30 trillion, as a safe haven, because these “debt securities” are backed by the US central bank, the Federal Reserve. Increasingly, the unregulated “shadow banking system” – a sector now larger than regulated global banks – is deeply involved in the bond market. Non-bank financial institutions such as private equity, hedge funds, venture capital and pension funds are largely unregulated and, unlike banks, are not required to hold reserves. Bond market jitters are already unnerving global financial markets, which fear its unravelling could precipitate a banking crisis on the scale of 2008 – with highly leveraged transactions by these non-bank financial institutions leaving them exposed. Buyers of US bonds are also troubled by the Trump administration’s plan to raise the US deficit even higher to pay for tax cuts – with the national debt now forecast to rise to 134% of US GDP by 2035, up from 120% in 2025. Should this lead to a widespread refusal to buy more US bonds among jittery investors, their value would collapse and interest rates – both in the US and globally – would soar. The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, recently warned that the situation has “worrying echoes of the 2008 financial crisis”, while the head of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, said her worries about the collapse of private credit markets sometimes keep her awake at night. A bad situation would grow even worse if problems in the bond market precipitate a sharp decline in the value of the dollar. The world’s “anchor currency” would no longer be seen as a safe store of value – leading to more withdrawals of funds from the US Treasury bond market, where many foreign governments hold their reserves. A weaker dollar would also make imported goods more expensive for US consumers, while potentially boosting the country’s exports. This is precisely the course of action advocated by Stephen Miran, chair of the US president’s Council of Economic Advisors – who Trump appears to want to be the next head of the Federal Reserve. One example of what could happen if bond markets become destabilised occurred when the shortest-lived prime minister in UK history, Liz Truss, announced huge unfunded tax cuts in her 2022 budget, causing the value of UK gilts (the equivalent of US Treasury bonds) to plummet as interest rates spiked. Within days, the Bank of England was forced to put up an emergency £60 billion rescue fund to avoid major UK pension funds collapsing. In the case of a US bond market crash, however, there are growing fears that the US government would be unable – and unwilling – to step in to mitigate such damage. Just as worrying would be a crash of the US stock market – which, by historic standards, is currently vastly overvalued. Huge recent increases in the US stock market’s overall value have been driven almost entirely by the “magnificent seven” hi-tech companies, which alone make up a third of its total value. If their big bet on artificial intelligence is not as lucrative as they claim, or is overshadowed by the success of China’s AI systems, a sharp downturn, similar to the dotcom crash of 2000-02, could well occur. Read more: What 2,000 years of Chinese history reveals about today's AI-driven technology panic – and the future of inequality Jamie Dimon, head of the US’s biggest bank JPMorgan Chase, has said he is “far more worried than other [experts]” about a serious market correction, which he warned could come in the next six months to two years. Big tech executives have been overoptimistic before. Reporting from Silicon Valley in 2001 as the dotcom bubble was bursting, I was struck by the unshakeable belief of internet startup CEOs that their share prices could only go up. Furthermore, their companies’ high stock valuations had allowed them to take over their competitors, thus limiting competition – just as companies such as Google and Meta (Facebook) have since used their highly valued shares to purchase key assets and potential rivals including YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram and DeepMind. History suggests this is always bad for the economy in the long run. With the business and financial worlds now ever more closely linked, not only has the frequency of financial crises increased in the last half-century, each crisis has become more interconnected. The 2008 global financial crisis showed how dangerous this can be: a global banking crisis triggered stock market falls, collapses in the value of weak currencies, a debt crisis in developing countries – and ultimately, a global recession that has taken years to recover from. The IMF’s latest financial stability report summarised the situation in worrying terms, highlighting “elevated” stability risks as a result of “stretched asset valuations, growing pressure in sovereign bond markets, and the increasing role of non-bank financial institutions. Despite its deep liquidity, the global foreign exchange market remains vulnerable to macrofinancial uncertainty.” I believe we may be entering a new era of sustained financial chaos during which the seeds sown by the death of globalisation – and Trump’s response to it – finally shatter the world economic and political order established after the second world war. Trump’s high and erratically applied tariffs – aimed most strongly at China – have already made it difficult to reconfigure global supply chains. Even more worrying could be the struggle over the control of key strategic raw materials like the rare earth minerals needed for hi-tech industries, with China banning their export and the US threatening 100% tariffs in return (as well as hoping to take over Greenland, with its as-yet-untapped supply of some of these minerals). This conflict over rare earths, vital for the computer chips needed for AI, could also threaten the market value of high-flying tech stocks such as Nvidia, the first company to exceed US$4 trillion in value. The battle for control of critical raw materials could escalate. There is a danger that in some cases, trade wars might become real wars – just as they did in the former era of mercantilism. Many recent and current regional conflicts, from the first Iraq war aimed at the conquest of the oilfields of Kuwait, to the civil war in Sudan over control of the country’s goldmines, are rooted in economic conflicts. The history of globalisation over the past four centuries suggests that the presence of a global superpower – for all its negative sides – has brought a degree of economic stability in an uncertain world. In contrast, a key lesson of history is that a return to policies of mercantilism – with countries struggling to seize key natural resources for themselves and deny them to their rivals – is most likely a recipe for perpetual conflict. But this time around, in a world full of 10,000 nuclear weapons, miscalculations could be fatal if trust and certainty are undermined. The challenges ahead are immense – and the weakness of international institutions, the limited visions of most governments and the alienation of many of their citizens are not optimistic signs.

Title: Nvidia Becomes the First Company to Hit $5 Trillion Market Cap
URL: https://gizmodo.com/nvidia-becomes-the-first-company-to-hit-5-trillion-market-cap-2000678694
Time Published: 2025-10-29T14:46:21Z

Reading time: Reading time 3 minutes Nvidia just became the first company in the world to be worth $5 trillion, just four months after it made history by hitting a $4 trillion market capitalization. The company owed that last bump to a series of high-profile announcements that CEO Jensen Huang made at the first Washington D.C. edition of its conference, GTC, and the raging hype cycle around companies working in AI. On Tuesday, Huang announced that Nvidia would partner with: The company also delighted investors when Huang announced that Nvidia is expecting half a trillion dollars in orders for its Blackwell and Rubin chips through next year. Also helping Nvidia’s case is its close ties to the Trump administration, which was on full display at the GTC in D.C. Huang spent a good chunk of his time praising the administration and the President personally, saying that “no one works harder” than him. Huang also told the crowd that he is jetting off to South Korea to meet the President on his Asia diplomacy tour. Trump is supposed to have a key trade meeting with China’s Xi Jinping in South Korea, and the outcome of that meeting is likely to be of great concern to Nvidia. Perhaps the only thing that has been weighing on Nvidia in the market the past few months has been the trade dispute between the U.S. and China. Nvidia has been caught in the crossfire of that dispute many times. The tech giant is banking on a trade deal that would allow it to resume selling its chips in China, in what was once one of its strongest markets. Gaining Trump’s confidence is key to doing that. The market value of the biggest names in AI is off the charts, and Nvidia leads the charge. There are only three companies in the world that are worth more than $4 trillion, and they are all tech giants buoyed by the AI trade. Microsoft was the second company to cross the benchmark after Nvidia in July, and Apple became the third yesterday. This meteoric rise in value only makes fears of an AI bubble worse. Not only are most experts raising concerns that AI companies are overvalued, but their outsized influence on the market and the U.S. economy makes any downturn correction dangerous. The Bank of England warned earlier this month that “equity market valuations appear stretched” for AI companies, stock market price valuations were comparable to the peak of the dot-com bubble, and that the market share of the top five members of the S&P 500 (Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta) was at its highest concentration in 50 years. The U.S. market is banking on an unprecedented boom in AI demand, and Nvidia is considered the darling of the AI trade. They are in charge of supplying the chips that are at the core of this infrastructure build-out. But if demand does not shape up as expected or if the build-out runs into any material bottlenecks, like supply chain problems or a lack of energy and resources, then all this valuation (and everything attached to it) is at risk of coming crashing down.

BCA Research said it was looking for one warning sign in particular when it comes to the AI boom, which has sent tech stocks into stratospheric territory as companies pour billions into AI-related investments. According to Peter Berezin, the chief global strategist at the research firm, it could be time for investors to get out when AI sees a "metaverse moment" — a scenario in which a large AI firm announces "even more capex" and sees its stock price drop, he wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. "If that were to happen, it would be time to run for the hills," Berezin said. "Until then, we are content to maintain only a slightly below-benchmark allocation to stocks on a 12-month horizon," he added. The metaverse embodied the market zeitgeist and drew billions in investment several years ago. The concept eventually faded out of popularity, causing firms like Meta to eventually report billions in losses. Some observers have drawn parallels to the AI craze, which has seen large tech firms pouring buckets into chips and data centers while monetization plans remain unclear. Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Google — four companies at the center of the AI trade — could spend as much as $320 billion on capex primarily related to AI infrastructure this year, according to an analysis of financial statements by Business Insider. Tech stocks have already flashed several warning signs recently, Berezin said. For one, the free cash flow of the so-called hyperscalers — large tech companies spending big on AI — has fallen in recent months, a possible sign that balance sheets at those companies are weaker. That was similar to what happened to telecom stocks prior to the bursting of the dot-com bubble, Berezin said. Second, speculative stocks that have been buoyed by the AI trade have sold off in recent weeks. That's another worrying sign for the AI trade, Berezin added, pointing to the recent decline in quantum computing, rare earth, and nuclear energy stocks. Talk of a stock market bubble has grown on Wall Street as investors as investors take stock of enormous AI-fueled gains in recent years. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 is up 135% over the last five years. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF, which tracks the seven companies at the heart of the AI trade, is up 172% since its inception. Jump to

Title: Federal Reserve monetary policy statement today: 25 bps rate cut a done deal? what time will Jerome Powell announce the Fed decision and how will the U.S. stock market react?

Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce a 25 basis point (0.25%) rate cut today, lowering the federal funds rate target range to 3.75%–4.00%. This decision is nearly a done deal as the Fed navigates uncertainties from a weakening labor market and ongoing federal government shutdown that limits economic data. Jerome Powell, the Fed Chair, is scheduled to announce the decision at 2:00 PM Eastern Time today, Wednesday, October 29, 2025. The Fed is likely to remain cautious in its guidance, keeping future rate moves open, as officials are divided on the pace of cuts. There may be some dissent with at least one official favoring a larger cut of 50 basis points.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Nvidia became the first company ever to reach a $5 trillion market capitalization at the open on Wednesday morning. The tech giant's stock was up around 4.4% to almost $210 in the opening minutes of trading, giving it a valuation of roughly $5.1 trillion. The historic valuation milestone was reached after CEO Jensen Huang said Tuesday that the company expects $500 billion in AI chip orders over the next four years and plans to build seven AI supercomputers for the US Department of Energy. Nvidia's upward move was also bolstered by President Donald Trump saying in a Wednesday press conference in South Korea that he could discuss Nvidia's Blackwell chips with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in a meeting on Thursday. Nvidia also gained after a Tuesday announcement that it would invest $1 billion in Nokia to develop 6G technology. That news pushed the Finnish telecommunications' stock up to its highest level in almost a decade. The chip firm's stock has risen more than 50% so far in 2025 and has climbed a staggering 1,500% in the past five years. Nvidia's arrival at a $5 trillion valuation comes just a day after Apple hit a $4 trillion market capitalization, joining Microsoft and Nvidia in the exclusive club. Apple hit $4 trillion for the first time as the company's rally, driven by strong iPhone 17 sales, continued. Apple's share price was virtually unchanged at $269.68 at the open on Wednesday. "The Q3 earnings season will reach its apex this week with key reports due from Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta on Wednesday as well as Apple and Amazon on Thursday," Jim Reid, head of macro and thematic research at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a note on Monday. "The five biggest companies in the world after Nvidia now make up $15tn in total market capitalization or 25% of the S&P 500." Jump to

Business NEW YORK :Spending updates this week from U.S. megacap companies that are investing massively in artificial intelligence could jolt the AI trade that has been a primary driver of the record-breaking U.S. stocks rally. Capital spending is a crucial component of the AI trade that has propelled equities following the launch of AI assistant ChatGPT in November 2022. With the benchmark S&P 500 up about 17 per cent year-to-date and 90 per cent since the bull market began just over three years ago, investors are on guard for any weakness while wary of parallels with the dot-com market bubble 25 years ago. The rally has been led by a select group, including chipmaker Nvidia, which has symbolized the enthusiasm with its market-leading AI chips and mammoth share-price gains that have made it the world's largest company by market value, on the cusp of an unprecedented $5 trillion. Investment by the biggest companies, including Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Amazon, serves to build out the infrastructure that supports the burgeoning industry while signaling confidence in the theme, investors said.

Title: The Ultimate 100 Profitable Niches For Affiliate Marketing To Monetize In 2026 - NowG.net
URL: https://www.nowg.net/top-profitable-niches-for-affiliate-marketing/
Time Published: 2025-10-29T10:00:09Z
Full Content:
Last Updated on October 29, 2025 by Caesar Fikson Profitable niches for affiliate marketing in 2026 reward operators and seasoned affiliates who treat content like a product and funnels like software. We at NowG mapped the niches where budgets are growing, payouts stay sane, and buyer intent is measurable—especially across iGaming, fintech/crypto, B2B SaaS, and high-velocity consumer tech. You’ll see exactly why a niche pays, who to promote, and how to position it so your EPC doesn’t vanish after week two. Quick lens: we prioritize niches with rising TAM, resilient commissions, clean cookies/server-to-server tracking, and strong second-order revenue (upsell, retention, or LTV-backed CPL/CPA). We’re publishing the first 50 niches here; if you want Part 2 (51–100), say the word and we’ll roll it out the same way. 💡 Pro tip: Structure pages as “jobs to be done,” not encyclopedia entries: Choose A vs B → Set up → First win → Level up. Your conversion lift will be… not subtle. Table of Contents For gaming-savvy readers, these are the engines of high-velocity CPA/Hybrid revenue. We favor regulated brands and tools that make bettors/casino players smarter and stickier. B2B payouts are steadier and upgrades extend LTV. Perfect for comparison pages, ROI calculators, and “from template to result” tutorials. Growth persists where outcomes are trackable (weight, HRV, sleep). Pair programs with responsible, evidence-led content and clear disclaimers. Have you considered the downstream impact of stacking niches that naturally cross-sell? That’s where the margin lives. Wallet → exchange → tax software. Sportsbook → odds tool → bankroll tracker. Hosting → email → analytics. We’ve watched this triple ARPU without adding a single new traffic source. 💡 Pro tip: Build “starter bundles” with two-step CTAs (e.g., “Get the wallet → set up the exchange”). Bundle bonuses beat single-program coupons in both conversion and retention. Picture an affiliate team churning out single-product reviews. Traffic looks fine; EPC doesn’t. We at NowG regroup the site into five stacks: Crypto Onboarding, iGaming Toolkit, Creator Stack, Home Security, and Sleep & Recovery. Each stack has one “choose” page, one “set up” page, and one “first win” page. We rewrite CTAs for sequences, wire basic webhooks into a sheet, and measure mission completion instead of raw clicks. Thirty days later: fewer pages, more revenue—session depth +17%, second-conversion +22%, refunds lower. The products didn’t change. The architecture did. Try NowG’s free tools to map your stacks, score offers, and sanity-check time-to-first-conversion before you scale spend. Profitable niches for affiliate marketing keep the lights on when algorithms wobble. We at NowG finished mapping the second half of the list—fifty more niches where commissions are sane, intent is measurable, and the onramp to revenue is short. As before, you’ll get why each niche pays, the best-fit affiliate programs to consider (examples), and the winning angle that turns clicks into money. Lens unchanged: rising budgets, recurring or LTV-backed payouts, clean data access, and obvious cross-sells. Treat these as modules—build stacks and your ARPU compounds. 💡 Pro tip: Pair travel with finance stacks (cards, insurance, lounge access). One “How to build a points-friendly itinerary” guide can monetize three programs instead of one. Have you considered the downstream impact of adding a sustainability pillar to an existing home niche? Conversions rise when you couple cost savings with impact—two reasons to click, not one. 💡 Pro tip: Beauty and pet niches thrive on before/after and progress artifacts. Build a simple “progress log” printable and your retention will quietly climb. Frustrating when carts are full and conversions stall? In home/outdoor, onboarding content beats price cuts. Show the first weekend with the product and buyers stop procrastinating. 💡 Pro tip: Services convert on certainty. Publish response-time SLAs, pricing ranges, and “what happens after you click” flows. Your lead quality will jump. Don’t spin up 50 new categories. Build stacks around intent: Travel Stack, Green Home Stack, Pets Stack, Home/DIY Stack, and Career Stack. Each gets a “choose” page (A vs B), a “set up” page (first week), and a “first win” page (proof of outcome). Ship those three and your site becomes a product, not an encyclopedia. Here’s the bottom line: markets shift; intent doesn’t. If your pages move people from interest → action → result, the commission model barely matters—CPA, hybrid, rev share all work when the user gets a win fast. Try NowG’s free tools to map stacks, model commissions, and benchmark event latency before you scale traffic. Pick niches that cross-sell naturally with what you already rank for. Then prioritize the ones with recurring or LTV-backed payouts and vendors that expose hourly stats or webhooks. Speed to first win beats volume. One decision page (A vs B), one setup guide (first week), and one first-win tutorial per stack. Add a simple calculator or checklist to each. That trio outperforms 10 generic reviews. Limit yourself to stacks, not categories. Publish only pages that move users along the job-to-be-done path—everything else is backlog until the stack monetizes. Most are global with GEO-tuned providers. For leadgen (HVAC, pools, legal), build city/state landing pages and route leads to the right partner. Time-to-first-conversion, second-conversion rate (cross-sell), refund/chargeback rate, and 30/60/90-day EPC. If TTFX falls and 2nd-conversion rises, keep investing. Use iGaming for high-velocity CPA/Hybrid revenue (pair with odds tools and payment rails). Use finance to stabilize cashflow (cards, wallets, tax). They complement each other when sequenced well. We prioritized rising budgets, resilient commissions, and programs with solid data access (hourly stats or webhooks). We also weighted niches that cross-sell well—stacking raises ARPU without new traffic. Do both. Start with one niche you can own, then expand into adjacent products to create a stack (e.g., wallet → exchange → tax). Stacks compound LTV. Decision pages (A vs B), setup guides, and first-win tutorials. Add calculators and checklists to move users from interest to action quickly. Yes, but shadow-model hybrid for 6–8 weeks to reveal true LTV by GEO and to avoid overpaying for bonus hunters.

Title: NZ sharemarket edges higher as NZME lifts earnings guidance – Market close

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. NZME's chief executive Michael Boggs has upgraded its financial forecasts and says revenue is better than expected. Photo / Michael Craig The New Zealand sharemarket rose slightly today after a strong lead-in from the US markets. The S&P/NZX 50 Index closed up 0.05% or 6.553 points at 13,409.21 after 30.7 million shares worth $123 million were traded. The S&P/NZX 20 index was up 0.07%, closing at 7676.73 points, while the S&P/NZX 10 index ended the day at 12,764.34 after rising 0.19%. There were 72 gainers on the main board and 59 decliners. Hamilton Hindin Greene investment adviser Jeremy Sullivan said the market was treading water today. “The index did follow in kind with US markets hitting record highs. “The latter part of our session we came back somewhat,” Sullivan said. “Looking ahead we’ve got a big couple of days for earnings in the US, as well as the Fed, so that’s probably going to be the main macro story for the markets.” Five companies from the “Magnificent Seven” will report over the next day and a half, including Alphabet (Google), Meta (Facebook), Microsoft, Amazon and Apple. On the NZ sharemarket, NZME upgraded its financial forecasts and said its revenue was likely to be better than expected. The media company told the NZX this morning it expected operating earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) for 2025 to be between $59m and $62m. That was up on earlier guidance of between $57m and $59m. “NZME is heavily reliant on ad spend and has done a bit of cost-cutting as well. There’s some positive momentum into FY26 for them, midpoint of their upgrade at 12% year on year,” Sullivan said. NZME’s share price rallied 6.67% or 7c to $1.12 after 900,674 shares changed hands on turnover worth $1m. Elsewhere, market minnow New Talisman Gold Mines’ share price rallied by 16.98% to $0.06 after the firm announced it had signed an agreement for the offtake of gold concentrate. However, the regulator swiftly applied a trading halt to the company after the update. “They said their announcement wasn’t price-sensitive, but their stock went up 17%. They said they were freezing it and were going to have a closer look at it. If the market thinks it’s price-sensitive, it probably should have been [treated as such].” Other movers today included Vista Group, which fell 3.91% or 11c to $2.70; A2 Milk, which rose 1.90% or 20c to $10.70; and Contact Energy, which fell 0.63% or 6c to $9.40. Sullivan said the lead-in from the US was interesting, particularly for the fact that it featured the widest ever divergence of companies on the S&P 500 in a positive day. “There were 102 that were positive, and 398 that were negative, and yet the market closed up. That’s the widest it’s ever been. Nvidia now makes up 8% of the S&P 500, the largest since General Motors in the 1970s. “Now when Nvidia moves, so does the market.” Wall Street stocks rose to fresh records again on Tuesday local time as a jump in artificial intelligence player Nvidia’s shares added to bullishness over easing trade tensions and market-friendly central bank policy. All three major US indices climbed to records for the third straight session, with Nvidia piling on about 5% as the chipmaker announced new ventures and chief executive Jensen Huang headlined a company event in Washington. Donald Trump is due to meet his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Thursday in South Korea – and rosy comments by the US President have fuelled optimism that the world’s two largest economies, China and the United States, can strike a deal to ease their trade war. – Additional reporting AFP Tom Raynel is a multimedia business journalist for the Herald, covering small business, retail and tourism.

This seven-day correction has put an end to one of the longest bull runs in the history of the precious metal. · With markets already factoring in another rate cut in December, traders are waiting for Fed Chair Jerome Powell to give them clues about the direction of monetary policy going forward. · Investors, however, kept an eye on developments on a possible trade deal between the US and China that would further reduce demand for safe havens. · A framework deal between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump is anticipated to be finalised. The pact aims to loosen China’s limitations on rare earth shipments and stop more US tariff rises. Technical Triggers · First target achieved in Gold at $3960 (~Rs 119,000), prices could consolidate here and then fall to $3850 (~Rs 117,000). · First target achieved in Silver at $46 (~Rs 140,000), prices could consolidate here and then fall to 45(~Rs 136,500). Puneet Singhania, Director at Master Trust Group As mutual fund houses resume investments in Silver ETFs, should investors consider taking a fresh entry? The lull in silver fund investments by mutual fund houses previously was spurred by supply inadequacies and high premiums on physical silver, now relaxed as global supply chains stabilize. Silver price has also corrected on its peak, creating a healthier entry point for long-term investors. Silver is unique because it can be utilized as a store of value, similar to gold, and it’s also a critical industrial metal that finds applications in semiconductors, electronics, solar panels, and electric vehicles. In the future, the structural demand for silver is set to continue being robust in the face of the global energy transition, increasing renewable capacity, and technological advancement. But investors should keep in mind that silver as a commodity is still a volatile and cyclical asset, which tends to react sharply to changes in global interest rates, inflation expectations, and industrial demand changes. Rather than attempting timing of entries, investors need to invest systematically in order to average out volatility and sharp corrections. How much allocation to Silver ETFs (as a percentage of the overall portfolio) would be advisable for investors as these units become more accessible? The entrance of Silver ETFs, thanks to the fund offerings from various Indian AMCs, opened a new avenue for the investors to invest in silver more comfortably. Nonetheless, the investors’ commitment to having a varied portfolio is still vital, as the precious metal generally experiences more volatility and cycles than investments in stocks or bonds. A diversified portfolio is one where silver exposure of 5-10% through ETFs or mutual funds is usually recommended. Given the nature of silver prices being so volatile, it is wise to adhere to SIPs (systematic investment plans) instead of taking all at once. This approach works by outputting the costs of buying and also cutting down on the risk of poor timing. Moreover, it is also important for the investors to keep an eye on the trading of ETFs at premium or discount prices before they invest since these aspects can have a big influence on the returns. All in all, Silver is an investment category that is very much a part of the diversification and inflation-hedging worthiness. What strategy should existing Silver ETF investors adopt in the current market scenario? For investors already holding silver, staying patient is crucial in the current market. The long-term fundamentals of the metal remain strong due to its steady structural demand. Silver surged to its historic highs in 2025 before correcting sharply, and while Indian ETF premiums have normalized post-Diwali, supply-demand tightness continues. Since silver’s growth story is still intact, investors should view their investments with a long-term holding perspective rather than responding to short-term corrections. With its widespread use in electronics, solar energy systems, batteries, and semiconductors, the metal is crucial to today’s technologically driven world. The technology evolution and the move to using renewable sources of energy keep the silver demand steady, thus reinforcing its long-term price trend. For investors, opting for a staggered investment strategy over gold/silver ETFs or mutual fund is an excellent way to cope with the volatility and possible corrections after such a steep rally, besides seizing the long-term trend. Silver ETFs have delivered strong returns so far. As geopolitical tensions ease and supply-demand concerns persist, what is the outlook for silver and silver-backed assets in the near term and long term? This year, silver has been a very profitable investment, which can be attributed to the strong demand from both industries and investors. Currently, both physical silver and ETFs are experiencing the same supply-demand pressure with demand being the reason for premium trade due to the limitations. Although the trading volumes may be reduced temporarily due to the calming of geopolitical tensions, the fundamentals of the metal are still very strong. Silver is still a key component in the green technologies area, which includes solar panels, EVs, and advanced electronics, so the industrial demand is constant. The prices of silver are backed by the structural demand which the global production cannot meet. The strong demand for this precious metal is a fact that is supported by the market speculations throughout the whole short-term period. Pullbacks in the price of silver should be considered to be the normal phases of a broader uptrend and not a ground for worry by the investors. India’s industrial growth slowed to 3% in H1FY26, but GST reforms, festive demand, and easing inflation may drive a rebound in the second half, says Bank of Baroda. Raymond Lifestyle has appointed Vishal Raigagla as Chief Financial Officer of the company w.e.f. October 29, 2025. Japanese auto major Honda Motor has said that India is the third most important market for the company after the US and Japan.

Nifty Bank predictions for October 29, 2025, suggest a potential rally to 58,850 with strategic trading insights. AMC stocks plunge as SEBI proposes mutual fund fee overhaul, with HDFC AMC suffering the largest drop of 6.3%. Shree Cement shares rise 0.91% amid mixed brokerage ratings despite strong quarterly results and valuation concerns. Iris Clothings announced implementation of SAP Business One. The company has transitioned from its earlier ERP system, Tally, to SAP Business One, a globally recognized enterprise resource planning (ERP) platform. Shares flat on the NSE at Rs 32.46 Driven by its core engineering and construction segments and a healthy project pipeline in the Middle East, Larsen & Toubro (L&T) is expected to post a double-digit growth in revenue in Q2 FY26. Raymond Lifestyle reported consolidated net profit for the quarter ended September 2025 at Rs 75.19 crore (78% growth) from Rs 42.18 crore in the same quarter last year. Cyclone Montha weakens into a Cyclonic Storm near Machilipatnam; APDMA warns of continued rain, gusty winds, and flooding risk across coastal Andhra. Vikram Subburaj, CEO, Giottus.com Bitcoin fell back below $113,000 even as U.S. equities notched fresh records to underscore a widening gap between traditional and digital risk assets. A rotation into AI-heavy stocks after Nvidia’s 5% rise appeared to siphon liquidity from crypto and kept bids subdued. Despite recovering from the October 10–11 shock, resistance above $116,000 persists with limited follow-through from buyers. Analysts flag the short-term holder cost basis near $113.6k as a key pivot. Any failure to hold that level could extend the retracement toward sub-$108k. This would imply a deeper test of structural support. Macro dynamics remain in charge. Equity gains reflect optimism ahead of this week’s US Federal Reserve meeting and Big Tech results. The same liquidity rotation is but weighing on digital assets. A 25 bps US Fed cut is widely anticipated and market reaction will hinge less on the move itself and more on whether Chair Powell signals a pause to quantitative tightening. In the near term, rising Treasury yields and renewed flows into equities imply capital is clustering in safer or higher-performing sectors. This keeps crypto in consolidation rather than a full-blown recovery. Altcoins tracked Bitcoin lower. Ethereum slipped 3% to just under $4,000, while Solana and Litecoin fell nearly 3% to unwind much of their early-week gains. The debut of new spot ETFs for Solana, Hedera, and Litecoin did little to lift sentiment as traders prioritised risk management over chasing catalysts. Sui (SUI) dropped 4% to $2.50 after a late-day breakdown, with ~2.7 million tokens reportedly changing hands in a single minute. The abrupt volume spike alongside a sharp price slide points to larger holders offloading into thin liquidity. This leaves the token vulnerable to further downside if follow-through buying does not emerge. Overall, the tape still looks like post-October digestion. It is strong enough to avoid decisive breakdowns but lacks the conviction to sustain rallies until macro clarity and fresh capital return.” Jefferies on Shree Cement Recommendation Buy; Target Price ₹33420, Earlier Target ₹35150 Miss on higher cost;

Given the sheer extent of the consultative paper and related documents, we are still in process of grasping the material to evaluate the likely impact. However, four key proposed regulations are noteworthy from a TER and AMC revenue standpoint. ▪ With an objective to rationalize cost for unitholder, additional expense of 5bps that was allowed in equity TER has been removed from the draft MF Regulations. PL View: This would be a negative for AMCs as 5bps would be directly reduced from equity TER ▪ To pass on any change in statutory levy in future, TER limits are revised downward to the extent of GST on all expenses other than MF fees. Hence, across slabs TER has been proposed to be reduced by 10bps PL View: While the wordings are a bit ambiguous this may mean that TER will have to exclude the GST impact which was roughly 10bps. Assuming that statutory levies would be permitted over and above the TER limit, this may not have a material adverse impact. ▪ To protect investor interest and ensure that expenses are charged only once, brokerage has been revised from 12 bps to 2 bps for cash transactions and 5 bps to 1 bps for derivative transactions. All other execution-related transaction costs may be charged on actual basis. PL View: As per SEBI, since AMCs already charge an MF fees, additional brokerage over and above 2bps would lead to a dual impact on customer. This would certainly be negative for brokers. ▪ A provision enabling TER to be charged based on performance has been introduced and same shall be voluntary for AMCs. A detailed framework in this regard shall be finalized separately in consultation with stakeholders. PL View: AMCs would be allowed to charge additional performance-based TER which would be a positive, increasing revenue; final guidelines are awaited. Sector/stock impact: We expect AMCs may pass on the 5bps equity TER cut to other industry participants however assuming no pass through, core earnings for ICICI Pru, HDFCAMC, NAM, ABSL AMC and UTIAM would be affected by 8.0-9.0%. The impact would be more severe for CRAMC at ~22% due to ~90% equity share. This negative effect has been partly neutralised by proposing a performance-based TER (framework to be finalised). Reduction of the cash brokerage from 12bps to 5bps and derivative brokerage from 2bps to 1bp would adversely affect brokers Gold stabilizes at $3,950 an ounce amid expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut after a three-day decline.

Title: AI monetization and capex in focus for Meta as Wall Street heads toward Q3 earnings

Mark Zuckerberg explained Meta's plan to spend more than ever on AI after the company announced earnings that were dragged down by a $15.9 billion tax charge. The social media giant and AI hyperscaler reported revenue of $51.24 billion, beating Wall Street's estimates of $49.5 billion. Earnings per share came in at $6.03, compared to estimates for $6.72. The stock fell more than 9% in after-hours trading. Meta said that its AI infrastructure spending will continue to rise, and that 2026 cap-ex will be "notably larger" than 2025. On a call with analysts, Zuckerberg said that a "significantly larger investment" in compute is "very likely to be a profitable thing." In the "very worst case," he said, Meta will have pre-built capacity and will absorb the depreciation costs. Much of the call was spent discussing Meta's superintelligence lab — for which the company spent heavily to recruit talent — and its ability to monetize. Zuckerberg said that the lab's research enabled "new technological capabilities" that improved the company's products. Meta CFO Susan Li said that a number of "youth-related trials" slated for 2026 could also result in "a material loss." She also walked through the one-time $15.9 billion tax charge and said Meta expected its taxes to decrease in future years due to the Trump's Big Beautiful Bill Act. Catch up on the play-by-play from Meta's Q3 earnings call with analysts below: Zuckerberg closes out the call by saying that Meta is "seeing the returns" for AI in its core businesses, and that it gives the company "confidence" it should do more. "We want to make sure that we're not underinvesting," Zuckerberg says. Meta's stock is trading down around 8.5% as the analyst call concludes. "There's a lot of value to create with AI overall," Zuckerberg says. He says Nvidia has "extremely well-deserved success" in hardware, and that cloud partners are also finding lots of opportunity. AI app companies are "relatively small," he says, but there is a "huge opportunity." The technology industry has not seen this "rate of new capabilities," Zuckerberg says. New businesses can be built around these new capabilities, he adds. Zuckerberg says work on Meta's AI Ray-Ban and Oakley collaborations is going "very well" and will likely be a "very profitable investment" if strong sales continue. Some revenue will come from selling devices, and others will come from services on top of them, he says. The AI will become the "main thing" people are using the glasses for, Zuckerberg says. Meta CFO Susan Li says Advantage Plus ad tech improvements have led to a 14% lower cost-per-lead. Meta is working to broaden adoption of automated solutions, she adds. Advantage Plus is an "ongoing platform," she says. ARR for advertisers using automated options is $60 billion, and there's "room to continue growing that," she says. Zuckerberg says it's "valuable" that a lot of people use Meta's AI models, and that there's a clear correlation between model improvements and usage. He says that the Superintelligence Lab is the "highest talent density lab in the industry." The models will "improve monetization" by improving engagement and advertising, Zuckerberg says. Zuckerberg says research will enable "new technological capabilities" that will be useful in a variety of products, from an AI assistant to a business AI to feed rankings. The capabilities will also help build "new creative tools," Zuckerberg says. The "art of product development," Zuckerberg says, is figuring out which of these products will be useful. He expects an "exponential curve" in technological capabilities to come.

The capabilities will also help build "new creative tools," Zuckerberg says. The "art of product development," Zuckerberg says, is figuring out which of these products will be useful. He expects an "exponential curve" in technological capabilities to come. "I think being best in a given area will drive great returns," he adds. Zuckerberg says Meta is trying to "build novel capabilities," and is not interested in any "check the box" exercises. Meta is working on a foundation model, but also advancing its inference models, Li says. Even "small-scale improvements" like small ad improvements grow revenue in a meaningful way, she says. Zuckerberg says that there was no specific timing for new models or products from the superintelligence team to be announced on the call, but that he was "excited to share more." Mark Zuckerberg defends Meta's ballooning infrastructure costs, saying the company is intentionally "front-loading" compute investments to stay ahead in the race toward superintelligence. He tells analysts that even if Meta overbuilds its data center capacity, the downside would be limited. In the "very worst case," he says, the company would have simply "pre-built for a couple of years," absorbing the costs through depreciation while eventually growing into the extra capacity. Zuckerberg argues that the greater risk is underinvesting, noting that Meta's AI research, recommendation systems, and potential external compute offerings could all profitably use far more compute than the company currently has. They "continue to see improvements in usage" of Meta's AI, Zuckerberg says. Once they have "truly frontier models with novel capabilities," there is great opportunity, Zuckerberg says. He predicts that the ability to plug in "leading models" will lead to a large amount of use. More intelligent models will also improve the core business, Zuckerberg adds. "There's quite a bit more to do," he says. While the stock had ticked up slightly to be trading around -7% mid-way through the call, it's dipped back down after hours. A "significantly larger investment" in compute is "very likely to be a profitable thing," Zuckerberg says. Meta feels "pretty good" that it can convert any compute it doesn't need into more intelligence and better recommendations. Li says "we wish we have more capacity today than we do." A "significantly larger investment" in compute is "very likely to be a profitable thing," Zuckerberg says. Meta feels "pretty good" that it can convert any compute it doesn't need into more intelligence and better recommendations. Li says "we wish we have more capacity today than we do." Meta is trying to "plan ahead" to be able to meet necessary capacity in 2026, as well as 2027, and 2028, Li says. Their "foremost priority" is building the "compute that we need" to succeed in AI, Li says. There are "headwinds to the Quest headsets" since Meta does not have a new headset on the market this year, Li says. Meta is still expecting significant year-over-year growth in glasses in Q4, Li says. Li says that growth in CapEx is from all areas, including non-AI spend, but that AI needs are "growing the most." Li says that expenditures on ad ranking and performance efforts are paying off. There is "very strong year-over-year growth" in weighted conversions, she adds. Meta expects spending on AI talent to be one of its biggest cost drivers next year as it continues an aggressive hiring push. CFO Susan Li says employee compensation will be the company's second-largest contributor to expense growth in 2026, largely reflecting a full year of pay for AI specialists hired throughout 2025 and new technical recruits in priority areas. She says the increased payroll comes alongside rising infrastructure costs, as Meta's compute needs have "continued to expand meaningfully" and the company plans to "invest aggressively" in both its own data centers and third-party cloud capacity. Li says that, depending on the results, they may result in "a material loss." Meta expects that infrastructure costs will expand, Li says. They expect "invest aggressively to meet these needs," Meta's CFO says. She says it will put "upward pressure" on CapEx. Li says that advertising revenue will drive growth, partially offset by Reality Labs introducing new Quest devices. Meta lifted its CapEx outlook. Investments in ads and "organic engagement initiatives" will enable "strong revenue growth," Li says. The staged data centers will allow Meta to build capacity quickly in future years "as we need it," Li says. Meta continues to observe "performance improvements" as it combines ad models, Li says. Meta is also piloting a new runtime ads ranking model, she says. It has driven a more than 2% lift in Instagram conversions, she says. Meta has more generative AI features for advertisers, Li says, including AI-generated music. These tools "drive increased performance," she says. Li says that global time spent was up on both Facebook and Instagram in the US thanks to video. Meta is developing foundational ranking models to yield more relevant recommendations, Li says. Users have created 20 billion images with Meta AI products, Li says. Since creating the Vibes AI feed, media creation on the Meta AI app has increased tenfold. Meta's headcount as of September 30 was 78,450, representing an 8% year-over-year increase. The CFO says that Meta was hiring in areas like monetization, infrastructure, Reality Labs, and Superintelligence. The headcount metric included in Meta's before the recent superintelligence unit layoffs. Advertising demand has increased, Li says. Average price-per-ad was up 10% year-over-year. Reality Labs revenue was up thanks to retailers stocking up on Quest headsets before the holiday season, she says. While Meta paid a one-time $15.9 billion tax charge, Li adds that the company expects its taxes to go down due to Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Meta's Ray-Ban Connects sold out in "almost every store" within 48 hours, Zuckerberg says. Demo slots are fully booked up through the end of next month, he adds. Zuckerberg says that Meta will invest more in the area. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg says artificial intelligence is already boosting engagement — and profits — across the company's apps. In his opening remarks, he says AI-powered recommendation systems have led to 5% more time spent on Facebook, and 3-10% more time on Threads, with video viewing on Instagram up more than 30% over the past year. "Reels now has an annual run rate of over $50 billion," Zuckerberg added. He said Meta's "three giant transformers" — AI models powering Facebook, Instagram, and ads — are increasingly driving how people discover content and how advertisers reach them. "Retention is looking good" for Vibes, Meta's AI video feed, Zuckerberg says. Usage is growing week over week, and it is an example of a new type of content, he adds. Zuckerberg says that there have been two eras of social media: content from friends and family, and content from creators. The next "corpus" of content will be from AI, he says. That will make recommendation systems valuable. The ARR for Meta's AI-powered ad tools has hit $60 billion. Mark Zuckerberg starts by touting Meta's social app success and superintelligence team. Instagram hit 3 billion monthly active users, and Threads hit 150 million monthly actives. Mark Zuckerberg starts by touting Meta's social app success and superintelligence team. Instagram hit 3 billion monthly active users, and Threads hit 150 million monthly actives. The Meta CEO also says that they are building an "industry-leading" amount of compute. He adds that he wanted to "aggressively frontload" building capacity for superintelligence. In the worst case, he says, Meta can "slow" building infrastructure. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Suan Li are on the call. They'll begin by reading through their prepared remarks before fielding questions from analysts in a live Q&A. Meta said it expects to spend between $70 billion and $72 billion on infrastructure this year as it builds out the computing power behind its AI ambitions, slightly higher than the $66 billion to $72 billion range it projected last quarter. The company said its demand for computing capacity has "expanded meaningfully," prompting bigger investments in data centers and cloud services. Meta added that its infrastructure spending will keep rising next year, with capital expenditure growth in 2026 expected to be "notably larger" than in 2025. Meta paid a one-time tax charge of $15.93 billion this quarter. The company expected a "significant reduction" in federal cash tax payments thanks to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which passed in July. The act's implementation allowed for a "valuation allowance against our U.S. federal deferred tax assets," the company said, causing them to pay a one-time, non-cash income tax charge of $15.93 billion.

Otherwise, Meta says: Meta's Reality Labs revenue was $470 million with an operating loss of $4.432 billion for the quarter. The division houses Meta's AI consumer hardware, virtual reality gear, and metaverse spending, among other things. That includes Meta's Ray-Ban Displays, which the company announced in September. Reality Lab's losses are shrinking, albeit slightly, with the company losing $4.53 billion last quarter. Third Quarter Results Source: Bloomberg Forrester VP and Research Director Mike Proulx told Business Insider that Meta's third quarter was "flooded with feature updates, device announcements, and operational moves," with AI as the common thread. "Of particular note is the launch of Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which effectively launched a new computing platform," Proulx said. "During the earnings call, I'll be listening for an update on sales. I suspect these glasses will mostly attract early tech-curious adopters, and that demos will far outpace actual purchases." He added that Reels' prominence on Instagram continues to grow as the app edges closer to TikTok, and that advertisers are unlikely to pull back spending despite Meta losing brand-safety accreditation from the Media Rating Council, given the platform's reach and performance. Meta has quietly assembled one of the most expensive AI teams in Silicon Valley under its Meta Superintelligence Labs division, hiring top researchers from DeepMind and OpenAI and spending billions on infrastructure. Yet the elite unit responsible for building next-generation AI models — literally named TBD — remains a black box. Investors will be listening closely for any clues from Zuckerberg on what, exactly, it's building. In September, the company debuted its new Ray-Ban Displays at the Connect conference. The glasses come with a built-in screen that displays text messages, maps, and captions over the real world. The Displays went on sale in late September. Within days, CTO Andrew Bosworth posted on Threads that the glasses were sold out and demos were booked up through November at "almost every store."

The Displays went on sale in late September. Within days, CTO Andrew Bosworth posted on Threads that the glasses were sold out and demos were booked up through November at "almost every store." Expect further questions on the analyst call about the sales mix between the screen-free Meta Ray-Ban AI glasses and the more expensive Ray-Ban Displays. In September, Meta released its new short-form AI video feed, Vibes. Some tech founders and execs quickly roasted it as "AI slop." Days later, OpenAI released its new video generation model, Sora 2. Its own short-form Sora app quickly topped the App Store charts. OpenAI has said that 1 million people downloaded the Sora app within five days, while Similarweb data indicates that the Meta AI app's downloads surged by 100,000 after the Vibes feed launched. We might get some further data points on Vibes engagement among Meta's users on the earnings call. Meta has faced some dramatic changes to its headcount in the past few months. After doling out big contracts to staff up its superintelligence unit, Meta cut 600 jobs from it. Meta also cut staff in its risk division as the company automated its review process, per a memo viewed by Business Insider. These cuts come after January's broader layoffs, when Meta cut 5% of its workforce — roughly 3,600 employees — that the company labeled "low performers."

These cuts come after January's broader layoffs, when Meta cut 5% of its workforce — roughly 3,600 employees — that the company labeled "low performers." It'll be interesting to see if Zuckerberg or CFO Susan Li talks about plans for future head count growth — or if they anticipate head count to remain flat or decrease in the coming quarters. When Facebook rebranded to Meta in 2021, Zuckerberg declared a "very long-term bet" on the metaverse. The company then spent billions on projects like Horizon. The fervor has since quieted, though the company announced a new AI feature to build 3D worlds with text at its September Meta Connect event. On Monday, Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth told employees the company was reshuffling its metaverse unit in a memo viewed by Business Insider. "The priority of the metaverse work remains unchanged, and it continues to be a companywide priority," he wrote. Mark Zuckerberg said Meta could spend up to $72 billion this year on AI infrastructure. Will Zuck raise that number even higher? It's possible, but if all this AI capex spend is really hurting Meta's free cash flow and margins, investors might start feeling uneasy. That's why they'll be laser-focused on Meta's advertising business, which still makes up most of the company's earnings. If ad numbers are healthy — and right now, expectations from Wall Street are high — then Zuck probably has more runway for his AI bets. Tech analysts at DA Davidson wrote ahead of Meta's earnings that they're watching for how Meta does compared to its Magnificent Seven peer Alphabet, which also reports results on Wednesday. "We expect META to continue outgrowing Google's ad revenue, though growth may decelerate on tougher comps (including elections)," the firm said in a client note. "We do not expect growth at Google to decelerate significantly, though we are monitoring OpenAI closely, as we believe the likely introduction of advertising around ChatGPT may create a headwind for Google Search advertising growth."

CFRA rates the stock a "Buy" and has an $880 price target for the stock, representing potential upside of 16%. JPMorgan's Doug Annuth wrote that he's bullish on the social media company's AI push ahead of earnings. After a big round of layoffs in Meta's AI unit, there's a lot of anticipation for updates on the superintelligence strategy. "We're bullish on AI Ad improvements, Reels, & Video. META continues to execute well across its AI strategy & push toward personal superintelligence prioritizing ads, engagement, business messaging, Meta AI, & AI Devices."

The bank has a $900 price target on Meta stock, a 19% increase from current levels. THIRD QUARTER Source: Bloomberg Jump to

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The uber-rich are only getting richer as investors double down on the AI boom. The world's 10 wealthiest people have added a remarkable $523 billion to their fortunes this year, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows. Mastercard, Exxon Mobil, and Netflix are all worth less than that; their market values were between $460 billion and $520 billion at Monday's close. Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison has notched the biggest wealth gain so far this year with a $150 billion increase in net worth, to $343 billion. Alphabet cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are both up more than $60 billion since the start of 2025, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang have added more than $50 billion to their respective fortunes in that timeframe. PC pioneer Michael Dell, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk have all gained more than $30 billion this year. Rounding out the 10 biggest wealth winners are LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, up $19 billion and $11 billion, respectively, in just under 10 months. The top 10 names on Bloomberg's list added $45 billion to their combined fortunes on Monday alone as strong tech earnings and receding trade-war fears drove stocks to new highs. They're collectively worth almost $2.5 trillion, or more than Amazon — a company with over $600 billion in annual sales and more than 1.5 million employees. The 10 richest people have added over half a trillion dollars to their fortunes this year, almost entirely because of AI optimism, fueled by buzzy partnerships, massive contracts, and sky-high growth forecasts. Year to date, Oracle stock has soared nearly 70%, Alphabet, Nvidia, and Dell have surged by over 40%, and Meta and Microsoft have jumped by over 25%. All of the top 10 wealthiest people, except Arnault, are major shareholders of the world's biggest AI companies, so those share-price gains have lifted the value of their stakes and inflated their net worths. Market watchers are divided over whether the AI boom is a bubble about to burst or the start of a tech revolution. In recent interviews with Business Insider, investors Ross Gerber and Kevin O'Leary have hailed AI as a game-changing technology, while economist Gary Shilling, investor Bill Smead, professor Erik Gordon, and strategist Paul Dietrich have said it's fostering extreme speculation that could end in disaster.

Title: What Caused Constellation Energy Stock To Surge By 80%?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Constellation Energy (CEG) experienced a remarkable increase of 76%, driven not only by a slight rise in revenue but also by a significant spike in the P/E ratio and a squeeze in margins. Behind the scenes are pivotal developments: a transformative partnership with Meta, a strategic acquisition of Calpine, optimistic endorsements from analysts, and a rapidly increasing demand for both AI and nuclear energy—altering its prospects in real time. What is going on in this situation? The stock soared by 76%, propelled by a 5.3% rise in revenue, a 24% decline in margins, and an impressive 118% increase in the P/E ratio. Let’s delve into the factors that contributed to these changes. Prior to examining the specific events that prompted the surge in stock price, it’s worth noting what market insight reveals: Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management – a wealth management firm in the Boston area – whose asset allocation strategies delivered favorable returns during the 2008-09 downturn when the S&P plummeted by over 40%. Empirical integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio into its asset allocation strategy to offer clients enhanced returns with reduced risk in comparison to the benchmark index; presenting a much smoother ride, as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance statistics. Opinion: At present, we consider CEG stock to be unattractive. What’s the reason? Check out the comprehensive story. Read Buy or Sell CEG Stock to understand what informs our current perspective. Risk: An effective way to measure risk is by analyzing how much CEG declines in significant market crashes. During the Inflation Shock, it fell approximately 24%. Although that’s less severe than some other crises, it demonstrates that even strong stocks can suffer when the market experiences downturns. No stock is immune to abrupt shocks, regardless of its fundamentals. Consistently selecting winners is challenging – particularly due to the volatility associated with individual stocks. Alternatively, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which consists of 30 different stocks, has a proven record of significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four years. What accounts for this success? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with lower risk than the benchmark index; providing a more stable investment experience, as illustrated by HQ Portfolio performance data.

Title: Corporate America is offering clues about how it sees its workforce meshing with AI

Every time Dan publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Good morning. Although that's not the case for some Amazon employees. The tech giant just announced that it's cutting 14,000 corporate jobs, marking one of the biggest rounds of layoffs in the company's history. Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti, announced the cuts in a blog post and said the reductions are a continuation of CEO Andy Jassy's drive to operate the company "like the world's largest startup." Speaking of staffing reductions, artificial intelligence's impact on company headcounts remains a top concern for workers. Today we're looking at how a top Wall Street bank and a tech company gave us a preview of what to expect. What's on deck: Markets: A once red-hot corner of commercial real estate has cooled off considerably. Tech: Tesla's chair gave a stark warning about what's at stake if Elon Musk's pay package isn't approved. Business: The scariest part about Halloween might be the price of candy. But first, what does AI mean for ME? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Forget the billions getting invested. Forget fears over a bubble. Most people's biggest question about AI is simple: How will it impact my job? Executives at two very different companies recently offered clues on how corporate America is thinking about AI's impact on its workforce. First, you have Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, who told Axios that AI isn't taking away bankers' jobs. Instead, the tech just means the bank needs "more high-value people." Solomon acknowledged the widely held belief that AI will change how bankers do their job, but he reiterated his previous prediction that the bank will have more employees a decade from now, thanks to AI. Then you have Vercel, which helps developers build and deploy websites and applications. The company reduced a 10-person sales team down to one after a top-performing worker trained an AI agent to do most of the tasks, the firm's COO told BI's Lakshmi Varanasi. The other nine employees weren't fired, though. Instead, they're now focusing on more complex, higher-value sales work, the exec told Lakshmi. Despite one being a prestigious Wall Street bank and the other a relatively new tech company, both shared a common narrative regarding the AI-and-the-worker debate: The tech is here to elevate, not eliminate. Companies' willingness to stick to that mantra remains to be seen. For a while, businesses were in a holding pattern, or a "Great Freeze," BI's Madison Hoff wrote. Numerous uncertainties — tariffs, AI, and the broader economy — meant companies were neither hiring nor firing. But that trend seems to be thawing, as is evident from Amazon's recent news. And there's no guarantee everyone whose job was automated by AI will still have higher-value work to focus on. For every worker who AI enables to work on something more valuable, there will be those who can't find another way to contribute. (Though, perhaps that's more the employees' problem than AI.) There's also AI's business model to consider. As the companies touting these tools face more pressure from investors to generate revenue, the cost of using them may rise. That, in turn, will force companies to reconsider their budgets and headcounts. Even those working on the very AI expected to lead to so much disruption aren't immune. That was evident when Meta cut 600 workers from its Meta Superintelligence Labs. We'll get an even better sense this week about how those with front-row seats to the AI revolution are thinking about headcounts when Big Tech reports earnings. 1. One of the pandemic's real estate bets is now off. Lab space was a hot bet in real estate, especially during COVID, when it played a leading role in combating the disease. Thanks to a pullback in federal research funding and venture capital, compounded with high vacancy rates, the sector is now suffering. 2. Investors are stoked about a reprieve from trade tensions. A US-China trade truce sent stocks to all-time highs, extending the gains logged on Friday. From investors buying chip stocks and treasury yields jumping, here are the five big moves in the market. 3. The Beyond Meat meme investor has a new target. Dimitri Semenikhin is eyeing ETHZilla Corporation, a biotech firm that pivoted to crypto. He told BI that his case for the stock is similar to the reason he thinks Beyond Meat is undervalued. He's also bullish on crypto in general, despite its volatility. 1. Meta's metaverse unit is getting a reshuffling. Gabriel Aul and Ryan Cairns will now lead the company's metaverse efforts, per an internal memo sent by Meta's CTO, which was seen by BI. In a different memo — also seen by BI — Vishal Shah, who has helped lead its metaverse bets over the last four years, announced that he's moving to Meta Superintelligence Labs. 2. Tesla shareholders get an ultimatum. Tesla chair Robyn Denholm sent out a warning to shareholders regarding Elon Musk's coming $1 trillion pay package: Either approve the package or risk losing Musk as Tesla's CEO. The package has seen pushback from proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis. One thing he doesn't have to worry about: where he stands with the president these days. 3. Fake it till you make it. Tech hopefuls are putting San Francisco in their social media bios even if they don't live there. They do it to attract investors, for the clout, and to signal their commitment to the industry. 1. Everybody scream! (At the price of those Twix bars.) Prices of candy and gum have skyrocketed, increasing at a rate much faster than inflation. Tariffs are a contributor, whether on cane sugar, cocoa, or elsewhere. But hey, at least your dentist is probably happy. 2. Why Taylor Sheridan's Paramount departure matters. The guy behind "Yellowstone" is heading to Comcast's NBCUniversal. It's a big loss for Paramount owner David Ellison, who previously signaled that keeping Sheridan is a priority, BI's Peter Kafka writes. Meanwhile, Paramount Skydance is set to lay off over 1,000 employees on Wednesday, a person familiar with the plans confirmed to BI. 3. Lessons about happiness after five years of mood-tracking. BI's Julia Pugachevsky tracked her moods every day for almost five years. She learned a lot about happiness, including one habit that greatly improved her mood than anything else.

All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ This is Masters in business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio This week on the podcast. Strap yourself in for another great one. Liz Ann Sonders, chief Investment strategist at Schwab, helping to manage $11 trillion in client assets. What a fascinating career she’s had. She’s been on all of the best of lists. She’s just really insightful. What she does is really kind of unique. She combines top down market analysis with looking at everything from sentiment to economic data to fund flows, to really what the clients of Schwab are, are doing. I know Liz for almost 25 years. Every time I speak with her, it’s always great. This is another conversation that is all also fabulous. With no further ado my discussion with Liz Ann Saunders, Liz Ann Sonders: Always great to see you… Barry Ritholtz: I know it’s always, I always have so much, I’ve 00:01:11 [Speaker Changed] Known each other for a long time, Liz Ann Sonders: A long time. It’s always so much fun chatting with you. I wanna talk about what you’re doing with the podcast and what you’re doing at Schwab, but I have to start with a little bit of your background. Undergraduate economics and poli sci at Delaware, MBA in finance from Fordham, Barry Ritholtz: At the time you went there, was it called Gabelli? Liz Ann Sonders: No, it was not. Barry Ritholtz: It’s now called the Gabelli School of School Business. Was the career plan always Wall Street? Liz Ann Sonders: No, I honestly, I, I think if you brought me back to my college days and asked, what is your career plan? If I was honest, I probably would’ve said not quite sure yet. I, the, the decision to do a double major there was, to keep it very open and broad. All I knew was that I wanted to live and work in New York City. So got out of undergrad, pounded the pavement in New York, but, but across the spectrum of industries, not all Wall Street, I, I interviewed at a sports marketing firm and an ad agency, and I had two interviews in a row at Zweig. Avatar did a lot of research on the company, which by the way, this was in 1986. So doing research on a company meant going to the library, pulling up a microfiche machine, actually cranking the handle I recall, and look at newspaper clippings and was fascinated by Marty Sweig, the, the co-founder and enjoyed the interview process, liked the people with whom I met, and I don’t know, a little voice just said this, this seems to make sense. And Barry Ritholtz: I recall reading a book, Marty’s Zweig wrote, I wanna say in the late nineties, when I was on a trading desk, Winning on Wall Street, Liz Ann Sonders: Late eighties, Barry Ritholtz: Well, I got his book when I started around the time of the Netscape, IPO. Liz Ann Sonders: That’s when I, he, he did, you know, newer versions. He did updated versions, but I think so… Barry Ritholtz: Whatever that version was in ninety six, ninety seven. And I vividly recall that. How did you, how did you get the gig with Marty’s wag? What was that like? Liz Ann Sonders: It, I was a grunt at the outset. I did whatever they needed me to do, but they were a firm that believed in promoting from within and educating their young people. So I saw that as an opportunity. They, they paid for grad school a hundred percent. So I made the easy financial decision to do that at night while still learning a living and having my education paid for. And so many things that I learned from Marty, I could consider him the, the first mentor, whether he realized it or, or not. Barry Ritholtz: People, by the way, people don’t realize, especially the generation that came of age in 2000, what a legend he was. Liz Ann Sonders: Unbelievable legend. Barry Ritholtz: I think at one point in time he owned the, the most expensive apartment in the United States. Is is that true? Liz Ann Sonders: Yes. It was the top three floors of the Pierre, which is now owned by the Commerce Secretary. Barry Ritholtz: That’s amazing. And he was always the answer to, “Hey, do any of these technicians make any money?” And the answer was, yeah, look at Marty Zweig. I mean, for, for the younger folks, go look up Marty Zweig. He was absolutely a legend. I remember him from my early days, because he was on Rukeyser. Liz Ann Sonders: He was one of the originals on, on the original Wall Street Week. Barry Ritholtz: Yep. I mean, back in the day when all of financial media was an hour, that was television a week. Not even Liz Ann Sonders: Was a half hour. That’s 8:30 PM Friday nights. That’s right. On PBS produced by Maryland Public Television. That’s right. And Marty was not only one of the original panelists, he was, I think, the original elf as, as Lou used to describe them, Barry Ritholtz: The people who came back on a regular basis? Liz Ann Sonders: And that’s another thing that intrigued me about joining the firm, is I remember getting a little bit of a, kind of a wink, wink, nod nod from a, an economics professor that I had, not just to me, but to the class. And he made a funny comment about, given that one of the, the jobs that we had as students was to read the Wall Street Journal every day and just keep up on markets and the economy, and that if you had too many late nights at the Stone Balloon, you might wanna just get a really brilliant 30 minute recap by watching Wall Street Week on Friday night before you then go out. So I thought, all right, I’ll see what this Wall Street Week is all about. And so I started watching it before I joined the business, before I started at, at Swg Avatar. And, and then I joined the show in 1997, which was surreal. Barry Ritholtz: So you were not that far outta school when you started? 00:06:03 [Speaker Changed] Well, I was, yeah, I was 11 years. So since you and I have talked about our first experience together, which was on TV years, first, it was my first TVeExperience, first TV appearance on Kudlow. Liz Ann Sonders: And I, I, I went on the show as a special guest. So I remember getting the, the little, you know, pink slip from the receptionist that told you who had called. There was voicemail at that time that said Rich de Roth, the producer of Wall Street Week called They’d like You to come on as a guest. And I thought it was somebody playing a prank on me. Barry Ritholtz: Really? Liz Ann Sonders: Yeah, until I called and it was legit. And I went on as a, a guest. And then in shortly after that, they asked me to become a regular panelist, and it was a thrill. Barry Ritholtz: So you were Zweig for a number of years, [13] you end up go 13 years. Wow. That’s a long time. Liz Ann Sonders: 86 to 99. Barry Ritholtz: How did you end up at US Trust? Liz Ann Sonders: So that was kind of funny. I was on the avatar side of this [Zweig Avatar] broad set of companies, which was the institutional money management side. I was a portfolio manager, co-ran stock selection. But I was always much more intrigued by interested in and with a desire to spend more of my time doing top down macro research Barry Ritholtz: As opposed to bottom up Liz Ann Sonders: The inner voice said, you don’t really love this that much. And there wasn’t really an opportunity for that. I, I, it wasn’t that I was pigeonholed, but, but it was a growing role as a portfolio manager. So I got recruited over to US Trust to co-run their large cap growth area, which, which put me yet again in that position, but felt like the platform was broader. And my inclusion on the investment policy committee, they actually purposely wanted some top down analysis based on my learnings for working Barry Ritholtz: Liz For the ultimate large cap growth means here’s the universe, it’s, it’s a hundred of the S&P 500. Liz Ann Sonders: , and we were a concentrated manager [only owning 30 positions only?] No less than 25 typically, with a four to five year holding period. Barry Ritholtz: So not a closet indexer, a high active share. Liz Ann Sonders: But I also didn’t love the pigeonholing aspect of it. Mm. Where, you know, the mantra had to be large cap growth. I, I, I liked thinking bigger picture and thinking about different parts of the market cycle and what works. So 10 months after I joined US, trust, Schwab acquired us Trust. Barry Ritholtz: That was 2000. And you’ve been with Schwab for a quarter century? Liz Ann Sonders: Since then for, it’ll be 26 years. Wow. At the beginning of next year. And the, the re when I realized I did indeed wanna be adopted by the new parent company was when Chuck Schwab himself came to New York with our CEO at the time, Dave Patrick, and sat with me and said, we would like to create this role of chief investment strategist, which didn’t exist at Schwab before. This was the beginning of our entree into actually giving advice as opposed to just being a platform for, for traders. Barry Ritholtz: So, so let, let’s dive into that. So I was gonna ask you what the process was like, but they acquired us trust for the assets and for the platform. You were a bonus that came along with it, right? Liz Ann Sonders: Well, well, that’s kind of you to say. Well, I mean, they, they did offer me the, the role. It had not existed before. Barry Ritholtz: That’s a big deal. Liz Ann Sonders: And I said, yes, please. Barry Ritholtz: Yeah, absolutely. Liz Ann Sonders: And the rest is 26 years of history. Barry Ritholtz: So let, let’s dive into this. What are the, let, let’s take a look at the numbers on the Schwab platform as a custodian or however Schwab is touching a 401k. How many trillions of dollars are on that platform? Liz Ann Sonders: 11.23 trillion… Barry Ritholtz: All right. So keep working at it. You’ll, get somewhere soon… Liz Ann Sonders: Yeah. That’s trillion with s about a third of the size of the US economy. Wow. Barry Ritholtz: That’s unbelievable. And at the time, what was Schwab? Schwab in 2000? Liz Ann Sonders: Oh gosh. One, something like that. It was less than that. Because I remember getting this little… Barry Ritholtz: Plexiglass plaque? Liz Ann Sonders: Well, no, it was a, it was a holder for sticky notes and it had a star on it, and it said, you know, 1 trillion in client assets. But that was after the, so that’s acquisition of me. Barry Ritholtz: So that’s an incredible growth. Schwab really is a platform that are so many things to so many different people. There’s an institutional business, there’s a business. And full disclosure, we custody right at our firm at Schwab, most of our assets are there. So you custody for RIAs and others, self-directed investors, individuals who doesn’t Schwab work with? It’s pretty much everybody in the industry. Liz Ann Sonders: Well, traditional institutions. So the way we define institutional, when we talk about it and use that term somewhat generically, we’re actually referring to the part of the business that you’re involved with. So independent wealth management firms, RIAs, that, that platform with Schwab via the custody of assets, but a heck of a lot more than just that. So that’s how we defined institutional it of the, and I’m totally using rounded numbers here, but of the 10, of the 11 and a quarter trillion is about evenly divided between individual investors on our platform. Self-directed. Self-directed. And well, not always. Now we have, we have a whole wealth management arm that’s all, that all feeds, not just to the individual investor side of what we do, but to in your world advisor. So advisors on our platform. So that’s about evenly split. And then, then the remainder is workplace services. So stock plans for big companies and managing, managing 4 0 1 Ks. So it’s what we, but we we’re dominated by individual investors, even on the quote institutional side, because most of the advisors on our platform manage money for individuals. Barry Ritholtz: Hmm. That’s really interesing. Liz Ann Sonders: So we would consider the advisor our client, but we’re, we’re providing a platform there for them, you guys, to advise for the most part, individual investors. Barry Ritholtz: And, and I know I’ve told you this story before, but when we launched RWM in 2013, we launched with TD — years later acquired by Schwab. Hold that aside. And we are, were very data driven. We ran a lot of analytics. And every time we didn’t win a prospect when we would go through the list of the reasons, the number one reason is, “Hey, you guys don’t custody with Schwab and my money’s at Schwab and call us if you ever decide to.” Absolutely true. And finally, we all looked at each other, Hey, there’s no reason not to open a second custodian. And so we did. And it caused a flood of new clients and new families joining us because well, well done. But, but the crazy thing is, it’s like I have never seen a financial institution with that much brand loyalty from the audience. From the clients. Because think about it, when you talk to people about Wells Fargo or Citibank or any large financial traditional bank, maybe a little bit at JP Morgan Chase, but for the most part, no one says, oh, “I don’t want to be with you. You are not affiliated with, I’m making up stuff. KeyBank.” But we just heard it so many times. It’s like, all right, you only have to hit me in the head so many times before I realized there’s a, there’s an issue here. Liz Ann Sonders: The, the power of our reputation is really extraordinary. And, Schwab dates back, you know, about 53 years. Wow. 54 years. That’s, that’s amazing. Yeah. Seventies. And, you know, Chuck has, has written about the history of Schwab and his history. His most recent book was called Invested. And it was essentially a, a memoir of, of his time in this business. And Barry Ritholtz: When you say Chuck, Liz Ann Sonders: Chuck Schwab himself, Barry Ritholtz: Chuck Schwab, who people used to think wasn’t a real guy. Liz Ann Sonders: No, it’s a real guy. The guy in the commercials is him. Barry Ritholtz: And he’s still up and about You were telling me he was, he’s just won a golf tournament at 88. Liz Ann Sonders: Yeah. Last year he won the Nantucket Golf Club. That’s unbelievable. Member, member at 87. And he almost won it again this year at at 88. So regularly shoots below his age, still a very active chair of the board. And but the, the, the culture that he has imbued in in Schwab is really second to none. And, you know, our, our sort of corporate for, for lack of a better word, tagline is through client size. And he has fostered this live, eat and breathe. Everything you do has to be from the perspective of of clients. Barry Ritholtz: So you are really the perfect person to ask a question. And I’ll ask it specifically about Schwab, but it’s obviously true about the entire industry. You’ve witnessed a shift from a lot of self-directed investors over to the advisor driven side. What has that process been like at Schwab? Liz Ann Sonders: So it’s not talking about trillions of dollars, right? Not just the advisor side, but investors at Schwab who, who want guidance, who want advice, whether it’s through advisors on our platform or directly with us on our private client side of the, the business. And it’s just the natural evolution of Schwab moving decades ago from a platform for the self-directed to a behemoth that actually provides that guidance and advice now, both directly through certain channels and indirectly through the advisor channel. Barry Ritholtz: So true or false? And, and I love this question ’cause so many people doubt it. We are today in a golden age for investing for individuals. How do you, how do you answer that? Liz Ann Sonders: Can I say yes? Yeah, Barry Ritholtz: True. Liz Ann Sonders: Just yes. No, I didn’t say true. I said yes, yes. Barry Ritholtz: its a Golden age of investing for me. Liz Ann Sonders: Well, I think it’s both true and false depending on how you define, Barry Ritholtz: Okay. Explain Golden age of investing Barry Ritholtz: Liz Ann Sonders:. I think we are, as it relates to individual investors that understand that discipline is such an important part of the process that they don’t think of getting get out as investing strategies. I, I fully agree that those are really gambling on moments in time. You wrote about it brilliantly in Well, thank you. In your book, the emotional side. Right. And so I think it’s true in the sense that a lot of those more seasoned investors that take that disciplined approach are, are more equipped now and have more access to information and guidance and when used in the right way has been to the great benefit of their success. But then you have retail traders, which I’m not here to say that they’re, you know, the ultimate contrarian indicator, but I think the perspective there is one of very short time horizons. The, you know, by the dip mentality, which, you know, to their credit, Barry Ritholtz: That works in a bull market. It works in painful bull market, very painful in a bear market. Liz Ann Sonders: But a lot of the, you know, younger retail trader that was born out of the pandemic era, it’s not that they have blinders on to the long term or the big picture, but they’ve been, they’ve been, I guess so far, anyway, to your point, properly schooled by virtue of, by the tip has worked. But I’m, I’m starting to get some anecdotal evidence that there, I, I’m not sure that there is a full understanding of what a market cycle actually looks like and that there is downside. So I, I think there, there’s more bifurcation and there’s a wider spread in terms of, of how investors are approaching the market or how traders are approaching the market. And they, they, they’re not in conflict, but they’re kind of at different ends of the spectrum from a what works, what doesn’t work, what are the benefits of taking a long-term approach, having those disciplines as opposed to just, you know, FOMO I’m in and, you know, buy every dip. Barry Ritholtz: Think about everybody who was born in the 1990s. By the time they come out of college post-financial crisis, they’ve pretty much only known right? One of the greatest rampaging bull markets in history. Liz Ann Sonders: And, and COVID was, was brutal from an economic three months and market perspective, right? But for, it was five weeks in the case of the market, right? Barry Ritholtz: Mid February To March, Liz Ann Sonders: and it was two months in the case of the recession. Right. So Barry Ritholtz: Although people still didn’t believe it throughout that summer, as, as from the March, 2020 lows till the end of the year, I think the S&P 500 was up 69%. And people fought it the whole way because their personal experience didn’t jive with what they were seeing. Liz Ann Sonders: Right, exactly. Exactly. Barry Ritholtz: In inequities, which, which is fascinating. So Schwab created the market strategist role for you, what does it mean being a market strategist? How does that differ from either a PM on the equity side or an economist more broadly? Liz Ann Sonders: Well, it, it’s certainly differentiated from a PM in that I am not, I’m not picking stocks. I’m not a trader. I don’t analyze individual stocks. So it’s, it’s purely top down 00:20:49 [Speaker Changed] In top down meaning markets economy. Yes. Do you look at sectors? Do you look at fixed income? What 00:20:56 [Speaker Changed] Comes into that? So we have my, my colleague and co-host on our on investment podcast is Kathy Jones. So she’s my counterpart on the fixed income side. She’s our chief fixed income strategist. And I, I say often it sounds like it’s jokingly, but it’s actually quite serious that I was thrilled when we brought Kathy on. ’cause then I was able to stop pretending like I was a deep dive expert in the fixed income side of things. My, my background is on the equity side of things, but what’s unique, I think about this role as it is, as it has existed in the almost 26 years that, that I’ve been at Schwab and have been in this role, is it, it blends the market analysis with the economic analysis. So we don’t have these distinct roles of chief economists and chief investment strategist. And that was always pleasing to me because I, I’m, I, I’m not sure I would either be as effective or enjoy what I do as much if I had to have my market views beholden to economic views that were completely distinct. 00:22:03 I think having that, that overlap and analysis has been a benefit. I also, because our investor base are almost all individual investors, that’s a very different audience that if you’re one of the big investment banking research wirehouse firms, a good chunk of your client base that is, that is a consumer of strategist work being institutions, I think it’s a very different animal in terms of what is valuable, what makes sense. And maybe importantly, again, in keeping with your book, you know, thinking about not just what matters, but what doesn’t matter, what shouldn’t matter. And I, I remember one of the first things that, that Chuck talked to me about 25 years ago was him not being a believer in the whole year end price target, which was music to my ears. Because I think particularly for individual investors, there’s really not that much practical value to that. It’s sort of one point in time every strategist has to adjust those forecasts constantly. It doesn’t tell you about how to manage through market cycles. It’s just one end point to one end point. And so that is certainly one of the differentiators as well, in addition to having that blended market analysis and economic analysis role, not sort of falling into the trap of the way strategists get pitted against one another. 00:23:31 [Speaker Changed] I love that you call it a trap because it’s easy to see what happens when people make a forecast like that and then they tend to marry it regardless of what data comes along. I think it was Ned Davis’ book was called Being Right or Making Money, and he explained how frequently people would just get so hung up on admitting error, right? That they would stay that’s right in the wrong position, the wrong posture, the wrong holdings, rather than admit they were wrong and adjust to whatever 00:24:06 [Speaker Changed] The data is. Yeah. And the trend, you know, one of Marty Zweig was well known for quite a, quite a bit, but you know, he coined the term Don’t Fight the Fed, but he also was known for saying the trend is your friend. And so staying in gear requires constant thinking and rethinking. In fact, I always use as an example of the perils of the year-end price target. If a strategist at the beginning of 1987 basically said the market’s gonna close pretty flat relative to where it ended 1986 by the end of the year, they were right from a point to point, however, to suggest that the market was just boring and flat all year. 00:24:48 [Speaker Changed] So there was that little hiccup in October, 00:24:50 [Speaker Changed] It was just a tiny littles hiccup. 00:24:51 [Speaker Changed] When, 00:24:52 [Speaker Changed] When was the 87 crash? That was Eptember 19th? Yeah, it was September. No, October 19th. October 19th. But there were, you know, there were warning signs and here can I tell you another funny Sure. Early story. So I started in the summer of 86 and as, and we were Marty’s side of the business, which was mutual funds, which was the Wena hedge fund, which is still ongoing onto the leadership of Joe Mena. We would be generically thought of as market timers. We were tactical asset allocators on the avatar institutional side, much more traditional market timing on the Zweig side, particularly the hedge fund. And coming into 87, we were over the cross of strategies, cross strategies were essentially fully invested, but started to get much more pessimistic about the market. In August, 00:25:43 [Speaker Changed] You had a huge run up, huge 00:25:45 [Speaker Changed] Run 00:25:45 [Speaker Changed] Up up until October, August, what was it like 30, 40%? Some crazy, 00:25:49 [Speaker Changed] I think it was more than 40 really? And so we started to adjust allocations down more extreme on the hedge fund side where Marty went, I, I think to anally a net short position 00:26:02 [Speaker Changed] And famously disgusted on Ru Kaiser 00:26:05 [Speaker Changed] The Friday night right before the crash he was on, you can YouTube it now. Yep, yep. And Lou asked him, or or made a comment, he said, Marty, you seem particularly bearish. And, and Marty was seen as this perma bear. Oh really? He was just, but he wasn’t, 00:26:24 [Speaker Changed] I know I don think of him in 00:26:25 [Speaker Changed] That way. He was just, he always was a nervous, he always had a little bit of that, that angst and that humble risk 00:26:30 [Speaker Changed] Aware. 00:26:31 [Speaker Changed] So he would at times be nervous when his view on the market was very bullish. But, so then Lou concluded the question with, do you think we have a bear market ahead of us? And Marty said, well, no, I think it’s more likely to be a crash. And I, 00:26:50 [Speaker Changed] That was Friday night, pretty 00:26:51 [Speaker Changed] Much it could happen any day. And then Monday, and then he not only said that, but then he laid out and I think it could be really ugly. But then I think we, we immediately rally off the low, but then we probably retest the low before we take off again. So here I am, less than a year in the business, we had gone from being almost fully invested in equities down to, I don’t know, 20 or 25% invested in equities. Right. Right before the crash. So the little voice in my head is thinking, what’s the big deal? Why is everybody freaking out? You just figure out before the crash that there’s going to be a crash. You move money out, right? And then you take it back in advantage of cheaper price. You put it back in easy, easy 00:27:34 [Speaker Changed] Peasy pie. Right? Right. 00:27:36 [Speaker Changed] Little did I know. 00:27:37 [Speaker Changed] And, and to just reflect how accurate zoi was, Monday down 22%, a rally that failed the next day. You didn’t quite get back down to the same 00:27:48 [Speaker Changed] Lows. You didn’t fully retest, but, but it 00:27:50 [Speaker Changed] Was pretty ugly again. But you came, you know, 22% in a day is kind excessive. 23%. 20, 22 8. If I, if 00:27:57 [Speaker Changed] All right, I’m rounding. Okay. Yes. 00:27:59 [Speaker Changed] And, and double check those numbers. I could be wrong, but, you know, portfolio insurance was a big part of that. Probably made what was a 10% correction more than double. So maybe that’s why you didn’t retest. And then it was off to the races, the race back to break even 00:28:15 [Speaker Changed] For the year. Right. And, and we had started buying after the, after the crash. So ended the year with just off the charts performance. And again, you know, naive young me is thinking, I don’t know why everybody’s freaking out, out so much. Why 00:28:28 [Speaker Changed] Are these people talking about how difficult this, it’s hard. So the obvious question, how significant was Marty to shaping your framework for understanding markets? 00:28:39 [Speaker Changed] Oh, extraordinarily impactful. Because I, I think the thing that resonated with me the most, and you wrote about it in your book, and it’s the likes of the Sir John Templeton quote about bull markets are born in pessimism, the grown skepticism, mature and optimism die on euphoria. I think that’s such a brilliant way to describe a market cycle, in part because the only terms used in there have to do with emotions. Exactly. There’s nothing in that line about market cycles that has anything to do with what we all obsess about on a day-to-day basis. Monetary policy, fiscal policy, what the next inflation report is going to be, even earnings and, and valuation. And Marty understood that too. And so much of the work that he did was steeped in that sentiment analysis. I, 00:29:20 [Speaker Changed] I love that you brought that up because I, I, so I took the technical analysis training course with Ralph Por, and I don’t really think of myself as a technician, but I certainly wouldn’t buy anything without looking at a chart. Right. It has to be a component, right? I don’t, I don’t need to see an analyst research report, but I have to at least get a sense of is it trend up? Is the trend down? Has this been going sideways for years? And the best technicians I know have always brought in behavioral economics Yes. And sentiment before we called it behavioral finances. Absolutely. And Marty certainly was one of those 00:29:56 [Speaker Changed] People. Absolutely. And so my my maybe sort of added focus on the emotional side, the sentiment side of the market very much was born out of my time working for, for Marty. And I, I still think it’s extraordinarily important. And, and one of the, the messages we always impart to our investors is ideally you don’t figure out the hard way whether there’s a wider or narrow gap between your financial risk tolerance and your emotional risk tolerance. Right? ’cause those two at times can be completely different. And I always describe financial risk tolerance as kind of what’s on the proverbial paper, right? What 00:30:36 [Speaker Changed] Can you, 00:30:36 [Speaker Changed] Your time horizon in, would you need income? What is this money for? Is it for retirement diversification, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But if you are going to, you know, panic and sell everything at the first bear market level declines in your portfolio, you’re maybe not as risk tolerant investors as you, you thought. And it’s, it’s just the vast majority of mistakes that we see. Extreme mistakes purely driven by emotion. 00:31:04 [Speaker Changed] It, you know, there’s a line I remember from when I was on a trading desk that I didn’t really understand then, but it sums up what you, that gap between your financial risk tolerance and your emotional risk tolerance, which is figure out who you are because Wall Street is an expensive place to learn. Exactly right. You don’t know who you are. You don’t know what your emotional pain allowance is. You don’t wanna panic out the word capitulation technically means surrender. So you go to a, a March oh nine, that capitulation meant people just couldn’t take the paint anymore. Make it stop. Just get me out of everything. And that’s how bottoms 00:31:44 [Speaker Changed] Are found. Can I share the March oh nine? Oh 00:31:46 [Speaker Changed] We were talking about? Yes. I, we were talking about 00:31:48 [Speaker Changed] I would love to hear that, but it, we didn’t have microphones in front of us. That’s right. So it was, let’s go back to March 6th, 2009. So I lived in Darien, Connecticut for 22 years. We raised our kids in Darien, and it’s one of the, the hotbeds of Wall Street, in fact, bedroom 00:32:08 [Speaker Changed] Community, short commute to the 00:32:09 [Speaker Changed] City, short commute to the city. Our town made the cover of business week in 2008, the latter part of 2008, as the town most impacted by the financial crisis in the country. And they did it based on the percentage of the working population that worked either on Wall Street in some capacity or in real estate. And so it was, I was surrounded by Wall Street people, not a lot of Wall Street women. It was also a town where most of the, the women who were raising kids were, were stay at home. So I was always steeped in conversation about the markets. And in the role that I had, I would always get peppered with questions. So my husband and I are at a dinner party in Dairy End. It was toward the end dinner and dessert had served maybe about a quarter of the people had left a smaller crowd just sitting around chatting. And the host of the party who was at that time, a 30 plus year veteran of Wall Street, said, Lizanne, I must say I I don’t envy you right now. And he was a bit dramatic, and he kind of paused for effect. And I said, oh, what do you mean? And he said, well, I really think that there’s no chance that the stock market ever gets to another high. I think there’s a decent chance that retail investors will never buy again. Wait, never, never, 00:33:30 [Speaker Changed] Never. Just done. 00:33:31 [Speaker Changed] Which makes me question the, the viability of a company like Schwab. And so I don’t even remember what I said. I I think I did some generic version. Well, I beg to differ, but I, I didn’t, I was also ready to leave. You know, I I, I I, I like a nine handle on my bedtime. So if it’s 1130, I’m like, okay, chop, chop. So I, I just, I, I wanted to end the night. We get in the car unprompted, I, and I haven’t had to embellish a story at all before. My husband puts a key in the car. He looked to me, he said, did you hear it? And I said, the bell ringing. Yep. He said, I knew you were thinking that. So I called my friend the next morning and I said, I am working on a report. And all of my research reports, written research reports, I use rock song titles, right. I’m a rock chick from way back. So I said, I am working on a report that I want a title. Here comes the sun. Can I share the anecdote? No 00:34:27 [Speaker Changed] Name, just the no 00:34:28 [Speaker Changed] Anecdote. I said, I’m not gonna mention name. He said, sure, I think you’re gonna regret it. Every time I see him, he does like the fist to the forehead. Like, oh my gosh. And that was when the last person is standing has gone down. Right. That is, and I think that’s inter what’s interesting about sene is we know sentiment at extremes serves as a contrarian indicator. 00:34:51 [Speaker Changed] Right. Most of the time you could pretty much ignore that middle 00:34:54 [Speaker Changed] Range without, without anything resembling precise timing. That said, as we all learned in the late 1990s, extremely optimistic sentiment can last for a really long time. Right. You know, Greenspan made as a rational exuberance comment in 96, 00:35:08 [Speaker Changed] December 96. 00:35:08 [Speaker Changed] That’s right. And it wasn’t until, you know, three plus years later that the market topped out 00:35:12 [Speaker Changed] March, 2000, almost four years. 00:35:14 [Speaker Changed] That said, when sentiment gets to such an extreme of despair, it’s not a precise contrarian timing, but there’s a narrower window. Pay 00:35:24 [Speaker Changed] Attention. 00:35:24 [Speaker Changed] Yes. Pay more attention to extremes of despair than you do extremes of enthusiasm, because the ladder can last a long 00:35:32 [Speaker Changed] Time. Tops are a process. Yes. Bottoms are a moment. Bottoms are a moment. Exactly. Absolutely. And you know, there are all these old trader cliches and stuff, but they become cliches for a reason. A reason. Absolutely. And, you know, we all experience the world in a very narrow window of 8 billion people on the planet. Our experiences are maybe 10th of a percent of what the rest of the world is experiencing. And so we tend to extrapolate out to the rest of the world. But very often what’s happening in the markets is not a reflecting your personal experience, but after you’ve lived through enough cycles, you start to be able to hear those sort of things. I had a, that was a pure death of equities business we call cover from the late seventies and a year or two later. That was it. It was the next thousand percent route 00:36:28 [Speaker Changed] Market. Yeah, 00:36:29 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. Amazing story. I 00:36:30 [Speaker Changed] Have one other anecdote that’s an interesting one to think about how emotions come into play was out in Silicon Valley area maybe about a year ago, a little less than a year ago, and heard from a client that he had finally given in to his financial consultant suggestion that he trimmed just back about 10% of his NVIDIA holdings. He was an ex-employee, had a lot just, you know, diversification, 00:36:55 [Speaker Changed] Right? We’re gonna leave some money on the table in order to reduce your drawdowns and 00:36:59 [Speaker Changed] Volatility. And he ended up splitting the difference. He didn’t wanna trim any, he trimmed 5% and then the stock went up by 20 some odd percent in the short term. And he, he was mad at the financial consultant that the stock had gone up. And to his, our financial consultant’s credit said, would you really be happier if the 95% you still own went down 20%? 00:37:22 [Speaker Changed] Listen, in the beginning of this year in video lost, but that’s psychology of its value 00:37:26 [Speaker Changed] That they, he was almost more, and he, to his credit, he said, you know what, that’s the way I should think about it. Was more concerned about the top tick, the bottom tick. Right. I trimmed it. Wasn’t I brilliant because then the stock went down 20%. So it it, our emotions play tricks on us in a lot of different directions. 00:37:43 [Speaker Changed] You, you brought up my book, I try not to talk about it on the show. It was a great book. But the regret minimization chapter Yes. Is all about your role as an individual investor is not to outperform the market, right? Or top tick or bottom tick stocks. It’s, Hey, how can you avoid making decisions that you’re gonna say 10 years later? What an idiot. I was. Right. Just, just as Charlie Munger said, what can you do to be less stupid? Right? And if, you know, we see these portfolios that started out as a million or $2 million, but through either smarts or good Luck or some combination. They had a big slug of Nvidia 10 years ago, and now they have a $20 million portfolio, 18 million of which is Nvidia. Hey, do you really wanna ride this up and down? Yeah. You’ve won 20. Yeah, exactly. Think about what $20 million in long-term investing does for you. Do you really wanna ride this down when it takes one of its regular drawdowns? And what I wanna say, it gave up about a trillion dollars in market cap this year before recovering. But 00:38:50 [Speaker Changed] Can I, can I say something else? Not, and I’m not an analyst, I don’t cover Nvidia, but the whole focus, the Uber focus on the magnificent seven, let’s just use that as an example of a cohort. So the, we’re dealing with cap weighted indexes in the case of the s and p and the, and the nasdaq. And I think one of the messages we impart to individual investors is, don’t feel like you have to have the same concentration as what’s embedded in these cap weighted indexes. That’s an institutional problem. If you’re benchmarked against the s and p on a quarterly basis, right. You are at the mercy of the construction of that index. But as a, an example of how I I describe this, Nvidia is the best performing stock within the Mag seven year to date, but it’s the 47th best performing stock in the s and p 500. Wow. It’s the number one contributor to s and p gains by cap by virtue of the multiplier of the cap size. So there’s 46 stocks in the s and p that have out, that are outperforming Nvidia this year. NVIDIA’s, I think rank number 630 something in the nasdaq. Meaning there’s 630 some odd stocks within the NASDAQ that are outperforming the best performing mag seven. So it’s the concentrate, it’s the contribution that sometimes gets conflated with the performance. 00:40:07 [Speaker Changed] I have a buddy who’s a technician who looks at a ratio of the market cap s and p versus the equal weight s and p. And what we’ve been seeing this year is the equal weight, I’m trying to remember where we are now. I haven’t looked at it recently, but when it’s going up, it’s telling you the big caps are faltering. And when the ratio is going down, it’s telling you the big caps are doing well, unless I’m, I’m doing that backwards. It depends on which one is the numerator, which one is the denominator. But clearly the outsized weight market cap wise is, is Nvidia number one or two behind Microsoft or Apple? 00:40:43 [Speaker Changed] It’s number one right now. But it’s been, you know, meta and alphabet have actually been kind of battling. But, and then also Microsoft, those are the four of the mag seven that are outperforming the s and p year to date. The other three are underperforming. And in fact, a few days ago, ’cause I tracked this on a daily basis, apple was down, I think 7% year to date that was, is its worst year to date performance. And it was the 503rd ranked contributor to the s and p. So the multiplier of cap size works in the other direction if, if you’re an underperformer as well. And a lot of people say, well, what do you mean 503? The s and p has 500 stocks, 00:41:19 [Speaker Changed] A and B shares, 00:41:20 [Speaker Changed] Google, 00:41:21 [Speaker Changed] Berk, Berkshire, you have a few big 00:41:23 [Speaker Changed] Companies like that. So 00:41:24 [Speaker Changed] That’s a great trivia question, how many company, how many stocks are 00:41:27 [Speaker Changed] In? How many stocks are in the s and p 500? And there’s also not 2000 in the Russell 2000 00:41:31 [Speaker Changed] Or the Wilshire 5,000. It’s like 3,400. 00:41:33 [Speaker Changed] Well there yeah, the WIL 5,000 used to be about 8,000 stocks, and now there’s just fewer stocks that are 00:41:39 [Speaker Changed] Publicly traded. Yep, absolutely. Coming up, we continue our conversation with Liz Ann Saunders, market strategist for Schwab, discussing the current environment. I’m Barry Riol, you’re listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. 00:42:05 I’m Barry Ritholtz, your listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. My extra special guest this week is Liz Ann Saunders. She is the Chief market strategist at Schwab, helping to oversee $11 trillion in change in client assets. So I went back and looked at my notes the last time we had a conversation like this was spring of 2024. It was six months before the election. I don’t think the election surprised many people. Right. It sort of felt like that was inevitable. Maybe that’s a little bit of hindsight bias. How has this year played out since January 20th relative to expectations? 00:42:47 [Speaker Changed] Well, you know, let, let’s focus on not so much the beginning of the year, but the setup going into April 2nd. I think that was a pivotal point because we knew tariffs were coming, but I think there was complacency as to what the announcement would be on April 2nd. An assumption that okay, 10% across the board, tariffs, it’s kind of built into expectations. 00:43:08 [Speaker Changed] You call it complacency. I, I call it a failure of imagination. Yeah. Because afterwards, a 00:43:13 [Speaker Changed] Failure to imagine the Cheesecake Factory menu being held up and reciprocal tariffs of a massive size. Right? Yeah. 00:43:21 [Speaker Changed] Right. Because you think about it, he talked about tariffs. He’s, I called himself tariff man, it’s the most beautiful in the dictionary. None of us imagined that he would just 00:43:31 [Speaker Changed] Overturn the order. And that, and that reciprocity wasn’t about tariffs that other countries had as part of their policy, but reciprocity relative to trade deficits. And the confusion that that brought about, when you think about there are many countries, particularly smaller, 00:43:47 [Speaker Changed] Vietnam is the classic example, 00:43:49 [Speaker Changed] But also, you know, the Madagascar and Bangladesh, right? We’re never going to have a trade surplus. They can’t afford, they buy teen their teeny. And in the case of, you know, a, a place like Madagascar, they produce most of the vanilla in the world that gives them literally and figuratively in industry. And they can’t afford to buy what we export, which is much more value add. So I think that was a big surprise factor. 00:44:13 [Speaker Changed] A math a, it’s effectively a conceptual math error. Yeah. 00:44:17 [Speaker Changed] And of course, running trade deficits. The other side of that is a, a capital account surplus. So we export dollars into the rest of the, the world, right? And those dollars have to be put to work and they get put in treasury 00:44:29 [Speaker Changed] Here, some paper we printed us. 00:44:31 [Speaker Changed] And so I think that became a, a significant concern. I also have been really shocked, Barry, at how the general public doesn’t understand literally who pays the tariffs. 00:44:45 [Speaker Changed] It’s a VAT tax, it’s evaluated tax on consumption’s. 00:44:48 [Speaker Changed] The first time I decided, I was speaking to an audience in Naples, Florida in the spring, that well to do audience. So assuming they have some investment expertise, but we’re not, we’re not deep in the import export business. And I decided, let me just lay out the actual definition of tariffs. I said, notwithstanding the shorthanded headlines of tariffs on China, tariffs on Mexico, fill in the blank. Tariffs are paid by the US company importing the goods. They’re not paid by the targeted country. It is not the case that, as I’ve heard from friends who didn’t understand how this worked, that in order for China to export goods into the United States, China has to pay a tariff to the United States. Barry, do you know how many people came up to me after that event and said, I had no idea. And that’s what’s a little frustrating because there’s still that shorthand. And at times when there are comments made by the administration that, you know, China, again, fill in the blank of the country, paying us more in tariffs. It’s the US company. It’s a tax on US companies. Now, a valid debate is who ultimately bears the cost and is it the exporters that will lower their price to offset the tariff that the US company has to pay? Very little indication that that is happening. And then of course it’s do companies eat it in their profit margins or do they pass it on to 00:46:09 [Speaker Changed] Consumers? But, but either way, either companies are gonna have lower profits, which means the stock market could support a lower PE multiple, or there’s only so many dollars. It’s finite. Right. If, if they’re, so what we saw, we saw this is taking place in three steps in anticipation of the tariffs going into effect. And especially with the 90 day pause on April. 00:46:31 [Speaker Changed] Well, so that was the thing that happened. 00:46:33 [Speaker Changed] So ton of excess import inventory bills 00:46:35 [Speaker Changed] In one week from April 2nd to the intraday low on April 9th. There was sort of a complete about face. So what none of us can do is try to gauge what the next social media post is going to be. Right. There’s been so many fits and starts from a tariff perspective, whether it’s delays, tariffs coming down, exceptions. This has been a, an elongated process. It was certainly wasn’t a moment in time kind of thing. But what we can analyze, especially as a, as a strategist, are the setups. So we already talked about the setup going into April 2nd. Well, the setup shifted very quickly. So you went from complacent sentiment to despairing sentiment. You, 00:47:18 [Speaker Changed] You had a VIX in the low teens that spiked up, spiked to 30, and I want, on the eighth, I wanted to buy. And I’m like, I have no idea what the hell the next tweet is gonna be. Right? Can I really put money in my personal account, put money on at risk that could be destroyed by a 00:47:35 [Speaker Changed] Tweet. But then, then you had the market, technically oversold breath had fully washed out. So then you, that was the attraction was really just incrementally positive news intraday on April 9th off to the races and off to the races, right? But then you had the power of the retail trader and that cohort has become unbelievably power powerful representing somewhere in the 20 to 25% of daily trading volume. And that by the dip mentality was such a fuel for the market. What concerns me a little bit now is if I, I track a lot of the baskets that track like micro baskets of, of stocks. Goldman has a lot of them. UBS has the meme stock basket. You go back to that intraday low on April 9th. And it’s baskets like the memes, non-profitable tech, heavily shorted stocks. That is the perfect example of retail traders kind of powering this market higher. And in the heavily shorted piece of that, it’s also suggestive maybe of retail traders with a little bit of the stick it to the man, which, which drove the initial meme stock CRAs back, back 00:48:36 [Speaker Changed] In 2021 sort of GameStop thing. 00:48:39 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And it’s, it’s alive and well again, it it, it actually has forced institutions in some cases to cover shorts, which has added to the, the fuel. Now, I think as we think about the setup, we’re arguably back in a similar pre-AP April 2nd, a bit of complacency and which may means some vulnerability to the extent you get some sort of negative 00:49:02 [Speaker Changed] Catalyst. So, so that’s where I wanted to go. Since we’re talking about the current environment. It felt like a lot of savvy companies loaded up on inventory in that 90 day pause front, ran the tariffs and Right. Exactly. And then they were capable until that ran down of not really being affected by tariffs. And then even as the tariffs started to bite, they seem, it seemed like they were eating the increase and not passing it along. But that can only go on for so long. It feels like the next phase is consumers are gonna pick it up. 00:49:38 [Speaker Changed] And to your point, Barry, there, there wasn’t much of that eating it at the early stages because of that inventory build by front running the tariffs and building inventories at a low cost basis, providing some time flexibility around when to make the decision of eating it in the profit margins or passing it on to the consumers. We’re now starting to see attempts to pass on to the consumer. But the, maybe the more interesting thing to consider right now is so much focus on goods that are impacted by tariffs. What’s the rate of inflation in those goods? Trying to gauge the tariff impact on the inflation statistics. But what we’re, we’re also starting to see is demand destruction and switching on the part of consumers. So I think we have to analyze the impact of tariffs in a parallel fashion, not just gauging what the inflation impact is. And you can do that by separating out goods and services within the goods categories of an inflation metric like CPI look at those that are directly impacted by tariffs, not impacted by tariffs, but there’s the demand destruction side of things. So we track the weekly consumer spending data, and if you separate that into tariff impacted categories, that’s where you’re seeing a compression in that spending. 00:50:54 [Speaker Changed] So to be fair, when you look at the US as a 30, $31 trillion economy, when you look at the value of imported, and, and by the way, that economy is much more services than goods oriented. And then you look at the percentage of goods that are imported, it’s a trillion or 2 trillion out of, i, I know it sounds crazy to say, yeah, what’s a trillion, but it’s a trillion out of 30 plus trillion dollars. So the worst case scenario is it, it takes a quarter or half a point outta GDP, but probably doesn’t tip us into a recession. Is that a a fair way to describe that? 00:51:30 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, in and of itself it probably doesn’t. But there’s, you know, the feedback loop that happens if company rate labor where if companies, because they don’t have that ability to pass most of it on to consumers in part because of the demand destruction that I’m talking about, then there’s that eating in profit margins. And then does that feed into the labor market side of things? I think that’s why the Fed did what it did. The risk little insurance, the risk management, the insurance cut to try to stem any weakness in the labor market. 00:51:58 [Speaker Changed] So, so let’s talk about those crosscurrents, since you do both markets and the economy. We’ve had a softening labor market at least the past few months. And then the whole, i, I don’t know if that re statement is precise, but it certainly makes it clear we were too optimistic about the labor market over the past four quarters. Inflation, sort of residual sticky inflation that hasn’t come down to the fed’s 2% target. We can argue about whether that really should be a 3% target. But hold that aside. Yet at the same time we sort see corporate profits continue to grow and markets making new all times highs, which that combination expanding profits all time price highs tends to be bullish historically. How do you navigate all of these positives and negatives? Well, 00:52:49 [Speaker Changed] Here’s one way to to think about the connectivity between the market and the economy. I think it’s very circular right now. Or maybe chicken and egg. And what does make me harken back to the late 1990s as a bit of a comp to the current environment is not so much is it a bubble? And there’s more there. There in the AI world, a 00:53:10 [Speaker Changed] Lot of revenue, a lot of process. There’s 00:53:11 [Speaker Changed] Actual denominator in the valuation equation, which not 00:53:14 [Speaker Changed] The clicks case and eyeballs, 00:53:15 [Speaker Changed] Right? Not clicks and eyeballs. Not every company just adding.com, you know, to the end of their name. But the wealth effect and it’s chicken and egg. And what makes me think back to the late 1990s is in that 99 blow off into the peak in 2000, whether it was valuation metrics like the buffet model, which looks at total market cap of all US stocks as a share of total GDP, 00:53:41 [Speaker Changed] Which is at all time highs now, 00:53:43 [Speaker Changed] Which, and way higher than it was back at the peak in 99 or 2000 at the time, households exposure to equities as a share of their financial assets. Well, at an all time high, significantly higher. So if we remember when the market topped out in March of 2000, and then we started what was a two and a half year bear market, we ended up getting a recession declared in 2001. It was a very mild recession. It was one of the proof points, which for what I always say drives me crazy that people think of recession as traditionally or classically defined as two quarters in a row of GDP. That’s never been the definition right. Of recession. Hundred percent. NBER is, that’s 00:54:21 [Speaker Changed] A pet peeve of mine 00:54:22 [Speaker Changed] As well. It drives me crazy. And in fact, oh, one with the benefit of revisions wasn’t two quarters in a row of negative 00:54:28 [Speaker Changed] GDP. That’s right. Same, same thing in 2022 people were talking about it. Right. The revision, the 00:54:33 [Speaker Changed] Revision took out that one plus quarter 00:54:36 [Speaker Changed] Plus when you have a spike in inflation, it’s not that the economy is contracting, it’s that we back out price increases. Right, exactly. The economy is so hot. Exactly. That inflation makes it look negative, right. It’s not, it’s not a contraction, it’s just a price problem. 00:54:51 [Speaker Changed] But that oh one recession was actually very mild, began 00:54:55 [Speaker Changed] In March. I think it ended in October. 00:54:57 [Speaker Changed] It ended in October, right. Short. It was mild. There were, there was not really a financial system crisis for sure. It wasn’t a credit crunch. I think it was the weakness in the stock market caused the economy to contract because of the wealth effect at the time. 00:55:12 [Speaker Changed] I’m gonna take it just a step further. I have vivid recollections of speaking to people, speaking to clients or other people’s clients in 96, 97, 98, 99, who had been in the market for 15, 20 years. Hey, we want to trade up to an ISA house. Hey, we want to buy a beach house, a lake house, a vacation property. And the person said, I’m, I’m not sure if the market’s gonna go higher from here, but I want to pull half a million outta my account and buy real estate. It’s like, Hey, you’re gonna have that house for the next 25, 30 years, even if the market keeps going higher, who cares? You’re sitting on such profits, why not? And so I kind of got a sense that it wasn’t so much the wealth effect as people had already done the big buys before the market crash, which tends to freeze people in place. Yeah. So I saw a lot of rotation out of equities just because people were sitting on, look, from 82 to 2000, the Dow gained a thousand percent. People were taking a little of the house money off the table and letting less the rest ride. And then the.com implosion, I wanna say 82, 80 3% peaked a TR on, on nasdaq. On the queues. Yeah. 00:56:33 [Speaker Changed] 57% on the s and p, you know, 00:56:35 [Speaker Changed] 80 plus percent. And the Dow held up the best because it was least exposed back then. Right, right. Least exposed that before Microsoft and Intel went 00:56:42 [Speaker Changed] Into Intel and price, weight did not cap, right? 00:56:43 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, that’s right. Yeah. So the 00:56:45 [Speaker Changed] World, so I just think we, and again, it’s a bit circular in that, you know, if and when we get another bear market, we essentially had one this year, just missed it on the s and p 00:56:58 [Speaker Changed] 19%. 00:56:58 [Speaker Changed] Think at the index level. Yeah. But the, here’s, here’s another set of statistics. The average max, the average member, maximum drawdown for the s and p year to date is 24%. Hmm. So the average member has had a bear market. Huh. That’s interesting. The average, average member within the NASDAQs maximum drawdown is 47%. Wow. Now you want 00:57:19 [Speaker Changed] Cap weighted. 00:57:21 [Speaker Changed] Well, the average member, just each individual member. So not cap weight, what was there? No, ’cause it’s individual members, right? You just track what each member maximum drawdown was at any point, and then take an average of that. But here’s the maybe more interesting one. In an environment since the April 9th intraday low, we haven’t had much of any kind of pullback in either the s and p or the nasdaq. But just since that low, in an environment where the s and p hasn’t even had a 2% pullback, the average member within the s and p since the closing low on April 8th, has had a 14% maximum draw down. Hmm. And within the NASDAQ has had a 32% maximum drawdown. Wow. So there’s a lot of rotation and churn under the surface, which you don’t pick up if you’re only focused on the index level, which has that cap bias to it. 00:58:07 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. That’s amazing. So last question before I get to my favorites. We we’re talking about a lot of things that are in the headlines. What do you think investors are not thinking about or talking about, but perhaps should be? What topics, assets, data points, you know, are getting overlooked? 00:58:26 [Speaker Changed] There was one I thought about this morning, and it’s not so much what people aren’t talking about, so I’m gonna answer in a different way. It’s what I hear a lot of people talking about that isn’t quite the right way to think about it. And that is the cash on the sidelines argument. Ugh. 00:58:41 [Speaker Changed] So it’s y hated that, and I’m not a fan either, 00:58:44 [Speaker Changed] But it often, the specificity around that has to do with the amount of money in money market, 00:58:49 [Speaker Changed] Seven point something 00:58:51 [Speaker Changed] Trillion, seven 7 trillion in change. Yeah. And that, that is sitting there as either, if not imminent, but ample fuel that if that money decides to repatriate from money markets into the equity market, boy, we go off to the races. 00:59:06 [Speaker Changed] Didn’t that money mostly come from bonds? It 00:59:08 [Speaker Changed] Did. 00:59:08 [Speaker Changed] You’re getting such low yield and bond. So my, 00:59:11 [Speaker Changed] I think a lot of it’s 00:59:12 [Speaker Changed] Sticky. My Schwab money market account last summer, so we bought a house, a beach property in February last summer. I was getting like 5 3, 5 2 in, in the Schwab, what is it? Snacks. Snacks. I don’t even remember the symbol. I’m like, why do I need to mess around with 10 or 20 year bonds when I’m getting much better? 00:59:31 [Speaker Changed] But here’s the other angle to that. If you think of $7 trillion as some massive fuel for the market, you need to look at it as a ratio relative to the total right market capitalization. And 00:59:45 [Speaker Changed] It’s gone up less than the stock 00:59:47 [Speaker Changed] Market has. It’s, it’s only 12%. The all time low in that, in the history that we have for that data is 11%. To put that in context, in oh 8, 0 9, when money was flying into money markets, because it was fleeing the equity market at the peak money market assets relative to the size of the stock market was more than 60%. Huh. 01:00:11 [Speaker Changed] That’s 01:00:11 [Speaker Changed] Huge. Now we’re only at about 12%. So the math is such that even if all $7 trillion was to leave on mass and go into the equity market as a fuel at 12% of total market cap versus say, you know, 63% of total market cap in oh nine, that’s a very different, not to mention back to our initial point, I think a lot of that money is sticky. That was money that was forced out the risk spectrum into other categories within the fixed income market in order to pick up yield when there was none to be had. So I, I don’t think we should consider that some sidelines cash that is just itching to find its way back into the riskier asset classes. 01:00:52 [Speaker Changed] Someone once debunked the cash on the sideline argument, and it might have even been Marty Sweig in winning on Wall Street by explaining it this way. Hey, I’m gonna buy a million dollars worth of stock. It means I have a million dollars worth of cash, but no stock. I buy a million of the SPY, now I have the SPY. Right? And, and, and they have a million on of cash 01:01:16 [Speaker Changed] For every buyer. There’s a seller. The 01:01:18 [Speaker Changed] The, there’s no cash on the sideline. It just changes hands. It just changes the same dollar amount. So it’s been one of those things that has persisted forever. 01:01:25 [Speaker Changed] And that also the more buyers than sellers. No, no, no, no. 01:01:29 [Speaker Changed] So that you, you are tagging all my, my favorite pet peeves. 01:01:33 [Speaker Changed] I mean, there’s maybe more enthusiasm on the buy side versus the enthusiasm, but there’s no more buyers and sellers or vice versa for every buyer 01:01:41 [Speaker Changed] That’s a seller. But my head trader used to say, there are more buyers and sellers at this level. And now you go up to the nice price next price level where there are matching number of buyers and sellers and the price stabilizes. Right. If a price is going up, okay, at that particular do at at 27 55, there may be more buyers in stock for sale. But at 27 75, then you, you’ve, that’s how you end up with price stability. So yeah. More buyers and sellers. No, no. They’re an equal amount of buyers and sellers. That’s how the other line I love has been trade takes place where there’s a disagreement about value, but an agreement on price. Hmm. And that seems to really Yeah. E explain that. Yeah. All right. I like that one. I have to get you out to, to catch your plane. So I only have you for a limited amount of time. Let’s, let’s speed through our favorite questions. Starting with, tell us about your mentors who help helped shape your career. I’m pretty sure I know the two 01:02:37 [Speaker Changed] Shocker. Marty Zweig. Yeah. Chuck Schwab. 01:02:40 [Speaker Changed] Okay. And 01:02:41 [Speaker Changed] In the world 01:02:41 [Speaker Changed] Of, by the way, not not too shabby 01:02:43 [Speaker Changed] Mentors. Right. Not too shabby mentors. Yeah. Boy was I lucky. And I will say in the world of media, another name we’ve already touched on, Louis Ru Kaiser. One of the best pieces of advice he gave me was, was one, I was on the show for the first time as a guest, and he was saying hello to me for the first time, welcomed me onto the show. This was off camera. And he asked me whether my parents were still alive and whether they were finance people. And I said, Nope, far from it. He said, okay, when you come out here and do the interview with me, get them to understand what you’re talking about. And that was such a, a moment of, okay, get people to understand what you’re talking 01:03:19 [Speaker Changed] About. That’s so funny. You say that. Great advice. You say that my mom was a real estate agent. My wife is an art teacher. And it’s always make them understand it. Yeah. Right. Don’t, don’t don’t clutter it up with jargon. That’s right. Make it hundred percent. That’s interesting that it was, it was Ru Kai who said that. Let’s talk about books. I mentioned Wags winning on Wall Street. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading right 01:03:40 [Speaker Changed] Now? So, my favorite, so I’m not reading a book right now. I, I must say I don’t have a lot of time. I read constantly. I drink from a fire hose of information, but it tends to be, you know, like reports 01:03:51 [Speaker Changed] And 01:03:52 [Speaker Changed] Analysis reports and deep dive fed research. And, but my favorite book of all time, and it is market related, is reminiscences of a Stock Operator. Sure. Absolute favorite. I I tell young people to buy it all the time. It still resonates today. And you 01:04:07 [Speaker Changed] Substitute AI for railroads and telegraphs. Exactly. And it, it’s the same story. 01:04:13 [Speaker Changed] It’s the same. It’s the same story. But I am a big podcast listener, so that’s the longer form way, including masters in business. Well, thank you that I absorb information beyond the traditional drivers that come into my inbox. Literally. 01:04:30 [Speaker Changed] It’s easy when you’re traveling, if you’re on a plane or a car. I just find it so easy. Yeah. Alright, so you told us what you’re, what po what other podcasts are you listening to? What are you watching on Hulu and Netflix or 01:04:40 [Speaker Changed] Amazon? Well, I, I listen to Masters in business. I love Grant Williams series of podcasts. I love ’em because they’re long form and they’re big picture and top down. My, my favorite non-inverting podcast is Smartless. I just love those 01:04:55 [Speaker Changed] Guys. Those guys are great. They’re 01:04:56 [Speaker Changed] Great. They’re, they’re so fun. 01:04:58 [Speaker Changed] I’m gonna tell you, I listened. I’ve had Michael Lewis on the podcast at Dawson 01:05:03 [Speaker Changed] Times. I have, I have met and have interviewed Michael Lewis on stage at Schwab’s Impact Conference. 01:05:08 [Speaker Changed] And, and the story he told, and I’m not even gonna mention it, the story he told on Smartless about a family tragedy was just, it 01:05:17 [Speaker Changed] Was unbelievable. And what Right. What his friend said to him, or his therapist said to him, the reason why you’re so exhausted after this life’s tragedy is in your mind, you’re rewriting the future without, without her. Without her. Right. It’s crazy. And that was such a, a, a moment of Wow. But yeah, that was one of the most impactful interviews 01:05:36 [Speaker Changed] I’ve heard that, that I, that stayed with me for a long time 01:05:38 [Speaker Changed] In terms of what I’m watching. Well, morning Show just started back up again. Yeah. So we get back into that four four, and I loved Department Q. 01:05:46 [Speaker Changed] So did I. That was so good. 01:05:47 [Speaker Changed] It was intense. 01:05:48 [Speaker Changed] It was a little slow, but they really, it really paid off, if you like Department Q There’s a movie, I wanna say it’s on Netflix called Black Bag. That’s the same I’ve heard about it. Same sort of I’ve heard about it. Espionage thing. Yes. Yeah. And I walked in on my wife watching Killing Eve. 01:06:10 [Speaker Changed] That was great. 01:06:11 [Speaker Changed] Which she’s like, told it was great. Like, I’m like, oh, 01:06:14 [Speaker Changed] This is Queen Gambit was great. 01:06:15 [Speaker Changed] There’s, there’s been a ton of stuff. Yeah. We, we just finished the Gilded Age, which is 01:06:19 [Speaker Changed] Oh yeah. Which, that’s 01:06:20 [Speaker Changed] Feels modern. 01:06:22 [Speaker Changed] I’m obsessed with that era in New York City. Oh really? I have every book written about it. I’m just so, so that is so right up my alley. 01:06:30 [Speaker Changed] So we watched The Crown, but we never watched Doubt Abbey. And people said, oh, loved it. Loved it. Oh, you like Gilded Age in the Crown. Doubt Abbey is, absolutely. So that’s on my, and during the Pandemic, I had never seen a single episode of Mad Men. And that was mind blowing to watch that. Yeah, that’s a good one. That felt like more like a documentary. Yeah. It’s fun 01:06:48 [Speaker Changed] To go back and watch some of the old 01:06:49 [Speaker Changed] Shows. Yeah, absolutely. All right, our last two questions. Okay. We’ll get you outta here on time. A recent college grad is interested in the career in investing or doing market strategy. What sort of adv advice would you give them? 01:07:01 [Speaker Changed] Well, the world you live in and indirectly I live in on the advisor side, that’s an incredible growth area in the broader realm of financial services, independent RIAs, wealth management firms, even the wealth management divisions at the big wirehouse firms because it’s essentially a first generation business. And so there’s a lot of succession planning happening right now. And I, I think for young investors, that’s such a great avenue to go in more generic advice that I give young people, especially as they embark on the networking and interview part of the process is be way more focused on being interested than being interesting. Hmm. Don’t go in there and say, here’s all the fabulous things have I done? Especially if it’s, that’s limited to an undergraduate education, but be interested, ask questions, be engaged, show the enthusiasm. That way you’re not bringing something into the mix by virtue of what you know, econ, you know, 2 0 8 course you took that they think, oh God, we have to hire this person. ’cause we don’t know anything about that. So we’re bringing it’s is be interested. 01:08:06 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really interesting. And our final question. What do you know about the world of investing today? You wish you knew back in the 1980s when, when you were first getting started? 01:08:17 [Speaker Changed] It, it seemed to be a little bit easier to analyze markets in that day using kind of traditional stuff. Models to think now about how much more of an influence there is of geopolitics and macro and how much more complicated an ecosystem. Not to mention the channels of information that occur through social media. I, I kind of wish it was back to what at the time didn’t feel terribly simple, but I think then was a little bit more simple and more concrete in terms of what drives markets. I think there’s more psychology now with a wider band of what that means and what that represents. And it would’ve been interesting to kind of know that in advance the little birdie landing on your shoulder saying here, here’s what, here’s what I don’t know. If I would’ve believed that 40 years from that point, I’d still be doing this, but just how much more complex an ecosystem that the markets live in these days. Huh. 01:09:19 [Speaker Changed] Really interesting. Lizanne, as always delightful. Thank you so much for being 01:09:23 [Speaker Changed] So generous 01:09:24 [Speaker Changed] With your time.
