Chinese AI company DeepSeek released an AI model that is sending shockwaves through the US tech industry due to its low cost and high performance. Tech investor Marc Andreessen calls it "AI's Sputnik moment," causing US tech stocks to tumble this morning, with Nvidia the hardest hit, down 11%. The app surpassed ChatGPT on the Apple App Store as the most-downloaded free application. But after receiving a flood of registrations and "large-scale malicious attacks"—possibly a DDoS attack—DeepSeek has "temporarily" restricted access to those with a +86 mainland Chinese phone number. You may still be able to sign in with a Google account. We downloaded it from the app store before this, and found the interface nearly identical to ChatGPT. It currently has a knowledge cutoff of October 2023, as shown in the screenshot below. But the big game-changer is not the chatbot experience but the open-source model that powers it on the backend. It appears to be the highest-performing available for an ultra-low price. Being open source, anyone with the right skills can download it and use it. The model, dubbed R1, came out on Jan. 20, a few months after DeepSeek released its first model. The company says its performance is "on par with OpenAI-o1,” the model OpenAI debuted in September 2024 with the ability to follow a chain of thought. The company called the approach a "new paradigm" that would bring AI models closer to human-level intelligence. Looking at the pricing specs for the DeepSeek R1 reasoner model and OpenAI's GPT-o1, you'll see R1 is a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek charges $2.19 per 1 million output tokens, compared to $60 for GPT-o1. Even OpenAI's mini version of GPT-o1, which is intended to be a lightweight, more affordable version, costs $12. Like DeepSeek, Meta has made open source its central AI strategy with its Llama models, which are currently free. "To people who see the performance of DeepSeek and think, 'China is surpassing the US in AI.' You are reading this wrong," says Meta's chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, on Threads. "The correct reading is: 'Open source models are surpassing proprietary ones.'" Meta has set up four war rooms to analyze DeepSeek’s technology, focusing on how the company reduced training costs and what data it may have used, according to The Information. There is some controversy over the chips that power R1. DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng, a 40-year-old businessman, reportedly stocked up on Nvidia A100 chips before they were banned from export to China in September 2022. DeepSeek claims R1 runs on lower-capacity Nvidia H800 chips, but it's difficult to know exactly what is going on behind closed doors, especially since A100 chips are still being snuck into China in violation of US sanctions. "Rather than weakening China’s AI capabilities, the sanctions appear to be driving startups like DeepSeek to innovate in ways that prioritize efficiency, resource-pooling, and collaboration," says the MIT Technology Review. The constrained chip supply may have forced the company to place a premium on efficient computing from the start of development. More efficient computing also means less energy use—a welcome innovation given AI's astronomical energy needs. Why has Nvidia's stock price tumbled, even though DeepSeek is still using its chips? Because its AI model does more with less. US tech companies are now coming under fire for a potentially bloated approach to AI development, requiring more and more chips, while being less efficient with them than DeepSeek appears to be. Last week, President Donald Trump announced that Oracle, OpenAI, and Softbank would spearhead a $500 billion investment in AI data centers with the Stargate Project. Data collection is another concern with DeepSeek. Like TikTok, the company is obligated to share user data with the Chinese government if it requests it. The privacy policy lists the data it collects, and how it will use it, including to "comply with our legal obligations." As an open-source platform, that means US companies may feed it their data in addition to everyday chatbot users. I'm the expert at PCMag for all things electric vehicles and AI.

Title: DeepSeek Surges on App Store: What Is the Chinese AI Model and Why Is It a Big Deal?
URL: https://www.thewrap.com/deepseek-what-is-it-chinese-artificial-intelligence-model/
Time Published: 2025-01-27T16:52:19Z

China’s artificial intelligence company jumped past OpenAI’s ChatGPT on the Apple App Store after releasing two new models DeepSeek sent shock waves through the artificial intelligence world this past weekend and Wall Street on Monday. If you follow the tech industry even sparingly — or happened to jump on X or the App Store recently — you likely saw the name. But what is DeepSeek, and what is the big deal all about? Let’s jump into it. For starters, DeepSeek is a Chinese AI company and research lab that creates open-source large language models, or LLMs. Open-source LLMs are AI models that allow others to build on its technology. X’s Grok and Meta’s Llama are some other well-known open-source LLMs, while OpenAI’s ChatGPT is the most popular closed-source LLM. Why Is It In the News? DeepSeek released its R1 and R1-Zero reasoning models on Jan. 20, and their capabilities quickly gained notice in the tech and AI worlds. In particular, there are two key aspects to DeepSeek’s latest releases: 1) Refined Reinforcement DeepSeek’s model uses a technique called Reinforcement — where a model makes decisions to achieve a certain goal — that goes beyond other models. That is because it does not use human feedback to refine itself, which other models do. As Ben Thompson of the tech-focused Stratechery blog put it succinctly: “LLMs to date, however, have relied on reinforcement learning with human feedback; humans are in the loop to help guide the model, navigate difficult choices where rewards aren’t obvious, etc… R1-Zero, however, drops the HF part — it’s just reinforcement learning.” 2) Distillation Another important factor here is DeepSeek’s distillation technique. Distillation is where a smaller model like DeepSeek is able to lift the information from larger models, while also using less memory and computing power. This also helps cut down on costs. DeepSeek said its recent breakthroughs cost less than $6 million and took less than two months to build. Why Is This a Big Deal? From a macro standpoint, it shows that China — remember, China’s communist government is closely linked to all of its companies, especially the major tech firms that branch out into different markets — is further along in AI innovation than many had thought. And DeepSeek’s performance is particularly noteworthy, given its low cost and its ability to navigate around chip restrictions that were rolled out by former President Joe Biden. Marc Andreessen, co-founder of the tech-focused Andreessen Horowitz venture capital firm, called it AI’s “sputnik moment” on Sunday. Competitors DeepSeek has crashed an already-crowded AI space. It leapfrogged ChatGPT in the Apple App Store as the most-downloaded free app this weekend, indicating there is strong user interest in what DeepSeek can do. Many analysts believe DeepSeek, and what is means about Chinese AI capabilities, was the main reason the U.S. stock market was down on Monday morning, with the S&P 500 dropping 1.72% in the first 90 minutes of trading. Meta, which announced on Friday it would be investing $60 billion-$65 billion to fuel its AI business, was not hit by the Monday drop, with its share price climbing about 1.5% in early trading. Google, which has its own AI model, Gemini, did see its stock price drop about 2.5%, while Tesla was down 1%, although its business is obviously more than just its AI component. Microsoft, OpenAI’s partner, saw its stock price drop 3.7%. The biggest hit was to Nvidia, which supplies chips and other important tech that undergirds AI development. Its stock price was down 14.8% in the first hour and a half of trading on Monday. Censorship? To reinforce that DeepSeek is ultimately beholden to China’s government, many noted this weekend that its model will not answer certain questions on topics the CCP is not a fan of — like the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. This is similar to how TheWrap recently found “Little Red Book,” aka “RedNote,” would censor content about Tiananmen Square or China’s treatment of the Uyghurs.

Title: Investors betting on the Trump trade may be missing some real risks

I'm back! Fresh off my trip to Davos I'm jumping right into it. DeepSeek's AI models are spooking tech stocks this morning. The Chinese AI lab has been rolling out new models in recent weeks, and they're cheaper than rival OpenAI's. DeepSeek's models are open-source, which means they're available for anyone who wants to use them for free. That's a challenge to OpenAI, which keeps its top models proprietary, and charges premium prices for them. In a paper released last Monday, DeepSeek unveiled a new flagship AI model called R1 that shows off a new level of "reasoning" — and it has left much of America's top industry researchers stunned. DeepSeek hit No. 1 on the Apple App Store's Top Free Apps Chart days later. It's the latest disruption in AI, and markets are feeling the shock, with Nvidia down by more than 10% premarket on Monday. Meanwhile, in today's newsletter, we're focusing on investors' exuberance over the new administration has some wondering if people are getting ahead of themselves. What's on deck Markets: Multistrat hedge funds just can't quit Manhattan. Tech: VC Twitter has found a new love — LinkedIn. Business: Breakfast isn't getting cheaper anytime soon thanks to the price of eggs. But first, hot out the gates. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. There are plenty of uncertainties with the new administration. How investors feel about Donald Trump's pro-business agenda isn't one of them. Stocks reached record highs during the president's first week in office, and there's plenty of hope that it's just the beginning. Trump's consistent message of deregulation and lower corporate taxes has investors excited about the resulting growth potential. Some in the market, however, aren't as convinced. Business Insider's Jennifer Sor has a story on how investors might be wearing Trump-tinted glasses that are hiding some real risks. Much of the concern stems from persistently high interest rates, worries that were pushed aside last week as investors focused on Trump's pro-growth agenda. And while the aggressiveness of Trump's tariff policy remains unclear, many believe it will eventually push inflation higher, further dampening views of stimulative rate cuts. While the market has elected to look past elevated rates, the ever-important 10-year Treasury yield crept up as much as 13 basis points during the four-day week. The US market has the benefit of somewhat being the only game in town, though. European economies are in a much weaker position than the US, which dents the future earnings potential of companies there. And the threat of more regulation makes them even less inviting. China's economy, meanwhile, is struggling to mount a comeback. It's also one of Trump's biggest foreign targets. And while there's always a chance of reconciliation, that's a risky bet. Still, the US stock market is heavily concentrated in mega-cap tech names, which some see as a looming risk. Albert Edwards, a famously bearish strategist, shared three charts that illustrate how top-heavy things are, writes BI's Will Edwards. But investors seem willing to keep betting on the US. Meanwhile, with only one term to implement his plan, Trump has no time to waste. That means businesses (and the people investing in them) will just need to prepare for a bit of a bumpy ride. BI's John L. Dorman, Brent D. Griffiths, and Bryan Metzger have a breakdown of all the shockwaves Trump has already sent through corporate America during his first week. Trump and Musk are at odds again. This time over the UK prime minister. 1. New York City is still the center of the hedge fund universe. Despite interest in sunnier places like Miami, regulatory filings reveal most portfolio managers at multistrategy hedge funds work from the Big Apple. That includes funds like Balyasny, Citadel, and Point72, which are headquartered elsewhere. 2. Inside the routine and leadership style of a Citadel partner. Micah Nance runs a team of nine analysts and associates that covers about 150 tech and media companies out of the hedge fund's Dallas office. He spoke to BI about his 13 years climbing the ranks at the high-profile firm, how he manages his time, and some career advice. 3. Here come the crypto hires. The market and regulators are both getting behind digital assets again. As a result, both fintechs and traditional finance firms are staffing up. 1. The Zuckermoon is over. The Meta CEO was on the precipice of becoming cool after his major makeover and "wife guy" revamp. But he's lost brownie points with some since dealing blows to Meta's fact-checking system, writes BI's Katie Notopoulos. The comments section — and even AI's opinion — is ruthless. 2. The buzz around voice AI. The tech isn't new, but investors are excited about its vast use cases and recent rapid sophistication. BI spoke to investors about the untapped opportunities they see in the sector, from real-time audio transcriptions to generating synthetic voices. 3. VC Twitter takes LinkedIn. Though X remains the platform of choice for venture capitalists, they're starting to post more on LinkedIn. VCs told BI they see better "ROI" on their posts on the workplace social-networking site, and that it's where business can actually get done. 1. Cheap eggs aren't on the horizon. Bird flu isn't going anywhere, and it's limiting supply. Meanwhile, a surge in consumer "egg-citement" is driving demand. A push to treat chickens better isn't cheap, either — and it's all reflected in the current egg prices. 2. Eli Lilly's weight-loss wonders. The Mounjaro and Zepbound producer hopes to close the gap with competitor Novo Nordisk's Ozempic — and take things a step further. Eli Lilly's head of obesity teased a pill to rival Ozempic and a triple-threat "King Kong" injection to mimic bariatric surgery. The ultimate dream: a once-per-year weight-loss shot. 3. Gen Z is already fed up with work — and it's not about laziness. Less than a third of young American workers felt engaged at their job last year, a report from Gallup found. The younger generation hasn't wasted time taking a transactional view of work, BI's Aki Ito wrote. However, with low engagement costing businesses $9 trillion a year worldwide, employers need to step it up. I'm the CEO of a multibillion-dollar company. These seven lessons have shaped my success.

Title: Truth Social: On the Still-Human Films of Sohrab Hura

The Lost Head and the Bird (Sohrab Hura, 2018). “We are excited to announce insulin is free now.” At first glance, this November 2022 Twitter post from @EliLillyandCo appeared to be a legitimate announcement from the pharmaceutical company; the account’s profile featured an icon of Eli Lilly and Company’s logo and a blue check mark that, until the previous day, signified the account had been formally verified by the platform’s dedicated staff. But in the hands of new owner Elon Musk, who completed his acquisition of the platform two weeks earlier, Twitter’s verification process underwent significant modification. Suddenly, verification was available to anyone with an authenticated phone number and a willingness to pay $8 a month for the platform’s Premium plan. Twitter, soon to be rebranded as X, inevitably descended into chaos, rife with impersonators and misinformation. Eli Lilly’s stock share price fell by 4.37 percent in one day. What, above all, this episode seemed to signal was the breakdown of institutional responsibility. Prioritizing revenue over accountability, Twitter abandoned any pretense that it would be an arbiter of authenticity; Meta recently followed suit, announcing on January 7 of this year that it would be ditching its fact-checkers in favor of a crowdsourced system of community notes. In our era of “post-truth” politics, images and videos have become laden with new economies of meaning, not all of them based in fact. Social media platforms, as we have seen time and time again, are not neutral mediators but actively influence the reception of content—whether by amplifying certain narratives through algorithmic promotion, stripping or adding context via content labels, or allowing virality to determine credibility. You’ll find a similar line of interest in the crisp, hyper-saturated pictures of the Indian photographer and filmmaker Sohrab Hura, whose recent projects take up a study of synthetic images and how they are distributed. He began working this way as a direct response to the 2004 Indian election, in which the Bharatiya Janata Party’s ultranationalism and “India Shining” slogan aimed to project an image of an economically strong and empowered country—one far from the reality lived by many Indians, especially those in rural areas. Returning to power in 2014 with Narendra Modi as prime minister, the BJP undertook an even more aggressive campaign of propaganda and distortion. V. K. Singh, a cabinet minister, has referred to journalists as “presstitutes.” Modi claims to have once worked as a humble tea seller on a railway platform, though a 2015 Right to Information query cast doubt on his story. Campaign video for Manoj Tiwari, a BJP candidate for parliament, appears to show him speaking English and Haryanvi, the latter a direct appeal to Delhi’s large population of migrant workers. When it was revealed that the original speech was in Hindi, and that the other versions were AI-assisted deepfakes, the BJP dismissed the episode as an experiment. Sohrab Hura, Remains of the day, 2024. Soft pastel on paper. Courtesy of the artist and Experimenter, Kolkata and Mumbai. Surreal times call for surrealist art. Mother, now on view at MoMA PS1 in New York, is the first US survey of Hura’s work. It orchestrates a kaleidoscope of images and sounds, plunging viewers into a maelstrom of ambiguity where truth is indistinguishable from fiction. Single-channel videos flash and whir, suffused with a palpable anxiety. His lurid pastel illustrations and paintings in gouache and acrylics show some fidelity to photography, composed like snapshots or selfies. Together, these varied forms of practice seem to ask if some mediums are more inclined to capture reality than others. In Mother, we find not just Hura’s inquiry into the self, but into his motherland. Things Felt but Not Quite Expressed, a collection of Hura’s illustrations with sardonically self-referential titles, was created between 2022 and 2024, when he was experiencing a disconnect from the fixed nature of photography, moving from image to illustration to capture the idiosyncrasies of quotidian life in an increasingly polarized world. A meme of a French bulldog captioned “Men over 35 in skinny jeans”; impressionistic lashings of bright color; a portrait of a refugee Palestinian couple lying idly in a Syrian field—the art of Things Felt is by turns dreamy, hilarious, and deeply moving. It also speaks to Hura’s recent efforts to consolidate emotional truth into his images. Photographic glitches allow Hura to explore the manipulation and distortion of meaning in a world increasingly dominated by algorithm-driven images. A glitch could be as simple as the warping of a scanned photo, or the telltale signs of some crude Photoshopping. (Think of the hysteria that Princess Catherine’s doctored Mother’s Day photo caused earlier this year and the very meme-able apology that followed: “Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing.”) Hura views these glitches as “fault lines of doubt,” spaces that allow new layers of understanding to emerge.1 They “have this ability to give us a sense of the real in an increasingly fake world," he explains, pointing to the onslaught of edited images we are exposed to daily.2 As AI and algorithms generate more viral content, he believes the future of photography and film lies in these mistakes and accidents, indissoluble from human nature. The Lost Head and the Bird (Sohrab Hura, 2018). Hura works to draw out that fluidity in his films, too. In The Lost Head and the Bird (2018), the artist induces sensory overload through a rapid-fire montage of found footage—images of Bollywood stars, right-wing propaganda, and bloody violence—all interleaved with Hura’s own photographs. The intensity of this visual barrage is amplified by a frenetic soundtrack by Hannes d’Hoine and Sjoerd Bruil, which disrupts our ability to accurately interpret what we see. The film takes its name from the surreal one-page story and photo series published in Hura’s book The Coast (2019), which introduces Madhu, a pitiful woman whose head was stolen by a jealous ex-lover as her pet bird escaped its cage. In the film, a fortune teller sells Madhu a crow, having convinced her that it’s a parrot with a bad cough. The final character in the story, Hura explains, is himself: the photographer, complicit in this violence and deception. In implicating himself, he also implicates the viewer in this voyeurism, claiming that “both of us are helping circulate these images,” blurring the lines between participant and observer.3 Watching The Lost Head is a borderline hallucinatory experience. An iteration of the project for MoMA in 2021 featured twelve versions of the film accompanied by unnerving short stories, each a slight variation of the one that came before. By subtly changing our understanding of Madhu in each retelling, Hura plays with our instinct to trust photographic images and escalates the viewer’s confusion. Confounding any notion of objectivity, he evinces how meaning can be warped not just by manipulating images but also through the sequencing of information. The Coast (Sohrab Hura, 2020). Using footage and stills taken after religious celebrations in a coastal village in Tamil Nadu, The Coast (2020) retains this slightly surreal quality, though its narrative is far more tightly controlled. The project began as a photobook in 2018, and the film develops the original concept by embracing a plurality of forms, using the margin between land and water as a point of release to explore the undercurrents of religious, sexual, and caste-related violence along India’s coastline. The intimate footage transitions from sacred communal fervor to quiet, unsettling moments of post-festival reflection, in which bodies and spaces take on an otherworldly quality. Once again, Hura manipulates context by covertly adding and removing details to blur lines between reality and artifice; his harsh, unforgiving flash creates visuals that mirror the fragmented, fetishistic language of social media images. In The Coast, this litany is brought to life by shots of India’s shoreline, deployed throughout Hura’s work as a metaphor for a society on the brink of collapse. But here, the sea also manifests as a site of religious ritual as demonic masquerades, bloodletting, scenes of destitution, deformity, and anguish unfold. At first, the lapping waves seethe with libidinal energy, then the film gradually transitions to more serene images of darkened figures diving into the ocean, submitting to its primal force. This climactic moment, when the sea collides with grainy, ecstatic bodies, offers them release from artifice in their heightened psychospiritual state. As Hura puts it, “nothing is definite, everything is raw and overwhelming.” While The Lost Head islaced with references to Ganesha, The Coast affects allusions to religion more literally as festivalgoers masquerade as different deities, entering a trancelike frenzy as their bodies hit the water, which washes away their face paint. Hura explains that in India, “perhaps more so than anywhere else, fiction, stories … live longer than factual stories. They are allegories that people return to, constants in the ongoing turbulence of politics, religion, and caste.”4 This idea of enduring allegories seems especially pertinent in a time when religious narratives are increasingly distorted and weaponized. The BJP, for example, has made incendiary anti-Muslim rhetoric integral to its political strategy. During the 2024 election, the party explicitly framed themselves as defenders of Hindu interests, portraying Muslims as an external threat. In May 2024, civil and corporate watchdog groups submitted fake advertisements to Meta as a test of their filtering mechanisms: one proclaimed that “Hindu blood is spilling, these invaders must be burned,” while another called for the execution of a rival political leader. Both were approved to appear on Facebook and Instagram. Pati (Sohrab Hura, 2010). Given Hura’s deliberate shift away from aesthetic objectivity in recent years, it’s interesting that his earlier work is marked by an earnest confidence in film’s potential for truth-telling. His first film, Pati (2010), is an eleven-minute black-and-white documentary featuring barren landscapes—the aftermath of deforestation and deprivation—in the village of Pati, Madhya Pradesh. Collating photos taken in 2005, the projectchronicles the final push from activists, students, academics, journalists, and artists campaigning for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act: a landmark bill that, once implemented, guaranteed 100 days per year of minimum-wage employment for all adult members of a rural household. One particularly moving scene shows children working at a construction site. “Life is not the easiest for [them],” says Hura in voice-over. “There is no respite for anyone over here, and any hand is a helping hand, no matter how small it is.” Pati’s framing of children’s resilience here shares an edifying quality with Francis Alÿs’s Children’s Games video series (1999–), which also looks to make sense of injustice through the eyes of the innocent. While Alÿs films with an anthropological closeness, Hura instead draws attention to his role as the “idiot photographer”: a spectator all too aware of his role in the complicity and cruelty required to make such images.5 Yet his self-awareness doesn’t necessarily absolve him; by foregrounding his own position, Hura risks turning ethical scrutiny into an aesthetic device, one that allows the film to acknowledge its own voyeurism without disrupting it. In this way, Pati becomes complicit in the very structures of image-making it seeks to expose. Bittersweet (Sohrab Hura, 2019). In an earlier short, Bittersweet (2019), Hura initially resisted this impulse to question the ethical place of the photographer. Documenting Hura’s life over ten years, the film focuses on his mother—diagnosed with acute paranoid schizophrenia when he was seventeen—and her relationship with her dog, Elsa. Here, his discomfort was more personal, shaped by his dual role as both son and photographer. Looking back on the film in 2019, he explained his early reluctance to share this work: I didn’t want to feel vulnerable. I didn’t want others to look at her in pity or shock. At the time I had thought that I was being protective of her, but I soon realized that I was actually being protective of myself. How they might have looked at my mother would also define how they looked at me and that scared me. But how could I continue to parachute into someone else’s life and photograph another mother when I couldn’t photograph my own? I had started to feel sure that I needed to turn the camera on myself. I felt that I needed to earn my right to photograph someone else’s life by first putting my own out there with nothing held back.6 In that sense, Bittersweet functions like an eerie family album: grainy, overexposed photos overlaid with discordant sounds, produced by transforming light exposure readings of the scanned photos into sound frequencies. Like synaptic connections, the images weave together fragments of his mother’s fractured reality, allowing the viewer the impression of witnessing a schizophrenic episode through intrusive snapshots. Sometimes she smokes, looking melancholic; sometimes she lies in bed, smiling with Elsa. While Bittersweet remains Hura’s most personal—certainly his most vulnerable—work to date, it represents a significant shift in his engagement with reality. As he questions the boundaries between personal exposure and public consumption, Hura moves beyond mere documentation, instead drawing the viewer into his intimate, subjective experience and the complex social processes through which images are consumed and interpreted. Today, Hura's work takes on a new urgency. Meta plans to populate its platforms with AI-generated users; there has been a surge in harassment, hate speech, and misinformation since Musk’s takeover of X. (And that’s without accounting for the platform’s role in aiding Trump secure the US Presidency, or Musk’s attempts to wade into British politics.) None of this is new thematic territory for Hura, though, who has spoken about the political ramifications of digitally altered images for years. “With algorithms and AI now making most of these viral videos and images—and this is only going to get more prolific and perverse—I feel the future of photography lies in its glitches,” he observes. “As photographers, we will make mistakes, and accidents will happen, and these will help us remember that we are still human.”7 Hura’s art toys with the manipulability of images and their contexts, challenging viewers to chart the hidden codes and meanings embedded within them. In his films, we find a madness that asks us to suspend our belief while drawing us in deeper: we find a world in disarray, much like our own. Don't miss our latest features and interviews.

Jan 27, 2025 Matthew Hare, CEO of Zzoomm (left) shakes on the merger deal with James Warner, CEO of FullFibre. In today’s industry news roundup: UK fibre altnets Zzoomm and FullFibre have agreed to combine their businesses and assets; more big names are putting forward their massive AI datacentre plans; DeepSeek’s low-cost approach to GenAI causes chaos in the AI and chip world; and much more! UK fibre broadband altnet Zzoomm, which last September ​​hired advisors to help it find potential merger partners in a bid to gain scale, has struck an M&A deal with fellow altnet FullFibre. The combined company will have a network that reaches 600,000 UK properties, more than 65,000 paying customers, and will “be well positioned for further M&A,” according to this announcement from FullFibre, which has previously expanded as a result of a merger with another fibre network builder, Digital Infrastructure. Financial details of the deal were not shared. Zzoomm’s CEO, Matthew Hare, will become executive chairman of the combined company, while James Warner, currently CEO of FullFibre, will be group CEO. “The merged entity combines two complementary networks and operating models,” noted FullFibre. “This will create significant opportunities to accelerate customer growth across a larger footprint, secure funding for new builds and future mergers, and achieve greater operational and financial efficiencies through economies of scale,” it added. The deal is subject to “final documentation execution and regulatory approval” but this is expected in the next few months. Zzoomm’s Hare noted: “We have consistently stated our strategy is to grow organically and by M&A in this fragmented market. [As] an enlarged business with the operational and financial infrastructure, benefitting from the economies of scale, as well as a management team with an exceptional track record, we will have an excellent platform to combine with other altnets in the near future as well as driving organic growth faster.” FullFibre’s Warner added: “With a shared commitment to delivering transformational full fibre connectivity with exceptional customer experience, this deal strengthens our collective ability to grow even faster and seize new market opportunities. For FullFibre, this is our second merger and another milestone in our mission to create a 21st-century digital backbone for the nation. Following our recent successful integration with Digital Infrastructure and BeFibre, this next merger further accelerates our ambitions to lead the market and provide unmatched connectivity to homes, businesses, and wholesale partners alike.” In what looks like a response to the Stargate Project AI infrastructure plans announced last week by OpenAI, SoftBank and others, Meta’s chairman, CEO and majority owner Mark Zuckerberg, has taken to his company’s Threads social media platform to announce a significant increase in infrastructure investment this year and plans for a datacentre that with processing capacity of more than 2 gigawatts “is so large it would cover a significant part of Manhattan”. In this Threads post, Zuckerberg stated that Meta will “bring online [about] 1 gigawatt of compute” and “end the year with more than 1.3 million GPUs. We’re planning to invest $60 to $65bn in capex this year while also growing our AI teams significantly, and we have the capital to continue investing in the years ahead. This is a massive effort, and over the coming years it will drive our core products and business, unlock historic innovation, and extend American technology leadership.” Forbes noted that the capex figure is way above the $51bn expected by Wall Street analysts and a giant leap up from the projected 2024 full year capex of $38.4bn. Meanwhile, reports continue to emerge of how Stargate’s backers intend to fund the giant project. OpenAI and SoftBank are believed to be pumping an initial $19bn each into the planned deployments, leaving the stakeholders some way short of the $100bn they stated was ready to be deployed with immediate effect. In addition, Nikkei Asia reported that Masayoshi Son, the CEO of SoftBank (which is responsible for Stargate’s funding strategy), is to approach investment firms Apollo Global Management and Brookfield about funding the initiative’s AI datacentres. While that saga continues, India’s Reliance Industries is keen to play a role in the global race to build staggering volumes of datacentre capacity. According to Bloomberg, Reliance plans to build the world’s largest AI datacentre in Jamnagar with a capacity of 3 gigawatts, a move that will cost up to $30bn. According to Bloomberg, the world’s largest datacentre currently is a 600 megawatts site in Virginia, US. Reliance is one of a number of Indian tech giants (along with Tata Communications and Tech Mahindra) that have already developed relationships with AI chip giant Nvidia, which noted during its AI Summit event in Mumbai last October that Reliance is working with Nvidia to build “AI factories to automate industrial tasks and transform processes in sectors like energy and manufacturing”. But all of these plans might be subject to revision, in one way or another, as the AI world takes stock of the potential impact of DeepSeek, an open-source, generative AI (GenAI) platform from China that appears to match the capabilities of existing GenAI apps, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT, while reportedly running on far more cost-effective compute infrastructure. The DeepSeek app was launched last week and is already top of the Apple App Store’s ranking of free apps, one ahead of ChatGPT. DeepSeek’s capabilities and its ability to match other apps while running on less advanced chips than its US rivals sent to stock markets into panic mode, reported Bloomberg, with Nvidia’s share price slumping by almost 13% to $124.47 in early trading on the Nasdaq exchange on Monday. As a result of that decline, Nvidia’s market value is only just above $3tn (so it’s not in any danger of collapse…). While the launch of new AI apps and models is only going to continue, and potentially cause ructions in the AI tech world, all of these developments spell good news for the telecom sector. All that data traffic needs to be shunted from A to B across data networks, and while the hyperscalers have some of their own network infrastructure, they, as well as the world’s enterprises, will need to rely on data network operators to underpin their operations, which is the exact point Verizon made when it launched its AI Connect strategy at the end of last week. Having recently reached a binding agreement to form a fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) joint venture, two of Spain’s main telcos, MásOrange and Vodafone Spain (now owned by Zegona Communications), are reportedly in talks to form a mobile network joint venture that would combine their radio access network assets, reports Expansion. Any resulting company would then seek to sell a stake to an external investor, which is the same model the operators are deploying with their FTTP venture. UK broadband network operator TalkTalk is investigating a potential data breach after a hacker offered access to the details of 19 million current and former customers, according to The Register. – The staff, TelecomTV Jan 28, 2025 Jan 28, 2025 Jan 28, 2025 Jan 27, 2025 Jan 24, 2025 Sign up to receive TelecomTV's top news and videos, plus exclusive subscriber-only content direct to your inbox.

One of the biggest tech companies you’ve never heard of is helping you listen to this podcast. by Nilay Patel One of the biggest tech companies you’ve never heard of is helping you listen to this podcast. by Nilay Patel Today, I’m talking with Gary Smith, CEO of the networking company Ciena. You probably aren’t familiar with Ciena — the company isn’t really a household name. But every internet user has relied on the company’s products; in fact, every internet user has used its products. Ciena makes the hardware and software that make the fiber optic cables that connect the world light up with data. That’s everything from local fiber networks for broadband ISPs to the massive undersea cables that connect continents. There’s a high probability that this very podcast came to you over a Ciena-powered network, in fact — this company is everywhere. Gary himself is a fascinating character in this story. He joined Ciena in 1997, the year the company had an astonishingly successful IPO in the middle of the dotcom boom. And he became its CEO in 2001, right after the dotcom crash sent the company’s stock price — and the rest of the economy — into a tailspin. So Gary has had a front-row seat to the development of the internet as we know it, and Ciena has been there every step of the way — as telecoms and undersea cables first brought the planet online, all the way to the rise of cloud computing and, now, generative AI. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! You’re going to hear Gary and I talk a lot about something called WDM, or Wavelength Division Multiplexing, which is the fundamental technical innovation Ciena is built around. WDM is absolutely key to how the modern internet works, and most people have no idea it exists. The basic idea is that WDM uses multiple wavelengths of light to fit more data onto a single fiber optic cable, which allows those cables to deliver more and more information over time — you’ll hear Gary call it “virtualizing” a fiber optic cable, like you’re turning a single cable into two, or five, or 10. This is obviously hugely important as the world’s internet usage increases and data-hungry applications like streaming video and generative AI ramp up. Ciena didn’t invent WDM, but it was the first company to deploy it commercially in the ’90s — and I wanted to know how Gary was managing his investment in pushing that technology forward and whether he was thinking about the next kind of tech that might disrupt it. I also wanted to know about Ciena’s customers. There are only so many companies building deep sea cables and giant data centers, and it won’t surprise you that the customer set has largely shifted from telecom providers and ISPs to giant cloud computing companies like Meta and Google and Microsoft over the past few years. Just a few months ago, Meta announced it would pay $10 billion to build its own exclusive subsea cable stretching nearly 25,000 miles. Ciena sits right in the middle of that complicated relationship between industry and infrastructure, and I think you’ll find Gary’s perspective to be pretty unique. We also got into the fracturing state of the internet and what it means that people in different geographic locations, dependent on various levels of government control, experience the online world differently. Connecting cables stretching across continents means the people on either end of those cables might have very different ideas about the internet, and Ciena has to take all of that into account. See, I’m guessing you didn’t know about Ciena before, but almost every single Decoder idea is right here, sitting on the backbone of the internet. Okay, Ciena CEO Gary Smith. Here we go. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Gary Smith, you’re the CEO of Ciena. Welcome to Decoder. Thank you. Good to be here. I am very excited to talk to you. The Decoder team and I were talking earlier about how we love stories of hidden companies that run the world, and Ciena very much feels like one of those companies. It is a huge player in networking. It’s a huge player in the future of our networks. There’s some AI to talk about. There’s undersea cables to talk about, which is always fun. Quickly, for everyone, describe what Ciena is and what you do. Basically, Ciena is the leading technology company in the world for providing high-speed connectivity. So if you think about all the networks that have been enabled around the internet and around the world, or, as you alluded to, submarine cables, Ciena is really the driving force behind that high-speed technology. Even with mobile connectivity, terrestrial connectivity, and submarine cable connectivity, we’re basically the best in the world at moving optical bits. I always think about it as two internets, right? There’s the internet we experience — the digital internet — and then there’s the physical internet: the actual cables and wires that connect our networks together and connect us together. That is Ciena’s business, running these cables, figuring out how to move data across them more quickly, and figuring out how to move more data across them. Ciena’s been around for a minute. How has the dynamic between what people are doing on the digital internet most consumers experience and what you need to do on the physical internet changed? It seems like something we don’t ever really get to talk about. I’m very curious to ask you about it. I think we consume most of the internet now in a mobile form, on our iPads, iPhones, or whatever. We still have some desktops, but it’s all laptops. The first point of connectivity there is mobile. It’s available to us all the time. But what we don’t think about is that it’s only mobile until it’s not. It needs to get terrestrialized to the nearest area where it comes down into terrestrial — typically fiber because to get really high speed, you need to use fiber. Wireless has some limitations around that. So basically, until it gets to any mobile application, its real objective is to get terrestrial into that cell tower as quickly as possible. Then, from the bottom of the cell tower is when all the magic starts, with the physical fiber cables and the networks that go around the world. If you have an inquiry, depending on what it is, that could require a different continent. That goes down through the cell tower and out across the sea and back to you. But that’s invisible to us all. We’re able to do it at such high speeds now that it’s transparent to the applications that you’re using. That’s the part I really want to dig into. Intellectually, I think I’ve always understood that. I think most people understand that there are servers and data centers elsewhere and we are communicating with them somehow. But at some point we need to hit a fiber line and actually talk to those servers. What I’m trying to understand is that there’s the consumer application layer of the internet — we’re all going to watch a bunch of Instagram reels or something. Then, there’s the internet we need to build to support that. What’s the relationship between those two? How often do you think, “I see the next set of applications that are coming on phones, I see the next set of devices that people may want to use. or I see the rise of streaming services. We better start building an internet that can support it?” That dynamic often seems subsumed in some cell carrier or data center conversations. It very rarely comes to the forefront. Because it’s the piece that connects all of this stuff. Everybody focuses on things like AI, Netflix, or whatever right now. How do you get those things to manifest themselves to the consumer and to enterprise? The reality is that it required a massive build-out over the last two decades for a fiber infrastructure that basically connects all these data centers together, that connects them through submarine cables, and connects them across countries. It has intelligence on it so it knows where to go to get that information. That has evolved over the last two decades. It continues to evolve because if you think about some of the business models that we now take for granted, like Uber, that wouldn’t be available if you couldn’t get instant response to it. Twenty years ago, that would not have been possible as a business model. There was an interesting point in the early 2000s where there was this massive overbuild of fiber capacity. It was sort of the telecom nuclear winter where we had more capacity than apparently we’d need for the next two decades. People built out all of these large fiber networks and no one came. But that enabled business models to take large amounts of bandwidth at low cost. That created business models like Amazon, which weren’t able to get stimulated and be sustainable until they had large amounts of dependable connectivity. So it’s constantly evolving with applications that are demanding much higher bandwidth. We’re in an era of that now with AI for sure. The networks have to catch up and facilitate that. Let me ask about the networks. Let’s say I want to build a network in some rural part of the country. Do I just call Ciena and say, “All right. We’re going to get to work. Go dig some trenches”? Do I run the network? Do you run the network? How does that work? We don’t run the network. Those are the service provider carriers. If you take North America as an example, there are hundreds of carriers that do the local last mile piece out in the rural areas. Then, there’s the Verizons, Comcasts, and AT&Ts of this world that then facilitate all of that connectivity to the consumer. We provide the technology that powers their networks basically. For them to get that high-speed connectivity, Ciena’s technology goes on the ends of those fiber cables that allows the speed and throughput to continue to drive the capacity. What we basically do is virtualize a single piece of fiber. So instead of having that little thread, which is about a hair thread in terms of weight and distance, we can multiply that many, many times. That’s hundreds of virtual fibers because of the technology we use around it. That’s enabled the whole scaling of the internet. It’s enabled the scaling of this global connectivity phenomenon that we have, and it’s at the center of scaling for AI connectivity now and into the future. That core piece of technology where you’re multiplexing and virtualizing the single piece of fiber, that was Ciena’s big technology bet. I believe it’s called WDM. Explain that to people very quickly. Basically, it’s virtualization. Where you’ve got one piece of fiber, [WDM] makes it look like multiple fibers. Depending on the distance and what you’re putting down, it can be hundreds of fibers, which is actually physically manifested as a single fiber. So you don’t need to put more fibers into the ground. With the technology we have on either end of it, you can just scale it up. So, it’s the virtualization of fiber that has enabled this almost seamless marriage between the applications, to your point, and the driving of all the network traffic with the actual network. Through our technology development, we’ve grown the ability to go do that faster than Moore’s Law. We now have a new piece of technology, called WaveLogic, that can do 1.6 terabits of data down a single piece of fiber. It’s always been explained to me that the fiber is the fiber, and we’re just sending light back and forth. It’s the pieces at the end that actually create the additional bandwidth to create that additional capability. Is that more or less true? Are you just focused on the bits at the end that talk to each other? Absolutely. There are technology developments within the fiber that assist that, for sure, and there’s been a lot of that development from companies like Corning in the fiber world. But basically, the magic is the technology that goes on the end of those fibers. When you think about it, if we had to scale by digging up the place every time we wanted to put more fibers in, it’s just not practical. We can get a tremendous amount of expansion and virtual capacity even on old fibers just by putting our technology on the end of it. You were talking about scaling faster than Moore’s Law, which is roughly a doubling every 18 months. Decoder listeners are very pedantic. They will tell me that’s not actually what Moore’s Law means, but I think that’s how you’re using it. I appreciate our listeners very much, but I don’t think that’s what applies here. You’re talking about a doubling of bandwidth every 18 months. Yes. You’ve been doing WDM since 1997, right? This is the technology bet of the company. Is it the capacity of WDM where you’re using multiple wavelengths of light across a single fiber? Is that what’s doubling? Yeah, it’s our ability to continue to drive that. When we first started, we could multiplex and keep it very simple. It was a single piece of fiber. We thought we could put four virtual fibers down there. That was revolutionary at the time. Many of the carriers we went to with that said, “Oh, that’s fantastic. We’ll never need more than that.” Then, we figured out how to do eight, then 16, then 32, then 64. And we’re way, way beyond that now. So what that means is you have that single piece of fiber that looks like 64 fibers. That’s enabled this massive scaling of architecture around the world. Then, we deploy that technology not just with local connectivity, but across the country and whole continents — 8,000, 10,000-mile submarine cables. We can support that kind of capacity across the submarine cables. Do you just sell these boxes to the telecom and data center providers and walk away? Do you have ongoing support? No, it’s a very integrated partnership. Most of the major carriers — I think 96 percent of the major carriers around the world — are Ciena customers. These are collaborations that we’ve worked on for multiple decades. We help manage the networks. We do a lot of the installation work for them. We do the planning. We have the software that actually manages the network and looks for predictive issues or challenges and switches automatically. If there are problems on certain fibers, it will detect that and switch it through. So, there’s a lot of underlying technology and collaboration between us and all the service providers. Also all of the hyperscalers. Pretty much all of the hyperscalers use Ciena to connect their data centers around the world. We partner with them as well on technology developments that are specific to their networks. You look at the hyperscalers, some of the largest networks in the world, and they’re very complicated, multi-continent, metro, long-haul, submarine cables. The biggest players and the biggest owners of capacity on submarine cables now are actually the cloud players. That used to be the traditional service providers, but now it’s the likes of Google and Meta that really own a lot of the global capacity on those submarine cables. This is the thing that I was talking about at the beginning. It seems so hard to understand, and it’s so interesting to talk to you about it because you’re in it. The internet we experience is obviously changing the dynamics of the internet we build. So. I experience my phone and there’s a bunch of stuff happening on some data center owned by Google, Microsoft, or whatever, and that means those companies now own most of the capacity of undersea cables. I don’t think that chain of events is intuitive unless you’re paying attention to it. But just talking to you for 13 minutes here, that seems very intuitive to you. It makes sense to you that they would have the capacity because I’m not sending nearly as much data as a consumer across the ocean. Do you see that changing? How fast has that grown? Describe that dynamic to me. Take the submarine cables as an example. It’s a good proxy for what’s happened here. From the 1980s to 2010, this was all funded by the service providers. It was a way of getting transatlantic phone conversations largely to Europe and a little bit to Asia. These companies, like British Telecom and AT&T, would have these cables, they would get together a consortium, and, as a syndicate, fund these submarine cables. With the advent of cloud, you had these players that wanted to have very high-speed connectivity. Take for example Meta, Google, Microsoft, or any of these players. If they were going to be in the European market, they needed to have very high speed, dedicated capacity. So in about 2010, you began to see the cloud players purchasing the capacity of those submarine cables. In the last five years or so, you’ve seen Google begin to own many of these cables, with Meta and others too. So, it evolved from, “Hey, it’s all this service provider and it’s just phone calls.” When you want to reach your aunt in Europe, in India, or whatever, then it’s just a phone call, which is a very small amount of data. The amount of data that’s now being required by these cloud players is multiple more times than that. You’ve got a lot of graphics going over it as well, which takes a lot of bandwidth. So the need for bandwidth has grown dramatically. It makes sense that the cloud players want to connect their data centers. If they’re putting a data center in India and want to connect it to North America, they want to own the connectivity for that, and it’s a much higher speed. So they’re not just buying the capacity. They’re actually taking control and owning the cables. So, there’s been sort of an evolution of that over the last five years. The first 10 years was, “Hey, we will take the capacity now.” Their networks are made up of a hybrid of owning the cable, owning some, or they rent it from the service providers. But you’ve now got, I think, 600-plus submarine cables around the world. You’ve got about 1.5 million kilometers of fiber at the bottom of the sea facilitating this, and the cloud players are really driving that marketplace now. That’s going to lead us into the inevitable conversation we’ll have about AI, but I just want to stay on this for one second. How has the verticalization, from “what we sell is virtualized compute capacity” down to “we will now own the cables in the ocean and verticalize our business and make sure we own it tip to tail,” changed your company? We’re looking at, “There’s WDM in 1997. This is the core innovation that lets us get more capacity out of the fiber networks. We’re initially going to sell that to telecom companies to do more phone calls or the early internet.” Now, multiple generations in, you’re selling it directly to Google to connect data centers so that it might run AI workloads.” It feels like that would have some pressure on your roadmaps and your go-to-market. How is that expressed? The evolution has been such that the first appreciators for that technology were obviously the service providers. As the internet began to gain traction in 2003, 2004, you began to see the cloud players get more interested in the network because if they’re going to monetize and get to the eyeballs that they wanted, the network actually becomes important to them. So, there’s been a steady increase in appreciation of that even prior to the AI piece, and they’ve become much more active. I mean, we really didn’t sell to the cloud players until about 10 years ago, and we had zero market share there. Now, we’ve got the main market share with a leading player in connecting data centers and cloud players around the world. Submarine cables are the same kind of thing. We really didn’t focus on the submarine cables with our technology because there wasn’t that much capacity being required. We’ve now got number one share in submarine cable connectivity around the world because they value very high-speed capacity. So the cloud players have gone from being a very small percentage of our business to over 50 percent of our business now being, directly or indirectly, cloud and hyperscalers. So it’s a very significant shift in the business, and that’s really accelerated in the last five years. I think this is a great time to ask the classic Decoder questions. You’re describing a shift in the business and a shift in your customers. How is Ciena organized now? What does that org chart look like? It’s been easier for us in some ways because we’ve always been the leading technology company, so it’s really about who appreciates that technology and collaborates. This shift to the submarine markets and to cloud players has generally been a good fit for Ciena because we move very quickly, and we’re at cutting-edge technology. The latest technology we have is actually on three-nanometer chips. We were the first company in the world to have a 3nm chip actually be used in the telecom space, and we’re now actually working on our second. We’ve got that out, it’s carrying traffic around the world, and we’re working on our second version of that. We’ve always been at the leading edge of technology, and it really is a natural fit with these cloud players. So, we’re organized very simply. We have a large-service provider team around the world, a dedicated team for the hyperscalers and cloud, and an engineering team that works with them on co-development and stuff with that kind of technology. I’m a great believer in simplicity of organizational design. So, we have a very simple organizational structure that’s evolved to address that. That’s how we’re able to scale as quickly as we have. You’ve got the two big markets — the telecoms and the hyperscalers — and you have the engineering organization. I’m assuming the telecoms and the cloud providers want different things. How is that expressed in what the engineering organization goes off and builds? It’s interesting. There’s a lot of commonality about what they want. If you think about it from an engineering point of view and the latest WaveLogic technology we just developed, we actually take that same technology and we deploy it in slightly different variants to both markets. So, we get a better scale of development over that. Obviously, we develop a single chip and then do variants of it for specific applications that they want, but that same technology is essentially consumed across the service provider world because they all want the same thing: better economics across the fiber that they’ve got and increased bandwidth. The particular sensitivity, I would say — what’s really the difference between the two markets — is the cloud players are much more focused on power, which we all hear about from a data center point of view. It manifests itself exactly the same way in the telecom networks. We do variants that are power optimized for the cloud players, but that’s the predominant difference. That’s just taking the same core technology and doing a different variant of it that’s prioritized around power. That enables us to scale the development and the rest of it. So, we have a single global engineering team focused on this core technology. Ciena has always been a very focused player. We’ve been very focused on just high-speed connectivity. This has enabled us when most of our competitors are trying to do mobile or other kinds of things. For the past three decades, we just wanted to be the best in the world at moving optical bits at a high speed. The opportunity we have now is increasingly into the campus and potentially even inside the data center with that same core technology, and that’s all in front of us. We get zero revenue from there right now. But it’s the same customers, so that’s an exciting opportunity for us in the future. I want to talk about that a little bit more, but can I just ask one more question? You said power. That suggests to me that you’re building a data center, you have an energy budget, and then you hold all the vendors to some number on the line to make sure you hit your energy budget. You’re feeling that too, even as the person is like, “Here’s the box that connects to the fiber line.” Yes. It manifests itself differently obviously, but everybody talks about the data centers and the power and the rest of it. Everybody is very focused on that for obvious reasons. But that same issue deploys when they come out onto the network too. You put amplifiers on the fiber to do that, and around these amplification sites, they want super low power because they are constrained around power and space. I’m assuming they would rather spend their power budget on running the GPUs as hot as they can. Exactly. They don’t want to spend it on the communications part, or they want to spend as little as possible on that. They want it optimized. We’re able to do that for them in terms of the footprint of the technology. We can now get down on a single plug what used to be a rack of cords. Quite literally, a six-foot-wide rack on a single plug, that same capacity. That’s what we’ve evolved over the last two decades with. So, we’re well placed with these guys to continue to drive down the power usage on the network, not just in the data center. How big is Ciena? How many people are on all of these various teams? We’re close to about 10,000 people worldwide. We’re very distributed. This year’s consensus revenue is about $4.4 billion, something like that. We’re profitable, and we have a strong balance sheet. We very much invest directly into this technology. Because we’ve been such a focused player at it, we felt that this high-speed connectivity would be appreciated eventually, and it’s really coming into its own now. You have to make these investments for the long term. Some of our technologies take five-plus years to evolve. We’re fortunate in this time right now. It’s a good intersection point where high-speed technology is super appreciated. Is that an even split? Is it 3,300 in engineering, 3,300 in hyperscaler sales- No, it’s basically predominantly engineering. As you can imagine, this kind of technology is more about engineering, so more than half of our team are engineering talent. We’ve got applications engineers at the front end who help make sure we understand the applications and work with the customers on that, but more than half is engineering. As I said to you earlier on, it’s a very simple structure. One of the things that really strikes me is there is this core enabling invention, WDM. The company is built around it. Ciena’s made a few acquisitions over the years. You’ve led a few of them. There was one in 2019 for Centina Systems. Is WDM still the heart of it? Is that proprietary Ciena we’re building around it? Is there a next way to use fiber that’s coming? No, it’s basically the journey that we’re on. We’ve made multiple acquisitions, but it’s all been about the core mission, which is high-speed connectivity and the things we need around that. A lot of the acquisitions have been around vertical integration of that, so we have more control over it. It’s not just the core technology. It’s the things around it that you need to do. Most of those surrounding technologies were where we could focus and provide competitive advantage by doing something to them. Over the years, we’ve worked very carefully at acquisitions and organic developments that make us vertically integrated so we can control that. There’s advantages to control and scale, but what really drove us was that we think we can put competitive advantages in each of the technologies that we gather around the core technology, if that makes sense. The reason I’m asking that is because often you might want to buy a company that’s early to the next turn, but it seems like WDM is still the heart of what you’re doing, and you don’t see a finish line there. Basically, it’s this technology. The actual variant that we focus on is the coherent technology, and that’s what has enabled this DWDM to scale so much. But there are other technologies around it that we’ve developed, like the SerDes — the Serializer / Deserializer — and the kinds of things that are for analog conversion, which is incredibly difficult to do. We’ve got some of the best technology in the world around that. It’s the moat that you put around that, but it’s not the next thing. We think there’s a lot of headroom, particularly because this technology is all deployed right now. Think about it outside the data center. So as soon as it wants to present outside the data center, that’s Ciena. The opportunities we have with the same kinds of technology are now becoming apparent inside the campus — these campuses are getting super big now — and eventually will be inside the data center. That’s because the GPU and compute investment that’s going on requires higher and higher speed over longer and longer distances, even in some of these data centers. First of all, they’re enormous. You’ve got fiber going around them, sometimes multiple kilometers within a single data center with that fiber getting wrapped around. We think there’s an intersection point for our technology there. The technology there right now, which is just called direct-connect, is required to connect all of the racks within the data center and the intra-data center. The physics of that is getting challenged as these GPUs require higher and higher speed. So, we think there’s a real opportunity for us to intersect that, to your point, with the same kind of core technology that requires some variations over the next 1–3 years. Let me ask you the classic Decoder question, and then I want to get into that. You’ve been at Ciena for a long time. I think you’ve been there for 30 years. You’ve been the CEO for almost 25 now. How do you make decisions? What’s your framework? Depends on what kind of decision it is, right? Not all decisions are equal. I very much feel that it’s a team game. When we make strategic decisions — which I think is what you’re alluding to with how we invest and what long-term things we’re focused on — we’re strategically aligned around what we want to go do. We’re a very focused company. Back to the point I was making earlier, I think people appreciate the best of breed, and we want to be the best in the world at what we do. The north star is very clear to us. Then, it’s about what things we need to do to get out into the future on that. From that point of view, the decision making is somewhat easier because we know we’ve chopped the field, so we know where we’re playing on. There’s not some great conversation about adjacencies and things that we might want to get into; it’s all based on our core technology. To answer your question, if it’s something strategic around those investments, it’s always a team game. We’re super collaborative. It’s how we work and get cross-functional input into all of those things. So, it’s a process. But I would say that I think the role of a CEO sometimes is to say, “Okay. We’ve had the debate. This is the overall perspective of what we want to do. Let’s go.” I think part of the role of the CEO is to facilitate the best conversations and discussions and then help drive to a conclusion. Let me give you a hypothetical that I suspect you will shrug off, but I’m going to try anyway. You’re looking at two big groups of clients. You’ve got your telecom companies, and you’ve got your big cloud providers who are all racing into AI. You have some opportunity to grow that business by going into the data centers, not just landing the fiber at the doorstep. That seems like the much richer opportunity. I look at the state of the telecoms in the United States, for example. They’re not growing much, right? They’re churning customers between them. It would seem very obvious that your entire team would say, “Don’t worry about them so much. We need to put all of our focus on the AI providers because that is where there’s growth using our same core technology.” But then you still have to service the telecom customers, I imagine. How do you balance that out? How do you make that decision to say, “These investments are going to go over here?” It’s actually much easier for us because, back to the point I was making, it’s the same kind of core technology. When we move the ball down the field for the cloud players, we can apply that to the service provider space because it’s the same core technology. In terms of their needs, there are actually a lot of similarities. Another way of thinking about this is when we start talking about the data center and the rest of it, we provide optical systems where we do the whole thing for the service providers. And we do that pretty much for the cloud players too. So we do all of the systems for the software, what we call the WDM modem technology, and the line systems. We do all of that, and often we’ll install it, support it, and maintain it. We do that for service providers and we do that for the cloud players. Then, to the point around the opportunity in the data center, it’s not necessarily about providing those complete systems. It’s taking them, putting them in plugs, and then putting them in components. So it’s a different kind of play, but it’s still the core technology. So, anything you do to advance that also applies to our systems business, and our systems business is both service provider and in the cloud. You don’t have to make the “which are your favorite children?” kind of choice, which is where you were going with that. I think that’s another benefit of a company staying super focused on its core technology and understanding what value we bring to the world. That is very difficult for anybody else to replicate, Well, can I ask you about that? Because it feels like the Trump administration is incoming. By the time people listen to this, he will have been inaugurated and we’ll be off to the races with a new kind of business climate here in the United States. Mergers will be in fashion again. They have not been in fashion over the past four years. If I was running Google or Microsoft, I would say, “Well, this is the core technology that’s going to make my data center more efficient and move data faster on my cable. I’m just going to buy this company.” Have you been approached to be acquired? Well, I’m not going to– I’m just wondering because I can see why over the past several years, all of that conversation has chilled. But it’s also remarkable to me that a company like Ciena has remained independent for 30 years. That used to be the conversation all the time. Think about 20 years ago. I’m not sure some of your viewers will remember some of these names: Lucent, Alcatel, Nortel, even Nokia. The model was all what I call the “generalist model.” They were actually spin outs from their phone companies like Marconi. Northern Telecom came out of Canada. So with the model, we had to be end to end. You had to put switches, routers, handsets, mobile infrastructure, and this thing called transport. We said when we started, “No, we’re going to just focus on the transport piece because we think it can get to scale.” What’s happened over the last two decades is that the generalists, because they couldn’t afford to be at the cutting edge in each of those areas, have all struggled. You trace the genesis of all of those companies now and basically they’re all in Nokia. With Alcatel and Lucent and all the rest of them, the music stopped and that’s where they ended up. The point I’m making about that is the world’s too competitive now for the whole end-to-end thing and being a generalist supplier. It just absolutely is. They used to say to us, “Well, when are you going to get bought?” We used to say, “Listen, we’re a public company. We have all the fiduciary responsibilities that you would expect with a public company, but we think we can get to scale and be a real company just doing what we’re doing.” Now, these things take a while and we’ve been public for 25 years, but we’re at a point now where we absolutely have scale. We’re very strong financially. We can invest in this kind of technology. We’ve got the number one market share in all the key markets that we want to play in. So, we’ve got a good opportunity to drive shareholder value from here. Do you think that DWDM, the multiplexing you do to virtualize the fiber, is enough of a moat? You were describing the other acquisitions you’ve made and how you surround the core technology with other things to enter different markets as the moat. But is that core technology something that… I don’t know if Mark Zuckerberg woke up one morning and was like, “screw it, I’m open sourcing it,” he could just do it? Or is that more specialized? There are other companies that have variants of this technology, for sure. It’s just that we’re able to implement it faster and quicker and better than anybody else, and we have the core competencies around it. A bit of an analogy is TSMC. People kind of know how to do [what TSMC does], but they can’t do it, right? You can go to ASML and ask for a machine and that’s not where it stops. Yeah. Because it’s people, and it’s the folks that understand that it’s the five, 10 percent of each of these areas that really make the difference to things when you put it and all the things we’ve built around it all together. So like with any of these things, it’s a confluence that makes up the competitive advantage. It’s when you get down to the real technologies. It’s all of those things that provide the moat for us. It’s the fact that we’re focused and the fact that we’re now so embedded with these key cloud and technology companies and were part of the collaboration process around the evolution of their networks. It’s the relationships that you build up, that trusted relationship and the technology collaboration over time. That’s why we think we’ve got an opportunity to take that into a whole new market for us with the campus and eventually inside the data center. I want to talk about two things that seem like they’re going to happen to the hyperscalers, in particular, over the next four, 10 years. One of them has a lot to do with subsea cables and the other one is obviously AI. Let’s start with subsea cables. If I look broadly at our nation’s big companies — Amazon, Google, Meta, Apple — they’re about to enter into a world where an emboldened Donald Trump wants to just reset the international order. They own cables that connect our continents together. There’s a lot of people who want to break the internet apart in different ways. We might ban TikTok. We might not ban TikTok. China doesn’t allow our apps there. There’s a lot of interest in what is happening on our networks that connect our countries together and who gets what where. Then there’s just the reality that they are wires in the ground. Bad things happen to them. They get cut. There are wars. How much of that do you engage with personally? How much do you think about, “Okay. There are some fraught geopolitics that are about to change. I need to make some decisions to get ahead of it, be aware of it, insulate myself against it, or insulate Ciena against it?” How much of your time do you spend on that? I mean, there are the headings of things you can control and then things that you can’t control but need to be mindful of, right? It’s definitely in that second list. I could argue that over the last five or 10 years we’ve had quite a lot of geopolitical dynamics going on. We are mindful of that, particularly because we operate in multiple countries, so 80 countries around the world. Our technology is widely deployed. We are mindful of those kinds of dynamics, and I’ll give you an example. We made a decision in the early 2000s that we would not go in and be a provider to the Chinese market for its major service providers. There was a whole set of thought processes that went into that. One of our competitors at the time was Huawei and it was just emerging. I don’t think people appreciate this, but the first real iteration of technology that Huawei came out with was actually in our space, so way before all the mobile stuff and all the other omnipotent things that it’s now doing. So around 2003 we said, “What’s this company, what are they doing, and how is it achieving price points that are just lower than our cost?” Turns out that we’re being subsidized by the Chinese government, right? It’s like we’ve seen this movie several times since 2003. So one of the thought processes that we had, just to give you an illustration , we said, “You know what? We will not compete with it directly in the China market. It obviously wants us there because we’ve got leading technology and the rest of it. We’re actually not going to manufacture in China either. So we’re going to be the antithesis, if you like, of Huawei in every single way. We’re going to be the alternative that’s not a Chinese manufacturer, and we won’t operate there.” That was a very controversial thing. You imagine a young company that’s just gone public and going, “Hang on a minute, why are you not going into the largest market and fastest growing telecom market in the world?” But we had the strength of our convictions. It’s taken a while, but I think largely that was a good decision for us because we didn’t get distracted by that Chinese market. They’ll give you 10 percent of that market, but they’ll make sure you won’t get anything else, and you’ll partner with a local partner. I spent a lot of time in Asia. I lived in Asia for a number of years before I came to Ciena. And I saw that movie, to your point, play out in so many different ways. I was super sensitive to that, as was the team. So, that is an instance of us doing something because of the geopolitical dynamics at the time and us making a decision. You don’t know how that’s going to play out because things can change., You’ve just got to be smart around what you think is the best thing for the shareholders and your company and stick to it. Do you mostly follow the lead of the clients? Do you have your own points of view on geopolitics? I’m thinking of things like when you land the cable in Europe and your devices there decoding all the traffic that there are a number of European spy agencies that might want to sit right next to that. The NSA in our country would love to sit right next to that. When you land in other countries that have different kinds of privacy and security concerns, they might want to be a part of that. Is that something where you say, “Look, Meta owns this cable. You talk to Meta. We’re going to do what the client says,” or is that, “We are simply not going to build these cables in certain devices”? We’re actually pretty fortunate that we don’t have to make some of those tough decisions because it’s not our cable. So to your point — But the data going over the cable, that’s you, right? You’re encoding and decoding it? Yeah, that’s what we’re doing, but even that technology is owned by the customer. We sold that to the customer, and what they do with it is entirely up to them. We don’t have control over that. It’s their network.. It’s their property. You think about these submarine cables. Someone owns the cable, and we put the technology on the end of it. It’s their technology. They own that, and they run it as well. We don’t run it. So they run those networks. We’re fortunate in that we’ve always been able to stay one step behind some of those dilemma questions. It’s not something we have to opine on. When you think about the actual cables, they’re in international waters. What’s the longest one that you operate? I think it’s about 10,000 kilometers. Some of these cables are around the Pacific where you get the big distances, so they are very, very long cables. A lot of them stop off on different islands and places and spur off. Some of the new cables going in are spurring off in different places. We’ve also developed a technology that overlays that provides for resilience. So if you get a cut on a particular cable, then we can reroute it depending on the architecture. It’s called GeoMesh. It’s software and technology that’s embedded into our core offerings and enables us to provide resilience across some of those submarine cable links. In the normal run of things, you get I think something like 100-plus faults a year, mainly trawlers dragging their anchors on a fiber cable because they’re buried at the bottom of the sea until they’re not. I mean, they’ve got to come up somewhere. Typically, it’s in the shallower waters where you’ll get some fishing vessel come across it. Do you ever get angry sharks? Do you ever get a text message like “shark attack brought down the network?” Actually, that’s a common question I get asked around it. There is a section around fish attacks. I think it’s zero. I’m sure there are some examples of it that someone can point to over the last three decades, but I’ve never heard of it personally. I think they’ve got other things to worry about than these little tiny... it’s about the size of a big hosepipe, so I don’t think it’d be particularly interesting to them. We have this phrase that we’ve been using at The Verge, my friend Casey Newton came up with it ages ago. He calls it the “Splinternet,” where we perceive one cohesive internet, but really we’re fracturing. We’re fracturing into continent-specific, country-specific internets. As I talked to you about the cloud providers, it’s very obvious to me that we now have a number of private internets operating at high speed around the world that are just owned and controlled by single companies. You have a long view of the internet. You are one of the few guests on Decoder who’s ever just straight up talked about Alcatel. You have a long view of the internet, how we’ve grown it, and what it’s for. The telecoms, by and large, were national champions, right? That’s how they have thought about themselves. Even in the United States, that’s how they’ve thought about themselves. That’s where they came from. There’s a new kind of nationalism in America around our tech giants in the Trump administration. Mark Zuckerberg says, “I want the Trump administration to go fight the European regulators on my behalf.” That’s new, it hasn’t come up before. We’ll see if this jacket fits. He’s trying it on. But the way we build networks is an expression of national capability. We haven’t experienced that too much as the internet. It’s been one global internet that connects all, and then we do whatever we want and set our borders. But we haven’t actually split the networks apart. But now you’ve got big cloud provider private networks. You do have rising nationalism around the world. You just have a pulling apart of the internet. Is that affecting how you are building networks or how your clients are asking you to build networks? I totally understand the notion, and I think what you’ve got is that a disproportionate amount — this is sort of an English understatement — of the innovation and development for all of this has been done in the US, amongst all these technology companies, for sure. Now, the big cloud players are investing in that network because that’s their business model, and the network is becoming more and more important. When we talk about the network, to your point, we talk about it in this homogeneous form. But if you think about this in the context of some of the large markets that the US cloud players are trying to get into… take places like India. When they enter the Indian market, they are dependent upon connectivity from the local carriers. So they can tip up with the submarine cables and the landing stations, but then it’s, “How do I get connected to all the people I need to get connected to in India enterprise and consumer?” They are then dependent on the local carriers, be it Bharti, Jio, Vodafone Idea, some of the wholesale carriers that are also there, and fiber. There’s always going to be an interrelationship because as omnipotent as all of these cloud players are, they’re not going to be able to connect to everybody’s home across the planet. So you’ve always got this interplay between service providers and the cloud players. What often happens there is that in some of these countries, the service provider will provide a specific network for the cloud player, and they call it a Managed Optical Fiber Network, or MOFN. And we help facilitate that. It’s our technology, so it matches all of their global networks. But it’s owned and operated by the local service provider to support Meta, Google, Microsoft, etc. Increasingly, I’d argue you’re seeing that interdependency work. So, I wouldn’t say it’s the counter-argument to the idea that we’re all splitting up because at the end of the day, to get to the consumers around the world, these service providers are not going away in that regard. That’s not going to change. They are the only ones that can provide that connectivity ultimately, be it the enterprise or the consumer. I’m fascinated by this because it does seem like the overall geopolitical dynamics of the world are changing, and the internet will change with it. I just keep coming back to the question I started with, which is about how the experience we have on the digital internet obviously impacts the physical internet that you are responsible for building. I’m always trying to find the touchpoints between the two. The way we architect networks in India has a direct relationship to the Indian internet that those users experience, and it seems like those things are, if not diverging completely between different countries, certainly beginning down different paths. That, to me, seems utterly fascinating. I want to end with AI here. As you think about entering their data centers and saying, “We can envision some new high bandwidth, high capacity workloads in these data centers,” which for the past 15 years we have not really come up with massive new ones outside of streaming video. Streaming video is a lot, but that’s basically what we came up with. Now there’s some new ones in AI that might hit all kinds of new industries. Do you think that that is just an exponential rise in how much capacity we need, how much power we’ll need to use, how much networking capacity that we’ll sustain? Or is it, to make the comparison earlier to dark fiber, building out a lot of capacity that we’ll eventually use over time? That’s a great question. Having lived through the previous period of the telecom nuclear winter where we built out all this capacity — and as it turned out, no one came — it did facilitate all these business models that wouldn’t have accelerated without that glut of capacity. I get asked the question if we’re in another bubble around all of these data centers. Specifically around the data center piece, I think there’s an insatiable demand for compute, to build out compute power. These things always take longer than we all think to monetize and the rest of it, so we’re probably going to go through some iterations. But to answer your real question, I’m actually of the opposite view this time round. I think we’re underestimating the amount of traffic and bandwidth that will be required to go do this because we’re already seeing a clip up in cloud traffic. We’re pretty well placed to see that. Now, how much of that could I attribute to AI? Some of it is, but I’ve got no way of really discerning which bit is which, and it’s not our network. But there’s a definite uptick in cloud traffic just to connect to all of these data centers. We are absolutely seeing that, and I think that’s going to continue because you’ve got a lot more data centers coming online in the next 18 months, or two years around the world. If they’re going to monetize any of that, they’ve got to all be connected for learning, training, and the rest of it. That’s before you even see the applications for medical use or verticalization, whatever you want to call it. Using your ChatGPTs is generating traffic, sure. But then you start to get to any of that medical usage, for example, and the amount of graphics that are required. Graphics are about 10–20 times more bandwidth-consuming than normal data. So, if you start to get to the monetization of that through these vertical applications, I think we’re underestimating the amount of traffic that’s going to be there. When you plan out growth for the company — obviously, you’re a public company, so you have to do it out in front of everyone and talk about risk — in your most optimistic view, is it sustainable, the rate of demand that you see now? You’re saying we’re underestimating it. I look at it maybe a bit more cynically, which is, “Wow, we are building a lot of capacity against business models that don’t exist.” OpenAI has yet to turn $1 in profit, and it wants all of the power that the world can generate. It wants every GPU that Nvidia can build. That’s a lot, right? There’s an inherent promise there that this will all pay off. Maybe you would call that a bubble or maybe you won’t. I’m just looking at it more mathematically. A lot of companies are going to sell a lot of things to these data centers. We’re going to build a lot of capacity, and maybe at some point we will have built enough or not enough or something will happen, but that will come to an end. Then a company like yours is saying, “Well, we’ve had this rate of growth and now maybe it’s plateaued or maybe it’s going down.” How are you thinking about that? I think about it like this: Don’t confuse compute capacity with the network. The network is always the afterthought to all of this, right? It’s, “Oh my gosh, I do actually need to connect these data centers.” So what’s the hierarchy of their thought process? It’s, “I need the compute. I need the power. I need the space.” Those are the things that are driving their decision. Then by the way, “Oh my gosh, I need to connect these data centers right now.” I’m being flippant, but it is down there. I’d like to tell you it was right up there, but it isn’t. In the answer to this question, I think that’s actually a good thing. We only get there when they need it. They’re not building out these enormous capacities because we see it. We’re putting capacity out there, and they’re putting traffic down it. So I take real comfort from that, having lived through 2002 and 2003 when our revenues went down from something like $1.6 billion to about $300 million in one year. I’ve still got the scars from that, so I’m particularly sensitive to this. This is not the same dynamic. They are actually putting capacity out, and as fast as we put it out there, traffic is coming through it. To your point and to what a lot of other folks are saying, is it going to get overheated in terms of the GPU stuff and the data centers and the rest of it? In my personal opinion? Absolutely. Will there be a bit of a tail off in all of that? Absolutely. Will it take longer for applications in the AI world to truly generate the economics? Absolutely. But we’re not banking on that. We’re just seeing this nice steady growth in bandwidth, which I think will pervade throughout. Here’s another way of answering your question. Over the last two decades, bandwidth has grown about 20, 30 percent a year and is not cyclical. When you think about it, it shouldn’t be cyclical, should it? We’re just putting more and more applications out, we’re using our phones for more stuff, more people are getting phones, and all these devices are now connected. That has been very steady and consistent throughout. Even when you get an economic downturn, it continues at about that pace. What we’re talking about here is the advent of AI on top of that. Exactly what is it going to be? No one really knows. There’s all these models, but no one really knows. But it’s reasonable to assume that it’s going to come on top of that and could push us to 30, 40 percent bandwidth growth per year, and I think that’s going to be pretty sustainable. When you think about all the promise of AI, the real trick to it is you start putting any graphics down it. Every time you hear [Google CEO] Sundar Pichai say multi-modal AI, I can see the dollar signs floating through the offices over there. I love it. We’re basically planning our business on what we see, and we’ve taken our growth rates up. Typically, this business has grown. We’ve grown about 7 or 8 percent. We’re now saying it’s going to grow 8 to 11 percent over the next three years, and that’s without any massive entry into the data center space or anything else. It’s just what we see from a cloud growth point of view. You’ve talked a lot about entering the data center using the same core technology that you use for the undersea cables and the telecom providers. What are the barriers to doing that and what were the things you assessed when you thought, “Okay. This is the market we have to address”? The barriers to entry there are that you’ve got a technology called direct-connect, which has been well ensconced there really since the start of communication in data centers. You’ve got an ecosystem there that is going to be designed to elongate that for as long as possible, and the customers want to keep it for as long as possible. With the analytics we’ve done on it and working with them, they think that there’s going to be an intersection point where the physics of that gets to the point where it’s not sustainable. We think we’ve got to the point with power and space where there’s a good intersection. So it’s the analytics around that and working with two or three of these players who are already our customers but outside the data center. Is that them coming to you or are you going to them? A little bit of both. We have strong relationships with them, so that collaboration has been there. We’re realistic about it. The existing way of working and that direct-connect? That’s not going away. That’s probably still the majority of applications for it. So you’re looking at what the subset of corner-case applications are for this kind of high-speed connectivity. But even a small part of that is massive for us and massive from a scale point of view given the amount of spend that’s gone on in that space. It’s always about taking risks when that market isn’t there right now, but if you wait until that market appears, it’s too late. If you’re waiting for, “Oh, what’s the market share of this and what’s the growth rate?” At the end of the day, you’ve just got to go with what your intuition is and what you’re hearing and seeing from the customers and the rest. So we’ve got our first iteration of technology for this coming out at the end of the year. That’s a bet that we placed two, three years ago. As you know, the timing takes a while with some of these chip designs and stuff. You have to guess where the market’s going to go, not where it is right now. There’s always an element of risk to it. Listen, having gone through some of this before, you’re never going to get it completely right. You just have to be in the right vector, pay attention, and tweak along the way around it. So we’re listening intently. Gary, this was an incredible conversation. You’re going to have to come back sometime. I could talk to you about this for hours and hours. Love to. I enjoyed it, Nilay. Good questions. Good stuff. We’ll see. We should have you back a couple of years from now and see how stressed you are about these undersea cables. I think that would be very interesting. We’re certainly in for some entertainment, aren’t we? I know what we’re writing about for the next four years. Gary, this is amazing. Thank you so much.

Title: 'AI's Sputnik moment': China-based DeepSeek's open-source models may be a real threat to the dominance of OpenAI, Meta, and Nvidia

Some serious competition, at the very least. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. US-based companies have been at the forefront of the AI revolution, but now it looks like a new challenger has emerged. China-based DeepSeek is just over a year old, but the startup has released an open-source AI model called R1 that seems to have the rest of the industry worried. DeepSeek was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, the co-founder of High Flyer, an AI-driven hedge-fund (via Bloomberg). Despite being a mere fledgling in the AI world compared to some of the bigger names like OpenAI and Meta, the DeepSeek V3 family of AI models appear to be much more efficient than competitors' efforts like ChatGPT. Now R1, a new reasoning model fine-tuned from V3 training, also appears to be comparable in performance and accuracy to OpenAI's efforts. The Register has performed some early testing on R1 in comparison to OpenAI's o1, a similar "Chain of Thought" (CoT) model, and found that its capabilities seem remarkably similar—with the former even beating out the OpenAI model in the MATH-500 test. All while costing much less to train, with a Chiphell forum user claiming that "DeepSeek-R1 is priced at only about 3.65% of OpenAI o1" per million outputs. That's potentially bad news for Nvidia, which has been raking in cash as a result of high sales of its AI accelerator hardware to run the latest models at scale, taking the company's valuation up to the highest by market cap in the world at time of writing. According to some analysts, Nvidia's stock price is on track to shed nearly $400 billion dollars in the wake of R1's launch, although it appears to be holding relatively steady after a slump in early Monday trading. Dutch chip-maker ASML has seen its share price fall by more than 10% since R1's launch, while Siemens Energy dropped by 21%. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. US venture capitalist and advisor to Donald Trump, Marc Andreessen, made the comparison of R1's launch to the US and USSR space race, calling it "AI's Sputnik moment." Sputnik was a satellite launched by the USSR in 1957, and is widely thought to have wrongfooted the US government on the Soviet Union's space capabilities, leading to a space race between the two nations. What is artificial general intelligence?: We dive into the lingo of AI and what the terms actually mean. The elephant in the room, however, is trade sanctions. The US government has banned the export of high-end AI hardware to China, which some have speculated has led to a more efficient approach resulting in DeepSeek's new models. If so, that would suggest that the sanctions haven't had the effect that the US gov may have hoped. However, being a Chinese product (and given that many of the leading AI companies are US-based), it seems possible that restrictions may follow on its use for US companies, and potentially even those using US equipment, in the same fashion as the current trade sanctions. Either way, the release of DeepSeek-R1 appears to have caused a significant rumble in the AI markets. Whatever happens next, it seems that the US may no longer hold all the keys to advanced AI—and the world awaits it's response.

Title: DeepSeek FAQ

Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Latest Podcast Listen to Podcast Listen to this post: It’s Monday, January 27. Why haven’t you written about DeepSeek yet? I did! I wrote about R1 last Tuesday. I totally forgot about that. I take responsibility. I stand by the post, including the two biggest takeaways that I highlighted (emergent chain-of-thought via pure reinforcement learning, and the power of distillation), and I mentioned the low cost (which I expanded on in Sharp Tech) and chip ban implications, but those observations were too localized to the current state of the art in AI. What I totally failed to anticipate were the broader implications this news would have to the overall meta-discussion, particularly in terms of the U.S. and China. Is there precedent for such a miss? There is. In September 2023 Huawei announced the Mate 60 Pro with a SMIC-manufactured 7nm chip. The existence of this chip wasn’t a surprise for those paying close attention: SMIC had made a 7nm chip a year earlier (the existence of which I had noted even earlier than that), and TSMC had shipped 7nm chips in volume using nothing but DUV lithography (later iterations of 7nm were the first to use EUV). Intel had also made 10nm (TSMC 7nm equivalent) chips years earlier using nothing but DUV, but couldn’t do so with profitable yields; the idea that SMIC could ship 7nm chips using their existing equipment, particularly if they didn’t care about yields, wasn’t remotely surprising — to me, anyways. What I totally failed to anticipate was the overwrought reaction in Washington D.C. The dramatic expansion in the chip ban that culminated in the Biden administration transforming chip sales to a permission-based structure was downstream from people not understanding the intricacies of chip production, and being totally blindsided by the Huawei Mate 60 Pro. I get the sense that something similar has happened over the last 72 hours: the details of what DeepSeek has accomplished — and what they have not — are less important than the reaction and what that reaction says about people’s pre-existing assumptions. So what did DeepSeek announce? The most proximate announcement to this weekend’s meltdown was R1, a reasoning model that is similar to OpenAI’s o1. However, many of the revelations that contributed to the meltdown — including DeepSeek’s training costs — actually accompanied the V3 announcement over Christmas. Moreover, many of the breakthroughs that undergirded V3 were actually revealed with the release of the V2 model last January. Is this model naming convention the greatest crime that OpenAI has committed? Second greatest; we’ll get to the greatest momentarily. Let’s work backwards: what was the V2 model, and why was it important? The DeepSeek-V2 model introduced two important breakthroughs: DeepSeekMoE and DeepSeekMLA. The “MoE” in DeepSeekMoE refers to “mixture of experts”. Some models, like GPT-3.5, activate the entire model during both training and inference; it turns out, however, that not every part of the model is necessary for the topic at hand. MoE splits the model into multiple “experts” and only activates the ones that are necessary; GPT-4 was a MoE model that was believed to have 16 experts with approximately 110 billion parameters each. DeepSeekMoE, as implemented in V2, introduced important innovations on this concept, including differentiating between more finely-grained specialized experts, and shared experts with more generalized capabilities. Critically, DeepSeekMoE also introduced new approaches to load-balancing and routing during training; traditionally MoE increased communications overhead in training in exchange for efficient inference, but DeepSeek’s approach made training more efficient as well. DeepSeekMLA was an even bigger breakthrough. One of the biggest limitations on inference is the sheer amount of memory required: you both need to load the model into memory and also load the entire context window. Context windows are particularly expensive in terms of memory, as every token requires both a key and corresponding value; DeepSeekMLA, or multi-head latent attention, makes it possible to compress the key-value store, dramatically decreasing memory usage during inference. I’m not sure I understood any of that. The key implications of these breakthroughs — and the part you need to understand — only became apparent with V3, which added a new approach to load balancing (further reducing communications overhead) and multi-token prediction in training (further densifying each training step, again reducing overhead): V3 was shockingly cheap to train. DeepSeek claimed the model training took 2,788 thousand H800 GPU hours, which, at a cost of $2/GPU hour, comes out to a mere $5.576 million. That seems impossibly low. DeepSeek is clear that these costs are only for the final training run, and exclude all other expenses; from the V3 paper: Lastly, we emphasize again the economical training costs of DeepSeek-V3, summarized in Table 1, achieved through our optimized co-design of algorithms, frameworks, and hardware. During the pre-training stage, training DeepSeek-V3 on each trillion tokens requires only 180K H800 GPU hours, i.e., 3.7 days on our cluster with 2048 H800 GPUs. Consequently, our pre- training stage is completed in less than two months and costs 2664K GPU hours. Combined with 119K GPU hours for the context length extension and 5K GPU hours for post-training, DeepSeek-V3 costs only 2.788M GPU hours for its full training. Assuming the rental price of the H800 GPU is $2 per GPU hour, our total training costs amount to only $5.576M. Note that the aforementioned costs include only the official training of DeepSeek-V3, excluding the costs associated with prior research and ablation experiments on architectures, algorithms, or data. So no, you can’t replicate DeepSeek the company for $5.576 million. I still don’t believe that number. Actually, the burden of proof is on the doubters, at least once you understand the V3 architecture. Remember that bit about DeepSeekMoE: V3 has 671 billion parameters, but only 37 billion parameters in the active expert are computed per token; this equates to 333.3 billion FLOPs of compute per token. Here I should mention another DeepSeek innovation: while parameters were stored with BF16 or FP32 precision, they were reduced to FP8 precision for calculations; 2048 H800 GPUs have a capacity of 3.97 exoflops, i.e. 3.97 billion billion FLOPS. The training set, meanwhile, consisted of 14.8 trillion tokens; once you do all of the math it becomes apparent that 2.8 million H800 hours is sufficient for training V3. Again, this was just the final run, not the total cost, but it’s a plausible number. Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang said they have 50,000 H100s. I don’t know where Wang got his information; I’m guessing he’s referring to this November 2024 tweet from Dylan Patel, which says that DeepSeek had “over 50k Hopper GPUs”. H800s, however, are Hopper GPUs, they just have much more constrained memory bandwidth than H100s because of U.S. sanctions. Here’s the thing: a huge number of the innovations I explained above are about overcoming the lack of memory bandwidth implied in using H800s instead of H100s. Moreover, if you actually did the math on the previous question, you would realize that DeepSeek actually had an excess of computing; that’s because DeepSeek actually programmed 20 of the 132 processing units on each H800 specifically to manage cross-chip communications. This is actually impossible to do in CUDA. DeepSeek engineers had to drop down to PTX, a low-level instruction set for Nvidia GPUs that is basically like assembly language. This is an insane level of optimization that only makes sense if you are using H800s. Meanwhile, DeepSeek also makes their models available for inference: that requires a whole bunch of GPUs above-and-beyond whatever was used for training. So was this a violation of the chip ban? Nope. H100s were prohibited by the chip ban, but not H800s. Everyone assumed that training leading edge models required more interchip memory bandwidth, but that is exactly what DeepSeek optimized both their model structure and infrastructure around. Again, just to emphasize this point, all of the decisions DeepSeek made in the design of this model only make sense if you are constrained to the H800; if DeepSeek had access to H100s, they probably would have used a larger training cluster with much fewer optimizations specifically focused on overcoming the lack of bandwidth. So V3 is a leading edge model? It’s definitely competitive with OpenAI’s 4o and Anthropic’s Sonnet-3.5, and appears to be better than Llama’s biggest model. What does seem likely is that DeepSeek was able to distill those models to give V3 high quality tokens to train on. What is distillation? Distillation is a means of extracting understanding from another model; you can send inputs to the teacher model and record the outputs, and use that to train the student model. This is how you get models like GPT-4 Turbo from GPT-4. Distillation is easier for a company to do on its own models, because they have full access, but you can still do distillation in a somewhat more unwieldy way via API, or even, if you get creative, via chat clients. Distillation obviously violates the terms of service of various models, but the only way to stop it is to actually cut off access, via IP banning, rate limiting, etc. It’s assumed to be widespread in terms of model training, and is why there are an ever-increasing number of models converging on GPT-4o quality. This doesn’t mean that we know for a fact that DeepSeek distilled 4o or Claude, but frankly, it would be odd if they didn’t. Distillation seems terrible for leading edge models. It is! On the positive side, OpenAI and Anthropic and Google are almost certainly using distillation to optimize the models they use for inference for their consumer-facing apps; on the negative side, they are effectively bearing the entire cost of training the leading edge, while everyone else is free-riding on their investment. Indeed, this is probably the core economic factor undergirding the slow divorce of Microsoft and OpenAI. Microsoft is interested in providing inference to its customers, but much less enthused about funding $100 billion data centers to train leading edge models that are likely to be commoditized long before that $100 billion is depreciated. Is this why all of the Big Tech stock prices are down? In the long run, model commoditization and cheaper inference — which DeepSeek has also demonstrated — is great for Big Tech. A world where Microsoft gets to provide inference to its customers for a fraction of the cost means that Microsoft has to spend less on data centers and GPUs, or, just as likely, sees dramatically higher usage given that inference is so much cheaper. Another big winner is Amazon: AWS has by-and-large failed to make their own quality model, but that doesn’t matter if there are very high quality open source models that they can serve at far lower costs than expected. Apple is also a big winner. Dramatically decreased memory requirements for inference make edge inference much more viable, and Apple has the best hardware for exactly that. Apple Silicon uses unified memory, which means that the CPU, GPU, and NPU (neural processing unit) have access to a shared pool of memory; this means that Apple’s high-end hardware actually has the best consumer chip for inference (Nvidia gaming GPUs max out at 32GB of VRAM, while Apple’s chips go up to 192 GB of RAM). Meta, meanwhile, is the biggest winner of all. I already laid out last fall how every aspect of Meta’s business benefits from AI; a big barrier to realizing that vision is the cost of inference, which means that dramatically cheaper inference — and dramatically cheaper training, given the need for Meta to stay on the cutting edge — makes that vision much more achievable. Google, meanwhile, is probably in worse shape: a world of decreased hardware requirements lessens the relative advantage they have from TPUs. More importantly, a world of zero-cost inference increases the viability and likelihood of products that displace search; granted, Google gets lower costs as well, but any change from the status quo is probably a net negative. I asked why the stock prices are down; you just painted a positive picture! My picture is of the long run; today is the short run, and it seems likely the market is working through the shock of R1’s existence. Wait, you haven’t even talked about R1 yet. R1 is a reasoning model like OpenAI’s o1. It has the ability to think through a problem, producing much higher quality results, particularly in areas like coding, math, and logic (but I repeat myself). Is this more impressive than V3? Actually, the reason why I spent so much time on V3 is that that was the model that actually demonstrated a lot of the dynamics that seem to be generating so much surprise and controversy. R1 is notable, however, because o1 stood alone as the only reasoning model on the market, and the clearest sign that OpenAI was the market leader. R1 undoes the o1 mythology in a couple of important ways. First, there is the fact that it exists. OpenAI does not have some sort of special sauce that can’t be replicated. Second, R1 — like all of DeepSeek’s models — has open weights (the problem with saying “open source” is that we don’t have the data that went into creating it). This means that instead of paying OpenAI to get reasoning, you can run R1 on the server of your choice, or even locally, at dramatically lower cost. How did DeepSeek make R1? DeepSeek actually made two models: R1 and R1-Zero. I actually think that R1-Zero is the bigger deal; as I noted above, it was my biggest focus in last Tuesday’s Update: R1-Zero, though, is the bigger deal in my mind. From the paper: In this paper, we take the first step toward improving language model reasoning capabilities using pure reinforcement learning (RL). Our goal is to explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities without any supervised data, focusing on their self-evolution through a pure RL process. Specifically, we use DeepSeek-V3-Base as the base model and employ GRPO as the RL framework to improve model performance in reasoning. During training, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors. After thousands of RL steps, DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits super performance on reasoning benchmarks. For instance, the pass@1 score on AIME 2024 increases from 15.6% to 71.0%, and with majority voting, the score further improves to 86.7%, matching the performance of OpenAI-o1-0912. Reinforcement learning is a technique where a machine learning model is given a bunch of data and a reward function. The classic example is AlphaGo, where DeepMind gave the model the rules of Go with the reward function of winning the game, and then let the model figure everything else on its own. This famously ended up working better than other more human-guided techniques. LLMs to date, however, have relied on reinforcement learning with human feedback; humans are in the loop to help guide the model, navigate difficult choices where rewards aren’t obvious, etc. RLHF was the key innovation in transforming GPT-3 into ChatGPT, with well-formed paragraphs, answers that were concise and didn’t trail off into gibberish, etc. R1-Zero, however, drops the HF part — it’s just reinforcement learning. DeepSeek gave the model a set of math, code, and logic questions, and set two reward functions: one for the right answer, and one for the right format that utilized a thinking process. Moreover, the technique was a simple one: instead of trying to evaluate step-by-step (process supervision), or doing a search of all possible answers (a la AlphaGo), DeepSeek encouraged the model to try several different answers at a time and then graded them according to the two reward functions. What emerged is a model that developed reasoning and chains-of-thought on its own, including what DeepSeek called “Aha Moments”: A particularly intriguing phenomenon observed during the training of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is the occurrence of an “aha moment”. This moment, as illustrated in Table 3, occurs in an intermediate version of the model. During this phase, DeepSeek-R1-Zero learns to allocate more thinking time to a problem by reevaluating its initial approach. This behavior is not only a testament to the model’s growing reasoning abilities but also a captivating example of how reinforcement learning can lead to unexpected and sophisticated outcomes. This moment is not only an “aha moment” for the model but also for the researchers observing its behavior. It underscores the power and beauty of reinforcement learning: rather than explicitly teaching the model on how to solve a problem, we simply provide it with the right incentives, and it autonomously develops advanced problem-solving strategies. The “aha moment” serves as a powerful reminder of the potential of RL to unlock new levels of intelligence in artificial systems, paving the way for more autonomous and adaptive models in the future. This is one of the most powerful affirmations yet of The Bitter Lesson: you don’t need to teach the AI how to reason, you can just give it enough compute and data and it will teach itself! Well, almost: R1-Zero reasons, but in a way that humans have trouble understanding. Back to the introduction: However, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates a small amount of cold-start data and a multi-stage training pipeline. Specifically, we begin by collecting thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. Following this, we perform reasoning-oriented RL like DeepSeek-R1-Zero. Upon nearing convergence in the RL process, we create new SFT data through rejection sampling on the RL checkpoint, combined with supervised data from DeepSeek-V3 in domains such as writing, factual QA, and self-cognition, and then retrain the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. After fine-tuning with the new data, the checkpoint undergoes an additional RL process, taking into account prompts from all scenarios. After these steps, we obtained a checkpoint referred to as DeepSeek-R1, which achieves performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217. This sounds a lot like what OpenAI did for o1: DeepSeek started the model out with a bunch of examples of chain-of-thought thinking so it could learn the proper format for human consumption, and then did the reinforcement learning to enhance its reasoning, along with a number of editing and refinement steps; the output is a model that appears to be very competitive with o1. Here again it seems plausible that DeepSeek benefited from distillation, particularly in terms of training R1. That, though, is itself an important takeaway: we have a situation where AI models are teaching AI models, and where AI models are teaching themselves. We are watching the assembly of an AI takeoff scenario in realtime. So are we close to AGI? It definitely seems like it. This also explains why Softbank (and whatever investors Masayoshi Son brings together) would provide the funding for OpenAI that Microsoft will not: the belief that we are reaching a takeoff point where there will in fact be real returns towards being first. But isn’t R1 now in the lead? I don’t think so; this has been overstated. R1 is competitive with o1, although there do seem to be some holes in its capability that point towards some amount of distillation from o1-Pro. OpenAI, meanwhile, has demonstrated o3, a far more powerful reasoning model. DeepSeek is absolutely the leader in efficiency, but that is different than being the leader overall. So why is everyone freaking out? I think there are multiple factors. First, there is the shock that China has caught up to the leading U.S. labs, despite the widespread assumption that China isn’t as good at software as the U.S.. This is probably the biggest thing I missed in my surprise over the reaction. The reality is that China has an extremely proficient software industry generally, and a very good track record in AI model building specifically. Second is the low training cost for V3, and DeepSeek’s low inference costs. This part was a big surprise for me as well, to be sure, but the numbers are plausible. This, by extension, probably has everyone nervous about Nvidia, which obviously has a big impact on the market. Third is the fact that DeepSeek pulled this off despite the chip ban. Again, though, while there are big loopholes in the chip ban, it seems likely to me that DeepSeek accomplished this with legal chips. I own Nvidia! Am I screwed? There are real challenges this news presents to the Nvidia story. Nvidia has two big moats: These two moats work together. I noted above that if DeepSeek had access to H100s they probably would have used a larger cluster to train their model, simply because that would have been the easier option; the fact they didn’t, and were bandwidth constrained, drove a lot of their decisions in terms of both model architecture and their training infrastructure. Just look at the U.S. labs: they haven’t spent much time on optimization because Nvidia has been aggressively shipping ever more capable systems that accommodate their needs. The route of least resistance has simply been to pay Nvidia. DeepSeek, however, just demonstrated that another route is available: heavy optimization can produce remarkable results on weaker hardware and with lower memory bandwidth; simply paying Nvidia more isn’t the only way to make better models. That noted, there are three factors still in Nvidia’s favor. First, how capable might DeepSeek’s approach be if applied to H100s, or upcoming GB100s? Just because they found a more efficient way to use compute doesn’t mean that more compute wouldn’t be useful. Second, lower inference costs should, in the long run, drive greater usage. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, in a late night tweet almost assuredly directed at the market, said exactly that: Jevons paradox strikes again! As AI gets more efficient and accessible, we will see its use skyrocket, turning it into a commodity we just can't get enough of. https://t.co/omEcOPhdIz Third, reasoning models like R1 and o1 derive their superior performance from using more compute. To the extent that increasing the power and capabilities of AI depend on more compute is the extent that Nvidia stands to benefit! Still, it’s not all rosy. At a minimum DeepSeek’s efficiency and broad availability cast significant doubt on the most optimistic Nvidia growth story, at least in the near term. The payoffs from both model and infrastructure optimization also suggest there are significant gains to be had from exploring alternative approaches to inference in particular. For example, it might be much more plausible to run inference on a standalone AMD GPU, completely sidestepping AMD’s inferior chip-to-chip communications capability. Reasoning models also increase the payoff for inference-only chips that are even more specialized than Nvidia’s GPUs. In short, Nvidia isn’t going anywhere; the Nvidia stock, however, is suddenly facing a lot more uncertainty that hasn’t been priced in. And that, by extension, is going to drag everyone down. So what about the chip ban? The easiest argument to make is that the importance of the chip ban has only been accentuated given the U.S.’s rapidly evaporating lead in software. Software and knowhow can’t be embargoed — we’ve had these debates and realizations before — but chips are physical objects and the U.S. is justified in keeping them away from China. At the same time, there should be some humility about the fact that earlier iterations of the chip ban seem to have directly led to DeepSeek’s innovations. Those innovations, moreover, would extend to not just smuggled Nvidia chips or nerfed ones like the H800, but to Huawei’s Ascend chips as well. Indeed, you can very much make the case that the primary outcome of the chip ban is today’s crash in Nvidia’s stock price. What concerns me is the mindset undergirding something like the chip ban: instead of competing through innovation in the future the U.S. is competing through the denial of innovation in the past. Yes, this may help in the short term — again, DeepSeek would be even more effective with more computing — but in the long run it simply sews the seeds for competition in an industry — chips and semiconductor equipment — over which the U.S. has a dominant position. Like AI models? AI models are a great example. I mentioned above I would get to OpenAI’s greatest crime, which I consider to be the 2023 Biden Executive Order on AI. I wrote in Attenuating Innovation: The point is this: if you accept the premise that regulation locks in incumbents, then it sure is notable that the early AI winners seem the most invested in generating alarm in Washington, D.C. about AI. This despite the fact that their concern is apparently not sufficiently high to, you know, stop their work. No, they are the responsible ones, the ones who care enough to call for regulation; all the better if concerns about imagined harms kneecap inevitable competitors. That paragraph was about OpenAI specifically, and the broader San Francisco AI community generally. For years now we have been subject to hand-wringing about the dangers of AI by the exact same people committed to building it — and controlling it. These alleged dangers were the impetus for OpenAI becoming closed back in 2019 with the release of GPT-2: Due to concerns about large language models being used to generate deceptive, biased, or abusive language at scale, we are only releasing a much smaller version of GPT-2 along with sampling code⁠(opens in a new window). We are not releasing the dataset, training code, or GPT-2 model weights…We are aware that some researchers have the technical capacity to reproduce and open source our results. We believe our release strategy limits the initial set of organizations who may choose to do this, and gives the AI community more time to have a discussion about the implications of such systems. We also think governments should consider expanding or commencing initiatives to more systematically monitor the societal impact and diffusion of AI technologies, and to measure the progression in the capabilities of such systems. If pursued, these efforts could yield a better evidence base for decisions by AI labs and governments regarding publication decisions and AI policy more broadly. The arrogance in this statement is only surpassed by the futility: here we are six years later, and the entire world has access to the weights of a dramatically superior model. OpenAI’s gambit for control — enforced by the U.S. government — has utterly failed. In the meantime, how much innovation has been foregone by virtue of leading edge models not having open weights? More generally, how much time and energy has been spent lobbying for a government-enforced moat that DeepSeek just obliterated, that would have been better devoted to actual innovation? So you’re not worried about AI doom scenarios? I definitely understand the concern, and just noted above that we are reaching the stage where AIs are training AIs and learning reasoning on their own. I recognize, though, that there is no stopping this train. More than that, this is exactly why openness is so important: we need more AIs in the world, not an unaccountable board ruling all of us. Wait, why is China open-sourcing their model? Well DeepSeek is, to be clear; CEO Liang Wenfeng said in a must-read interview that open source is key to attracting talent: In the face of disruptive technologies, moats created by closed source are temporary. Even OpenAI’s closed source approach can’t prevent others from catching up. So we anchor our value in our team — our colleagues grow through this process, accumulate know-how, and form an organization and culture capable of innovation. That’s our moat. Open source, publishing papers, in fact, do not cost us anything. For technical talent, having others follow your innovation gives a great sense of accomplishment. In fact, open source is more of a cultural behavior than a commercial one, and contributing to it earns us respect. There is also a cultural attraction for a company to do this. The interviewer asked if this would change: DeepSeek, right now, has a kind of idealistic aura reminiscent of the early days of OpenAI, and it’s open source. Will you change to closed source later on? Both OpenAI and Mistral moved from open-source to closed-source. We will not change to closed source. We believe having a strong technical ecosystem first is more important. This actually makes sense beyond idealism. If models are commodities — and they are certainly looking that way — then long-term differentiation comes from having a superior cost structure; that is exactly what DeepSeek has delivered, which itself is resonant of how China has come to dominate other industries. This is also contrary to how most U.S. companies think about differentiation, which is through having differentiated products that can sustain larger margins. So is OpenAI screwed? Not necessarily. ChatGPT made OpenAI the accidental consumer tech company, which is to say a product company; there is a route to building a sustainable consumer business on commoditizable models through some combination of subscriptions and advertisements. And, of course, there is the bet on winning the race to AI take-off. Anthropic, on the other hand, is probably the biggest loser of the weekend. DeepSeek made it to number one in the App Store, simply highlighting how Claude, in contrast, hasn’t gotten any traction outside of San Francisco. The API business is doing better, but API businesses in general are the most susceptible to the commoditization trends that seem inevitable (and do note that OpenAI and Anthropic’s inference costs look a lot higher than DeepSeek because they were capturing a lot of margin; that’s going away). So this is all pretty depressing, then? Actually, no. I think that DeepSeek has provided a massive gift to nearly everyone. The biggest winners are consumers and businesses who can anticipate a future of effectively-free AI products and services. Jevons Paradox will rule the day in the long run, and everyone who uses AI will be the biggest winners. Another set of winners are the big consumer tech companies. A world of free AI is a world where product and distribution matters most, and those companies already won that game; The End of the Beginning was right. China is also a big winner, in ways that I suspect will only become apparent over time. Not only does the country have access to DeepSeek, but I suspect that DeepSeek’s relative success to America’s leading AI labs will result in a further unleashing of Chinese innovation as they realize they can compete. That leaves America, and a choice we have to make. We could, for very logical reasons, double down on defensive measures, like massively expanding the chip ban and imposing a permission-based regulatory regime on chips and semiconductor equipment that mirrors the E.U.’s approach to tech; alternatively, we could realize that we have real competition, and actually give ourself permission to compete. Stop wringing our hands, stop campaigning for regulations — indeed, go the other way, and cut out all of the cruft in our companies that has nothing to do with winning. If we choose to compete we can still win, and, if we do, we will have a Chinese company to thank. I wrote a follow-up to this Article in this Daily Update.

Title: Bitcoin briefly falls below $100,000 as China AI threat sparks stock market rout

Bitcoin briefly dipped below $100,000 early Monday as a global technology stock sell-off rattled markets to start the week. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was down 3.51% as of Monday morning, bringing its price to $101,295 apiece. That was a recovery from a low of about $97,900 earlier in the day. Bitcoin has been boosted in recent months by President Donald Trump’s return to the White House, which first sent the popular coin above $100,000 last month in the aftermath of his election victory. Last week, Trump signed an executive order that set the stage for industry-friendly regulations and a national cryptocurrency stockpile — key campaign promises he made to the industry. But Bitcoin isn’t immune from other market turmoil. Contracts for all three major U.S. indices fell tumbled Monday morning as a perceived threat from Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek prompted a global sell-off of tech stocks. Futures of the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged more than 800 points, or roughly 4%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, an index of 30 of the largest U.S. companies including Nvidia (NVDA+3.44%), were also down more than 300 points as of Monday morning. S&P 500 futures tumbled 2%. The sell-off was prompted by DeepSeek’s announcement last week that it launched a model rivaling OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META+2.62%) Llama 3.1 built using lower capability chips from Nvidia, which could put pressure on the semiconductor darling if other firms move away from its premium offerings. In December, the private company launched a free, open source large language model (LLM), which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million. Analysts at Wedbush said in a research note Monday that “tech stocks are under massive pressure led by Nvidia as the Street will view DeepSeek as a major perceived threat to U.S. tech dominance and owning this AI Revolution.” Investors are also awaiting the Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate decision on Wednesday. Fed policymakers are expected to hold rates steady following this week’s meeting, according to the CME FedWatch tool. The Fed reduced rates by a full percentage point in the span of three months last year, bringing the benchmark federal funds rate to 4.25%-4.50%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled a more cautious approach to interest rates this year, as concerns about balancing rising inflation with the strong labor market persist. “As for additional cuts, we’re going to be looking for further progress on inflation as well as continued strength in the labor market,” Powell said in a news conference following the committee’s December meeting. “And as long as the economy and the labor market are solid, we can be cautious as we consider further cuts.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 3% Monday afternoon as a perceived threat from Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek prompted a global sell-off of tech stocks. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index of 30 of the largest U.S. companies including Nvidia (NVDA), went up 109 points or 0.2% as of Monday afternoon. Moreover, the S&P 500 tumbled by 1.8%. The Nasdaq, which has been significantly boosted by AI hype, is especially susceptible to any investor concerns, especially when it comes to AI. And the rise of any competitor to U.S. dominance in the space, especially one that uses less energy and has less of a need for high-end chips, can cause fears to spike. DeepSeek in December launched a free, open source large language model (LLM), which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million. Last week, the company said it launched a model that rivals OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META) Llama 3.1 — and which rose to the top of Apple’s (AAPL) App Store over the weekend. Most notably, DeepSeek built the model using lower capability chips from Nvidia, which could put pressure on the semiconductor darling if other firms move away from its premium offerings. Read more: Nvidia stock plunges 14% as a big advance by China’s DeepSeek rattles AI investors Analysts at Wedbush said in a research note Monday that “tech stocks are under massive pressure led by Nvidia as the Street will view DeepSeek as a major perceived threat to U.S. tech dominance and owning this AI Revolution.” The sell-off was led by Nvidia, whose stock fell as much as 16% Monday afternoon. Other major chip stocks also sank, including ASML (ASML), Broadcom (AVGO), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Micron (MU), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM). “U.S. tech companies are trading at premium valuations, with major AI players like Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) commanding forward [price-to-earnings] multiples far above historical averages,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at investment platform Saxo, in a statement. “With these stocks priced for perfection, even minor disruptions, such as DeepSeek proving advanced AI can be built without top-tier chips, could weigh heavily on share prices.” Analysts at Wedbush said DeepSeek is not yet a real threat to U.S. hyperscalers, and could prompt further capital expenditure from major firms like Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet, and Microsoft. This week, significant earnings reports are due from big tech companies, such as Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT).

Shares of AI companies – which have driven the market in recent months – tumbled amid concerns about a possible lower-cost AI competitor in China. The potential pullback could come after the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite posted two straight winning weeks. The broad-based S&P hit an intraday record on Friday. Earnings will shape the market this week, as more than half of the so-called Magnificent 7 stocks will post results. The Federal Reserve will also announce its latest policy decision Wednesday. Follow live market updates. Shares of AI-linked tech companies including Nvidia, Broadcom and Microsoft fell in premarket trading as investors digested the capabilities of the Chinese startup DeepSeek. The company claims it developed the open-source large-language model it launched in December for only $6 million – a small fraction of the billions U.S. tech companies are spending on AI. Its reasoning model released last week reportedly outperformed OpenAI on several third-party tests. JPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande explained the concern in a note, writing: "Thus, with these considerable sums flowing into AI investments in the US, that Deepseek's highly efficient and lower resource-intensive AI model has shown such significant innovation and success is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible." The concerns over U.S. tech stocks come during a week when many of the sector's key companies will report earnings. Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Tesla will all post results. Outside of tech, other major companies reporting include General Motors, Boeing, Starbucks, Comcast, Chevron and Exxon Mobil. Here are the key results to watch this week: The first potential trade war of the second Trump administration ended before it really started. The White House delayed threatened 25% tariffs on Colombian goods after it said the South American nation reversed course and agreed to accept U.S. military flights carrying deported migrants. While Colombia is not one of the main U.S. trading partners, it is the second largest provider of coffee to the U.S., and is a major crude oil exporter. Investors and consumers are still waiting to see whether President Donald Trump will slap tariffs on Chinese, Canadian and Mexican goods. While Trump has had a friendly ties with many business sectors, his relationship with pharmaceutical companies hasn't always been smooth. The industry hopes that will change during Trump's second term in office. Executives are eager to see whether the White House tries to reform the insurance middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers. They are also watching to see whether Trump or the Republican Congress try to make any changes to Medicare drug price negotiations with Congress.

Title: The Tempi tragedy, the truth, Putin, Tsipras at the Kremlin, and how we ended up empty-handed (a true story), National Insurance, and Maris

Greetings. A comment on yesterday’s very large gatherings for Tempi, given the time of year we’re in.The train accident that claimed the lives of 57 young people is an event that will always shock, move, and enrage public opinion because everyone relates to the tragedy of those 57 families, imagining that it could have been their own child. That’s why the Justice system must do its job properly. Personally, I can’t believe that any judge would fail to perform their duties in a case involving such a tragedy. Beyond that, the families of the lost children deserve nothing but respect, regardless of what they say or believe, as do the thousands of ordinary people who stand by them with genuine feelings of grief and inexpressible pain. However, when politicians and professional unionists—especially those from the two other parties that governed for years and shaped the image of a broken railway system riddled with political favors—step in, there’s a limit to what one can tolerate. I would have expected the mainstream opposition, especially PASOK, to use the Tempi anniversary and the massive gatherings as an opportunity to demand from the government a genuine investigation into the current state of the railway system so that we all know whether the necessary measures have been taken to prevent another tragic accident. As for SYRIZA, which attended the gathering, it would have been good if they had shown up to the gatherings for the Mati wildfire victims—which, of course, never happened for reasons we all understand. Ten Years Since “First Time Left”A few days ago marked ten years since the “First Time Left” government, with a sprinkle of far-right nationalism (courtesy of Panos Kammenos’ “Fatherland – Religion – Family” rhetoric), came to power with its well-documented consequences for the country. These have been analyzed extensively by journalists like us, as well as by politicians, historians, etc. Today, I’ll share with you an unknown incident from that chaotic period, particularly the first year, 2015, when the SYRIZA-ANEL government was scrambling to find money to break Greece’s chains from the Western creditors. This, of course, turned out to be utterly impossible and utopian, despite the legendary front-page headline of the late Kouris that read: “All of Europe Hangs on Alexis’ Heavy Balls,” with a subheading: “Tsipras Took Them Out, Weighed Them, and Is Ready to Show Them.” Before Tsipras could “show them,” however, he needed to find money because, as we all know, people can’t live on “heavy balls” alone, as the iconic headline suggested. So the SYRIZA people first went to the Chinese, who told them they could only lend a hundred million euros—an amount that wouldn’t even cover a week’s expenses, considering that Europeans and Americans collectively loaned Greece about 350 billion euros. At the Kremlin with PutinSo, the government turned to Russia, and the great Lafazanis, then Minister of Energy, assured Alexis that all it would take was a visit and a one-on-one meeting with “Father Putin,” and Mother Russia would open her endless purse strings and drown Greece in cash, freeing the people from the oppressive European creditors. And so, the leader (perhaps naively) agreed, and a meeting was arranged—under the guise of discussing energy cooperation—at the Kremlin between Vladimir and Alexis. Someone familiar with the content of the meeting recounts that Putin immediately left Tsipras speechless, giving him no wiggle room by explaining from the start that, yes, Russia is a great power, but it doesn’t have the ability to lend such enormous amounts to any country, let alone Greece. He also explained that politically, Russia couldn’t intervene in a country within another sphere of influence, reminding the Greek prime minister of something like: “Big guy, Churchill and Stalin settled these matters on a napkin at the end of World War II.” We’re Besties with Angela…What’s even more intriguing is what Putin told Tsipras at the end of their conversation, along with his rejection of the financial request. Reportedly, the Russian president told him: “Apart from everything else, you know, Alexis, Angela and I have an excellent relationship, and I wouldn’t want to spoil it!” Putin’s statement became even clearer years later, during the Ukraine war, when it was revealed that Germany had been receiving Russian natural gas at half-price during Angela Merkel’s chancellorship. But there’s more: the Russian president is said to have done something even more shocking. A few hours after the meeting, he allegedly called Merkel and ratted out the Greeks for coming to him asking for money. Needless to say, I can only imagine what Lafazanis heard from Tsipras afterward and how lucky we are to have avoided what could have been. Today, we’re here writing stories instead of living them. Banks Await Ratings Verdict After InterviewsAfter recently being interviewed by the rating agency S&P, Greek banks are awaiting their verdict (expected later this month or early next month). The evaluation will concern only the banks and not the Greek state, as the agency has scheduled April 18 as the date for assessing the national economy. National Insurance: Sale of Syngrou Building Postponed – Low OffersThe management of National Insurance evaluated the offers received for the sale of its property on Syngrou Avenue and decided to shelve them. Although the company remains committed to selling this prime asset, it is not willing to agree to a price lower than what it believes the property is worth. This decision indicates that the insurer does not currently face liquidity needs. It also reflects that the offers were below the valuation threshold the company had set. Meanwhile, renovations of the company’s building on Karageorgi Servias Street are progressing to accommodate employees currently based on Syngrou Avenue back in central Athens. Among other things, this means that if the desired price for the Syngrou property takes time to materialize, the insurer could explore alternative ways to commercially utilize the property. It seems that, at least for now, the acquisition of Open by Dimitris Maris has not progressed, as Savvidis’ side has stated—yet again—that the channel is not for sale. However, Dimitris Maris, who the market believes has relocated to New York (though reliable friends tell me he’s currently residing in Filopappou), appears determined to intensify his business activity in Greece. He is already active in betting companies and media (owning news247.gr and sports24.gr). Last Friday, January 24, the company Deep Capital Holding S.A. was established, headquartered on Vasilissis Sofias Avenue, specializing in “portfolio management services”—essentially a holding company designed to host a variety of ventures. The initial share capital amounts to €700,000, corresponding to 70,000 shares of €10 each, fully contributed by Dimitris Maris. The first Board of Directors consists of Maris as Chairman and Alexandros Chatzopoulos and Polytimi Dalamanga as members. Polytimi Dalamanga is a long-time collaborator of Maris, while lawyer Alexandros Chatzopoulos joined Deep Capital Group in November 2022 as General Manager of Corporate Affairs. In the past, Chatzopoulos has held senior positions at Philip Morris International, Papastratos, and SEV (the Hellenic Federation of Enterprises). Earlier, from 2009 to 2011, he served as a strategic planning and communications advisor in the office of Prime Minister George Papandreou. Evidently, this new company serves as an “extension” of Dimitris Maris’ Deep Capital Group, which operates in over 10 countries, with investments in Kaizen Gaming, 24 Media Participations, and other businesses, focusing on technology, media, and real estate sectors. In a special ceremony to be held today, the Senate of the University of Piraeus will confer an honorary doctorate on Christos Megalou, CEO of Piraeus Bank. The collaboration between the bank and the university runs deep, as they jointly created the first postgraduate program specializing in Sustainable Development: the “MBA in Sustainability powered by Piraeus.” This program is offered tuition-free and is coordinated by the university’s Department of Business Organization and Management, having launched last October. The Frankfurt-listed construction group Hochtief has long been absent from pursuing new major concessions or PPP contracts in Greece. Two months ago, the German-origin group struck a deal with its partners in the Olympia Odos consortium (Vinci, AVAX, GEK TERNA, and AKTOR) to sell its 17% stake in the “Olympia Odos” for €100 million. This places the total valuation of the concession at around €600 million—equivalent to what GEK TERNA estimates it will earn annually from its two major concessions, Attiki Odos and Egnatia Odos. Hochtief operates across Europe, North America, and Australia. Since 2007, the Spanish construction giant ACS has held a 75.7% stake in the company. Rumors suggest that the Spaniards and Germans no longer see a competitive edge in the Greek market. Consequently, there is growing speculation that Hochtief’s next move will be to sell its 38.89% stake in the “Aegean Motorway” consortium. In this consortium, Hochtief holds the largest share, followed by AVAX (23.61%), AKTOR Concessions (22%), and the French group Vinci Concessions (15.18%). In recent weeks, fresh money has been pouring into the stock market, with existing players strengthening their positions, resulting in record-breaking milestones. The General Index hit a new 14-year high, aiming for the 1,550-point mark—last seen on April 7, 2011. Similarly, the FTSE 25/Large Cap index and the Mid Cap index are at 11- and 15-year highs, respectively. Among individual stocks, PPC (Public Power Corporation) reached a 15-year high, climbing to €13.14 during the trading day before closing at €12.95—the best closing price since August 19, 2010. National Bank of Greece matched its previous record of €8.52 from May 20, 2024, with further gains taking it back to November 27, 2015, when it reached €12.1. Piraeus Bank achieved a 4-year record, surpassing €4.4 and hitting its highest level since April 2021. Meanwhile, IDEAL Holdings will soon brief analysts and shareholders on the details of its Barba Stathis acquisition. This week, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday and the European Central Bank on Thursday will announce decisions on interest rates for the US Dollar and the Euro, respectively. In the US, no rate cuts are expected. However, in Europe, political pressures on central bankers are immense. If Christine Lagarde cuts Euro interest rates, highly indebted businesses will breathe a sigh of relief. On the other hand, if rates remain unchanged, banks—already driving the rise in stock markets—stand to benefit. Meanwhile, Europe, particularly Italy, is seeing seismic shifts in banking acquisitions and mergers. After UniCredit delayed its merger with Commerzbank pending German election results, the third-largest Italian bank, Banco BPM, made a bid to acquire asset manager Anima Holding in November, only to become a target for acquisition by UniCredit shortly thereafter. Last week, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena upped the ante with a €13.3 billion offer to acquire competitor Mediobanca. The final chapter for Tupperware in Greece has been written! Despite being one of the profitable subsidiaries of the American group, the closure could not be averted due to the parent company’s heavy burdens. About a year after the closure of its factory in Greece, the company is now ceasing all operations in the country. The parent company has decided to dissolve and liquidate the Greek subsidiary, appointing two liquidators to oversee the process. One week from today, Attica Holdings will kick off its “Around the World in 80 Days” tour in London, aiming for a well-executed placement to boost stock liquidity and align with the new free-float rules set by the Athens Stock Exchange. Next Monday’s presentation, organized by UBS, Euroxx, and Piraeus Securities, will host about 30 London-based fund managers tasked with evaluating the Group’s growth prospects in light of Greece’s booming tourism sector. Ahead of the London meeting, Attica Group’s stock surged by 7.66% on Friday, closing at €2.39—raising the valuation of Greece’s largest passenger ferry company to €581.16 million. Today, the largest shareholder of Attica Group is STRIX Holdings L.P., which controls 25.4% directly and 61.3% indirectly through its subsidiary MIG Shipping S.A. Significant room exists to expand the shareholder base—provided the consultants give the green light this time. The next session of the European Council, set to take place at the Palais d’Egmont in Brussels, where EU leaders will discuss a unified European policy in response to the new Trump challenge, will mark the first Summit under the Polish Presidency of the EU. Beyond discussions on European Defense issues, new priorities for common industrial policy will also be on the agenda. At this juncture, Greece and Italy have developed a joint platform aimed at a “productive model transformation.” Greece’s Minister of Development, Takis Theodorikakos, along with his Italian counterpart, Minister of Entrepreneurship Adolfo Urso, have already submitted a joint proposal to the presiding Polish Prime Minister, Donald Tusk, focusing on strengthening investments, bolstering industry, and financing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The timing of the Polish Presidency—following Hungary’s tumultuous and unproductive tenure—is especially critical, coinciding with the start of the EU’s new three-year funding period for 2025–2027. Greece has already submitted its own plan for transforming its productive model, while next Friday, the Greek Cabinet will include the issue of the Quality Strategy in its agenda. This marks an important legislative initiative for the National Quality System, which is a prerequisite and milestone for approving the sixth payment request from the Resilience and Recovery Fund. Last Saturday, President Trump visited Las Vegas for yet another “victory lap.” He addressed hundreds of enthusiastic supporters at the Circa Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. His first promise as the newly elected President was to fulfill his campaign pledge to abolish the tip taxes imposed during the Biden administration. “We’re going to get this done for you—no tax on tips,” Trump announced to a roaring crowd, standing behind a podium emblazoned with the same slogan used throughout his 2024 campaign. Trump’s message to Nevada’s hospitality workers was crystal clear: he intends to eliminate income taxes on tips. In Las Vegas, a 24/7 economy relies heavily on tips to support thousands of workers in the hospitality industry—from waiters and valets to hotel housekeepers, hairstylists, taxi drivers, and countless others. Nevada has the highest concentration of workers in this sector, with approximately 25.8 waiters and waitresses per 1,000 jobs, followed by Hawaii and Florida. By pledging to abolish tipping taxes, Trump managed to secure electoral victories in all these states. Interestingly, this issue also seems to resonate in Greece, where the Ministry of Finance is closely monitoring Trump’s March legislation to draw inspiration for its own fiscal reforms. One of the main reasons all the CEOs of the tech giants on the U.S. West Coast have openly supported Donald Trump (he even confided a few days ago that Elon Musk spearheaded his campaign in Pennsylvania!) is the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and the immense power these tech titans aim to harness by controlling AI. A striking example is Mark Zuckerberg’s interview, which was extensively covered in a New York Times feature, outlining how he plans to eliminate lower-tier programming positions at Meta. Essentially, the founder of Facebook signaled the dawn of a new labor market—one far more employer-friendly. But then, the unexpected happened. On Christmas Day, a Chinese-origin computational model named Deepseek shook the landscape. It managed to compete against postdoctoral mathematics students at just 5% of the cost of OpenAI’s top-tier model (o1) while using only 1% of the GPU power for training. Additionally, this model demonstrated remarkable learning capabilities, is open-access, and allows operation on simple computers through a complex compression process. The sudden emergence of Deepseek prompted the hasty announcement of Project Stargate, with prominent figures like Masayoshi Son and Oracle’s Larry Ellison promising breakthroughs like curing cancer. Meanwhile, Elon Musk continues to clash with Sam Altman (CEO of OpenAI) on X. This story is far from over and promises to unfold with fascinating developments. Explore related questions

Title: DeepSeek's 'cheap' Chinese AI chatbot sparks tech stock selloff

US tech giant Nvidia lost over a sixth of its value after the surging popularity of a Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) app spooked investors in the US and Europe. DeepSeek, a Chinese AI chatbot reportedly made at a fraction of the cost of its rivals, launched last week but has already become the most downloaded free app in the US. AI chip giant Nvidia and other tech firms connected to AI, including Microsoft and Google, saw their values tumble on Monday in the wake of DeepSeek's sudden rise. In a separate development, DeepSeek said on Monday it will temporarily limit registrations because of "large-scale malicious attacks" on its software. The DeepSeek chatbot was reportedly developed for a fraction of the cost of its rivals, raising questions about the future of America's AI dominance and the scale of investments US firms are planning. Last week, OpenAI joined a group of other firms who pledged to invest $500bn (£400bn) in building AI infrastructure in the US. President Donald Trump, in one of his first announcements since returning to office, called it "the largest AI infrastructure project by far in history" that would help keep "the future of technology" in the US. DeepSeek is powered by the open source DeepSeek-V3 model, which its researchers claim was trained for around $6m - significantly less than the billions spent by rivals. But this claim has been disputed by others in AI. The researchers say they use already existing technology, as well as open source code - software that can be used, modified or distributed by anybody free of charge. DeepSeek's emergence comes as the US is restricting the sale of the advanced chip technology that powers AI to China. To continue their work without steady supplies of imported advanced chips, Chinese AI developers have shared their work with each other and experimented with new approaches to the technology. This has resulted in AI models that require far less computing power than before. It also means that they cost a lot less than previously thought possible, which has the potential to upend the industry. After DeepSeek-R1 was launched earlier this month, the company boasted of "performance on par with" one of OpenAI's latest models when used for tasks such as maths, coding and natural language reasoning. Silicon Valley venture capitalist and Trump adviser Marc Andreessen described DeepSeek-R1 as "AI's Sputnik moment", a reference to the satellite launched by the Soviet Union in 1957. At the time, the US was considered to have been caught off-guard by their rival's technological achievement. DeepSeek's sudden popularity has startled stock markets in Europe and the US. In the US, AI chipmaker Nvidia ended Monday's trading having plunged 16.9% while its rival Broadcom slumped 17.4%. Other tech firms also sank, with Microsoft down 2.14% and Google's owner Alphabet down over 4%. In Europe, Dutch chip equipment maker ASML ended Monday's trading with its share price down by more than 7% while shares in Siemens Energy, which makes hardware related to AI, had plunged by a fifth. "This idea of a low-cost Chinese version hasn't necessarily been forefront, so it's taken the market a little bit by surprise," said Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index. "So, if you suddenly get this low-cost AI model, then that's going to raise concerns over the profits of rivals, particularly given the amount that they've already invested in more expensive AI infrastructure." Singapore-based technology equity adviser Vey-Sern Ling told the BBC it could "potentially derail the investment case for the entire AI supply chain". But Wall Street banking giant Citi cautioned that while DeepSeek could challenge the dominant positions of American companies such as OpenAI, issues faced by Chinese firms could hamper their development. "We estimate that in an inevitably more restrictive environment, US access to more advanced chips is an advantage," analysts said in a report. Meanwhile, DeepSeek said on Monday it had been the victim of a cyberattack. "Due to large-scale malicious attacks on DeepSeek's services, we are temporarily limiting registrations to ensure continued service," it said in a statement. "Existing users can log in as usual. Thanks for your understanding and support." The company was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng in Hangzhou, a city in southeastern China. The 40-year-old, an information and electronic engineering graduate, also founded the hedge fund that backed DeepSeek. He reportedly built up a store of Nvidia A100 chips, now banned from export to China. Experts believe this collection - which some estimates put at 50,000 - led him to launch DeepSeek, by pairing these chips with cheaper, lower-end ones that are still available to import. Mr Liang was recently seen at a meeting between industry experts and the Chinese premier Li Qiang. In a July 2024 interview with The China Academy, Mr Liang said he was surprised by the reaction to the previous version of his AI model. "We didn't expect pricing to be such a sensitive issue," he said. "We were simply following our own pace, calculating costs, and setting prices accordingly."

Beijing, China. Photo: Getty DeepSeek, an AI startup just over a year old, stirred awe and consternation in Silicon Valley with its breakthrough artificial intelligence model that offered comparable performance to the world's best chatbots at seemingly a fraction of the cost. Created in China's Hangzhou, DeepSeek carries far-reaching implications for the global tech industry and supply chain, offering a counterpoint to the widespread belief that the future of AI will require ever-increasing amounts of power and energy to develop. What exactly is DeepSeek? DeepSeek is a Chinese startup founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, the chief of AI-driven quant hedge fund High-Flyer. The company develops open-source AI models, and its eponymous mobile app surged to the top of the iPhone's download charts in the US after its release in early January. The DeepSeek app distinguishes itself from other chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT by articulating its reasoning before delivering a response to a prompt. The company claims its R1 release offers performance on par with OpenAI's latest and has granted license for individuals interested in developing chatbots on the technology to build on it. How does DeepSeek R1 compare to OpenAI or Meta AI? Though not fully detailed by the company, the cost of training and developing DeepSeek's models appears to be only a fraction of what's required for OpenAI or Meta Platforms Inc.'s best products. The much better efficiency of the model puts into question the need for vast expenditures of capital to acquire the latest and most powerful AI accelerators from the likes of Nvidia Corp. That also amplifies attention on US export curbs of such advanced semiconductors to China â€ which were intended to prevent a breakthrough of the sort that DeepSeek seems to represent. DeepSeek R1 is near or better than rival models in several leading benchmarks such as AIME 2024 for mathematical tasks, MMLU for general knowledge and AlpacaEval 2.0 for question-and-answer performance. It also ranks among the top performers on a UC Berkeley-affiliated leaderboard called Chatbot Arena. What's raising alarm in the US? Washington has banned the export of high-end technologies like GPU semiconductors to China, in a bid to stall the country's advances in AI, the pivotal frontier in the US-China contest for tech supremacy. But DeepSeek's progress suggests Chinese AI engineers have worked their way around the restrictions, focusing on greater efficiency with limited resources. While it remains unclear how much advanced AI-training hardware DeepSeek has had access to, the company's demonstrated enough to suggest the trade restrictions have not been entirely effective in stymying China's progress. When did DeepSeek spark global interest? The AI developer has been closely watched since the release of its earliest model in 2023. Then in November, it gave the world a glimpse of its DeepSeek R1 reasoning model, designed to mimic human thinking. That model underpins its mobile chatbot app, which together with the web interface in January rocketed to global renown as a much cheaper OpenAI alternative, with investor Marc Andreessen calling it "AI's Sputnik moment." The DeepSeek mobile app was downloaded 1.6 million times by Jan. 25 and ranked No. 1 in iPhone app stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the US and the UK, according to data from market tracker App Figures. Who is DeepSeek's founder? Born in Guangdong in 1985, Liang received bachelor's and masters' degrees in electronic and information engineering from Zhejiang University. He founded DeepSeek with only 10 million yuan ($1.4m) in registered capital, according to company database Tianyancha. The bottleneck for further advances is not more fundraising, Liang said in an interview with Chinese outlet 36kr, but US restrictions on access to the best chips. Most of his top researchers were fresh graduates from top Chinese universities, he said, stressing the need for China to develop its own domestic ecosystem akin to the one built around Nvidia and its AI chips. "More investment does not necessarily lead to more innovation. Otherwise, large companies would take over all innovation," Liang said. Where does DeepSeek stand in China's AI landscape? China's technology leaders, from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc. to Tencent Holdings Ltd., have poured significant money and resources into the race to acquire hardware and customers for their AI ventures. Alongside Kai-Fu Lee's 01.AI startup, DeepSeek stands out with its open-source approach designed to recruit the largest number of users quickly before developing monetization strategies atop that large audience. Because DeepSeek's models are more affordable, it's already played a role in helping drive down costs for AI developers in China, where the bigger players have engaged in a price war that's seen successive waves of price cuts over the past year and a half. What are the implications for the global AI marketplace? DeepSeek's success may push OpenAI and other US providers to lower their pricing to maintain their established lead. It also calls into question the vast spending by companies like Meta and Microsoft Corp each of which has committed to capex of $65 billion or more this year, largely on AI infrastructure â€ if more efficient models can compete with a much smaller outlay. That roiled Asia stock markets as investors sought Chinese names linked to DeepSeek, such as Iflytek Co., and moved away from chipmaking supply chain names like Advantest Corp. that may be exposed to any shortfall in expected demand for AI semiconductors. Already, developers around the world are experimenting with DeepSeek's software and looking to build tools with it. That could quicken the adoption of advanced AI reasoning models while also potentially touching off additional concern about the need for guardrails around their use. DeepSeek's advances may hasten regulation to control how AI is developed. What are DeepSeek's shortcomings? Like all other Chinese AI models, DeepSeek self-censors on topics deemed sensitive in China. It deflects queries about Tiananmen Square or geopolitically fraught questions like the possibility of China invading Taiwan. In tests, the DeepSeek bot is capable of giving detailed responses about political figures like Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but declines to do so about Chinese President Xi Jinping. DeepSeek's cloud infrastructure is likely to be tested by its sudden popularity. The company briefly experienced a major outage on Jan. 27 and will have to manage even more traffic as new and returning users pour more queries into its chatbot.

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Chip designer NVIDIA Corporation's shares shed more than $300 billion in value in premarket trading today as investors speculated about the implications of Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek being able to train models on par with their American counterparts at a lower budget. DeepSeek's R1 model made a splash earlier this month to quickly become the most downloaded application on Apple's AppStore over the weekend. NVIDIA's shares were down by 11% in premarket trading as they joined peers from Japan and European chip equipment manufacturer ASML to report low single-digit percentage share price losses. Today's stock market selloff, which started soon after trading opened in Japan, affected data center stocks in the Asian country, the shares of chip manufacturing equipment provider ASML and NVIDIA. It was also reflected in the NASDAQ's futures and the VanEck Semiconductor ETF. ASML, which is highly exposed to the global semiconductor industry due to its status as the sole provider of advanced EUV chip manufacturing machines, saw its shares tumble by a whopping 11% in Europe ahead of its crucial earnings report due later this which will set the pace for 2025 AI expectations. The stock had already bled 22% in October last year when the firm guided weak equipment demand for 2025 and caused investors to price out some of their AI-related demand expectations. ASML's ADRs that trade on the NASDAQ exchange are down by 11% in premarket trading to remove roughly $30 billion from its valuation. Over the past six months, the ADRs are down by 16% excluding today's premarket losses. Japanese investment conglomerate Softbank, which sought to create headlines earlier this month through President Trump's $500 billion AI initiative, was down by 8.32% in Japanese markets. Chip testing equipment manufacturer Advantest also slid by 8.6%. Yet, due to its massive market valuation that made it the most valuable company in the world last week, NVIDIA's market cap has taken the hardest hit from the DeepSeek fallout. Its shares have lost roughly 11% in premarket trading to wipe out a stunning ~$384 billion in value from where it last stood as trading closed last week. NVIDIA's shares traded in Germany are down by an even larger 11.7%. After NVIDIA, one of the worst-hit chip stocks is semiconductor designer Broadcom. Its shares had soared by an unbelievable 38% in December when management shared that the firm expects to earn tens of billions of dollars through AI chip sales in 2027. However, as investors ponder whether the demand for AI chips will actually materialize given the currently held beliefs surrounding DeepSeek's training resources, they are fleeing Broadcom's stock in droves. Its shares are down by 10.5% in premarket trading to remove roughly $100 billion from its Friday valuation. NVIDIA's smaller rival, AMD, is also down by 5.3% in the premarket. While AMD's products, namely its accelerators, are also suitable for AI workloads, NVIDIA's GPUs are the industry leaders and see the highest demand. British chip design house Arm Ltd, whose CEO Rene Haas insisted multiple times earlier this month that his firm's CPUs are alongside all AI GPUs, has shed 9.43%. Other losers include Microsoft Corporation and Facebook's parent company, Meta. Their shares are down by 6% and 4.6% with investors pondering about the wisdom behind their multi-billion dollar capital expenditures. Shares of consumer technology giant Apple, which is only expected to benefit from consumer AI, are unfazed and have lost a mere 0.9% in premarket trading.

Global technology stocks tumbled on Jan. 27 as hype around DeepSeek’s innovation snowballed and investors began to digest the implications for its US-based rivals and AI hardware suppliers such as Nvidia Corp. What exactly is DeepSeek? DeepSeek was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, the chief of AI-driven quant hedge fund High-Flyer. The company develops AI models that are open-source, meaning the developer community at large can inspect and improve the software. Its mobile app surged to the top of the iPhone download charts in the US after its release in early January. The app distinguishes itself from other chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT by articulating its reasoning before delivering a response to a prompt. The company claims its R1 release offers performance on par with the latest iteration of ChatGPT. It is offering licenses for individuals interested in developing chatbots using the technology to build on it, at a price well below what OpenAI charges for similar access. Follow The Big Take daily podcast wherever you listen. How does DeepSeek R1 compare to OpenAI or Meta AI? DeepSeek says R1’s performance approaches or improves on that of rival models in several leading benchmarks such as AIME 2024 for mathematical tasks, MMLU for general knowledge and AlpacaEval 2.0 for question-and-answer performance. It also ranks among the top performers on a UC Berkeley-affiliated leaderboard called Chatbot Arena. Though not fully detailed by the company, the cost of training and developing DeepSeek’s models appears to be only a fraction of what’s required for OpenAI or Meta Platforms Inc.’s best products. The greater efficiency of the model puts into question the need for vast expenditures of capital to acquire the latest and most powerful AI accelerators from the likes of Nvidia. It also focuses attention on US export curbs of such advanced semiconductors to China — which were intended to prevent a breakthrough of the sort that DeepSeek appears to represent. When did DeepSeek spark global interest? The AI developer has been closely watched since the release of its earliest model in 2023. Then in November, it gave the world a glimpse of its DeepSeek R1 reasoning model, designed to mimic human thinking. That model underpins its chatbot app, which exploded in popularity as a much cheaper OpenAI alternative, with investor Marc Andreessen calling it “AI’s Sputnik moment.” The DeepSeek mobile app was downloaded 1.6 million times by Jan. 25 and ranked No. 1 in iPhone app stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the US and the UK, according to data from market tracker App Figures. What did we learn from the giant stock market reaction? For much of the past two-plus years since ChatGPT kicked off the global AI frenzy, investors have bet that improvements in AI will require ever more advanced chips from the likes of Nvidia. The DeepSeek breakthrough suggests AI models are emerging that can achieve a comparable performance using less sophisticated chips for a smaller outlay. Investors offloaded Nvidia stock in response, sending the shares down 17% on Jan. 27 and erasing $589 billion of value from the world’s largest company — a stock market record. Semiconductor machine maker ASML Holding NV and other companies that also benefited from booming demand for cutting-edge AI hardware also tumbled. DeepSeek’s success calls into question the vast spending by companies like Meta and Microsoft Corp. — each of which has committed to capex of $65 billion or more this year, largely on AI infrastructure. Shares in Meta and Microsoft also opened lower, though by smaller margins than Nvidia, with investors weighing the potential for substantial savings on the tech giants’ AI investments. Meta even recovered later in the session to close higher. Chinese names linked to DeepSeek, such as Iflytek Co., also climbed. Some industry watchers suggested the industry overall could benefit from DeepSeek’s breakthrough if it pushes OpenAI and other US providers to cut their prices, spurring faster adoption of AI. How could DeepSeek affect the global strategic competition over AI? AI is the key frontier in the US-China contest for tech supremacy. Washington has banned the export to China of equipment such as high-end graphics processing units in a bid to stall the country’s advances. DeepSeek’s progress suggests Chinese AI engineers have worked their way around those restrictions, focusing on greater efficiency with limited resources. Still, it remains unclear how much advanced AI-training hardware DeepSeek has had access to. Already, developers around the world are experimenting with DeepSeek’s software and looking to build tools with it. This could help US companies improve the efficiency of their AI models and quicken the adoption of advanced AI reasoning. That in turn may force regulators to lay down rules on how these models are used, and to what end. DeepSeek’s progress raises a further question, one that often arises when a Chinese company makes strides into foreign markets: Could the troves of data the mobile app collects and stores in Chinese servers present a privacy or security threats to US citizens? The fact that DeepSeek’s models are open-source opens the possibility that users in the US could take the code and run the models in a way that wouldn’t touch servers in China. Who is DeepSeek’s founder? Born in Guangdong in 1985, engineering graduate Liang has never studied or worked outside of mainland China. He received bachelor’s and masters’ degrees in electronic and information engineering from Zhejiang University. He founded DeepSeek with 10 million yuan ($1.4 million) in registered capital, according to company database Tianyancha. The bottleneck for further advances is not more fundraising, Liang said in an interview with Chinese outlet 36kr, but US restrictions on access to the best chips. Most of his top researchers were fresh graduates from top Chinese universities, he said, stressing the need for China to develop its own domestic ecosystem akin to the one built around Nvidia and its AI chips. “More investment does not necessarily lead to more innovation. Otherwise, large companies would take over all innovation,” Liang said. Liang has been compared to OpenAI founder Sam Altman, but the Chinese citizen keeps a much lower profile and seldom speaks publicly. Where does DeepSeek stand in China’s AI landscape? China’s technology leaders, from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc. to Tencent Holdings Ltd., have poured significant money and resources into the race to acquire hardware and customers for their AI ventures. Alongside Kai-Fu Lee’s 01.AI startup, DeepSeek stands out with its open-source approach — designed to recruit the largest number of users quickly before developing monetization strategies atop that large audience. Because DeepSeek’s models are more affordable, it’s already played a role in helping drive down costs for AI developers in China, where the bigger players have engaged in a price war that’s seen successive waves of price cuts over the past year and a half. What are DeepSeek’s shortcomings? Like all other Chinese AI models, DeepSeek self-censors on topics deemed sensitive in China. It deflects queries about the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests or geopolitically fraught questions such as the possibility of China invading Taiwan. In tests, the DeepSeek bot is capable of giving detailed responses about political figures like Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but declines to do so about Chinese President Xi Jinping. DeepSeek’s cloud infrastructure is likely to be tested by its sudden popularity. The company briefly experienced a major outage on Jan. 27 and will have to manage even more traffic as new and returning users pour more queries into its chatbot. --With assistance from Luz Ding, Zheping Huang, Claire Che, Ville Heiskanen, Mayumi Negishi, Olivia Solon and Jan-Patrick Barnert.

Here's what folks think you actually need to know about saving, spending, and investing. There is a little bit of a catch, however. NEW YORK/LONDON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Global investors dumped tech stocks on Monday as they worried that the emergence of a low-cost Chinese artificial intelligence model would threaten the dominance of AI leaders like Nvidia, evaporating $593 billion of the chipmaker's market value, a record one-day loss for any company on Wall Street. This led the tech-heavy Nasdaq to fall 3.1% on Monday. Nvidia was the Nasdaq's biggest drag, with its shares tumbling just under 17% and marking a record one-day loss in market capitalization for a Wall Street stock, according to LSEG data. The roughly $78 billion the Oracle of Omaha has spent buying this stock since mid-2018 decisively signals it's his favorite. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) roared higher last year, gaining more than 170%, and emerged as the key player in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Nvidia chief Jensen Huang even called the company the "on-ramp" to AI during an interview a few months ago on the BG2Pod podcast. Nvidia is well positioned to benefit over the long term and in the near term. Dividend stocks are gaining investors' attention because of their downside protection during tough economic times. A T.

But there is always a contrarian view – and in this case, it’s laid out by hedge manager Bill Smead, who points out that the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds remains high and continues to edge back toward 5% – a move he believes will dampen enthusiasm for stocks. Smead argues that this reflects the market’s anticipation of persistent inflation and higher interest rates.

A Chinese AI startup dethroned ChatGPT, tanked Nvidia's stock, and triggered a Big Tech panic. Is this the AI tipping point? Many top exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that have been outperforming the S&P 500 in recent years all have a common theme, which is that their top three holdings usually include at least one of the following tech stocks: Nvidia, Microsoft, or Apple. For investors who want to focus on growth stocks but don't want heavy exposure to those three tech giants, one ETF you may want to consider is American Century U.S. Quality Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: QGRO). The fund's top three holdings are Netflix, Booking Holdings, and TJX Companies. Meanwhile, continued climate change concerns mean that the bulk of that power will need to come from lower-carbon sources, like renewable energy. Few companies are in as strong a position to capitalize on this megatrend as Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC)(NYSE: BEP). The leading global renewable energy producer has the scale, expertise, and financial strength to be a driving force in supplying the world with more clean energy in the coming decades.

The Nasdaq Composite lost 3.07%, falling to 19,341.83, and the S&P 500 slid 1.46% to 6,012.28. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 289.33 points, or 0.65%, to close at 44,713.58. Gains in Apple, Johnson & Johnson and Travelers helped lift the 30-stock index. Last week, DeepSeek released R1, an open-source reasoning model that reportedly outperformed OpenAI's in several tests, and has climbed the charts at app stores. DeepSeek said the initial version of its large language model, launched in late December, cost less than $6 million to design. While Wall Street questions that figure, the startup's claims are nonetheless raising concerns that big AI models could be built out with much less investment. AI darling Nvidia dropped nearly 17%, Broadcom lost 17.4%, and AMD shed 6.4%. Microsoft lost 2.1%. Palantir was hit for 4.4%. Derivative plays from the AI buildout such as power providers also suffered. Constellation Energy lost nearly 21%, while Vistra dropped 28%. "It's a good example of selling first and asking questions later, and investors sort of feeling that valuations are a bit stretched for technology in general and for semiconductors in particular," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. "We're going to have volatility, especially when we're dealing with a richly valued market and exogenous events." On the other hand, a rotation into more defensive areas of the market helped ease Monday's losses. "What I've also been encouraged by is investors are not bailing out of stocks necessarily, but are rotating into the defensive areas, like consumer staples, health care, real estate," Stovall added. "The market at least seems to be coming back." Monday's sharp declines come as traders brace for a major week, with "Magnificent Seven" members Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Tesla and Apple all due to report their latest quarterly results. On top of that, the Federal Reserve will hold its first policy meeting of the year, deciding on the level of interest rates Wednesday. Fed funds futures are pricing in a 97% chance that the central bank leaves interest rates unchanged, according to CMEGroup's FedWatch Tool. Weighed down by a technology sell-off, the Nasdaq Composite ended Monday's session lower. The technology-dominated index slipped 3.07% to finish at 19,341.83. The S&P 500 shed 1.46% and closed at 6,012.28. The Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to add 289.33 points, or 0.65%, settling at 44,713.58. — Lisa Kailai Han Even with the Nasdaq Composite down more than 3%, there are some notable tech stocks on track to close higher on the day. Shares of Salesforce were higher by more than 3%. TakeTwo Interactive and Intuit rose more than 1%. Adobe, Service Now and Palo Alto Networks were also on track for modest gains. Those moves could be a sign that cheaper versions of AI models will shift the benefit to different tech stocks. "I think the market's read today, which I generally agree with, is this is good for anyone who uses AI in their business. This is a potential cost-takeout or margin expansion opportunity for companies that use AI," said John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds. — Jesse Pound The risk of tariffs on China from President Donald Trump over the next couple months may not be that significant, according to Barclays. "We think the likelihood of a tariff hike in Q1 is small as President Trump ordered the USTR to assess China's performance under the Phase One deal (due 1 April) and expressed an interest in visiting China," the bank wrote in a Monday note. That said, while Barclays thinks a tariff hike within the quarter isn't likely, it's still "too early to tell" regarding what could happen in the subsequent quarters. "A review of the timeline for US-China trade war 1.0 showed that it remains to be seen how the deal making could evolve and whether and when new tariff threats would materialize," the bank added. The forecast comes as Trump revealed last week that his team is discussing a 10% tariff on China and that the tariff could be imposed as soon as Feb. 1. He had previously vowed to raise tariffs by an additional 10% on all Chinese goods back in November last year. — Sean Conlon The march of a new artificial intelligence lab in China stole a step from the market on Monday, but the number of advancing stocks still outnumbered decliners on the New York Stock Exchange in late day trading, 1481 to 1261. What's more, the number of new NYSE 52-week highs swamped new lows, 73 to 18, according to FactSet data. To be sure, declining volume accounted for nearly 55% of all NYSE volume Monday against advancing volume of 45%. But the numbers were grimmer still on the Nasdaq, where decliners swamped advancers 2565 to 1636, new lows beat new highs 133 to 109 and declining volume accounted for 71% of all shares traded. — Scott Schnipper Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, sees two more rate cuts on the horizon for 2025. "Our base case is that they cut interest rates twice this year, once in the second quarter, and then once again in the fourth quarter," he told CNBC in a Monday interview. As for this Wednesday's FOMC meeting, Stovall is in agreement with many investors who believe that the U.S. central bank will most likely hold rates steady. — Lisa Kailai Han Stifel sees three risks developing this year to threaten the current bull market rally. "First, although some investors expect a smooth hand-off from Growth-led to Value-led (from P/E to EPS), history and our economic views suggest otherwise. Second, we see Core PCE inflation stuck at 2.7% to 2.9% y/y in 2025, implying little possibility of rate cuts until GDP weakens," wrote chief equity strategist Barry Bannister. As the last negative development, Bannister pointed to an elevated U.S. Treasury 10-year yield resulting from policy and inflation, which implies that U.S. economic data could soon weaken. — Lisa Kailai Han Despite today's market selloff, Deutsche Bank believes that stocks remain relatively resilient. "As the last 24 hours have demonstrated, markets remain very sensitive to downside news," wrote strategist Henry Allen in a Monday note. "Nevertheless, periodic selloffs are a normal feature of markets, and as we look forward, several factors that could have caused issues in the recent past are now looking more positive." Still, Allen pointed to four factors that could potentially drag the bull rally down, as follows: — Lisa Kailai Han Canaccord Genuity expects a stock market pullback this quarter to set the stage for another positive year for stocks. "Last week's new closing high in the SPX for the first time in seven weeks, coupled with the slight outperformance of the SPW so far in 2025, is further evidence that the bull market that began in October 2022 remains intact," wrote analyst Michael Welch. "We continue to expect some near-term downside for the SPX and believe a Q1 low will set the stage for another positive year." The analyst added that the median quarter-one drawdown was 4.4% following a year of the S&P 500 gaining over 20%, such as 2024. However, the median calendar year gain following an outperforming year was 12.09%. — Lisa Kailai Han Single-stock ETFs that bet on Nvidia to go up every single day have become very popular, but now they are headed for their worst day on record. The GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL), T-Rex 2X Long Nvidia Daily Target ETF (NVDX) and the Direxion Daily NVDA Bull 2x Shares ETF (NVDU) were all down about 32% in midday trading. Those funds entered the day with about $1.7 billion in combined assets under management, according to FactSet. This is what the funds are designed to do. They are built using to derivatives to deliver two-times the performance of Nvidia on a one-day basis, delivering amplified returns in either direction. On the flipside, funds that bet against Nvidia are having a banner day. The GraniteShares 2x Short NVDA Daily ETF (NVD) is up more than 30%. The short Nvidia funds all entered the day with less than $100 million in assets apiece, however. — Jesse Pound Nvidia's slide on Monday pulled shares below their respective 200-day moving average for the first time in two years. Shares are down nearly 16% on the heels of a broader sell-off in the technology sector, as China's DeepSeek seized investor attention and sparked concern that the AI trade could be losing steam. — Brian Evans, Adrian van Hauwermeiren The artificial intelligence trade has powered the bull market rally for the last two years. Investors have debated whether or not valuations have exceeded their fair prices, but UBS believes that the tech really still has more room to run. "Tech sector volatility could pick up in 2025. But we also expect robust capital spending and further progress on AI monetization, with strong earnings supporting our preferred stocks," wrote strategist Sundeep Gantori in a Monday note. "We view the U.S. IT sector as Attractive due to its promising fundamentals, and recommend investors to use any near-term volatility to build up sufficient exposure to quality AI stocks." — Lisa Kailai Han Bank of America says it's "losing hopes" on monetary policy convergence around the world. While the Federal Reserve can afford to wait before further lowering rates, uncertainty in other G10 economies means that will likely have to keep cutting. The European Central Bank is expected to cut to 1.5%, per economist Claudio Irigoyen, which will widen the rate differential with the Fed. Emerging markets, which broadly have "less anchored inflation expectations," could also see some difficult trade offs, Irigoyen added. — Hakyung Kim The Dow Jones Industrial Average would actually be higher on Monday if it weren't for losses in Nvidia, which is single-handledly taking the market lower on concern that China is suddenly racing ahead in the contest to master artificial intelligence. Nvidia at its low fell $21.81 to $120.80, equal to more than 134 points off the Dow, which Nvidia only joined in early November. Every $1 move up or down in any stock in the Dow, which is calculated based on companies' individual share prices rather than their total market value, raises or lowers the average by 6.15 points. — Scott Schnipper Apple became the most valuable publicly traded company once again on Monday, after Nvidia's rout sent its market value plummeting. Microsoft also surpassed the chipmaker, landing in the number two spot. Shares of Nvidia tumbled 13.5% on concerns over possible competition from Chinese startup DeepSeek, which claims it launched a free, open-source language model at a fraction of the cost of its competitors. Apple's market cap currently sits near $3.4 billion, while Microsoft is at $3.2 billion. Nvidia's market cap is just shy of $3.1 billion. Just last week, Nvidia had reclaimed the top spot, replacing Apple as the most valuable company. — Michelle Fox, Nick Wells Nvidia is on track to notch its largest daily decline in nearly half of a decade as Chinese startup DeepSeek's large language model catalyzed a global tech sell-off. Shares of the artificial intelligence darling slid more than 13% in morning trading. If that holds, Monday would mark Nvidia's worst day since March 2020, when the stock tumbled 18.5% in a session. With Monday's decline, Nvidia is now down more than 5% in 2025. The DeepSeek developments also weighed on other AI plays, as well as stocks tied to the buildout of power providers to support this technology. Tech stocks in international markets also felt the heat on Monday. — Alex Harring The CBOE Market Volatility Index, known on Wall Street as the VIX, soared more than 45% early Monday to 21.56 — up from just 14.85 on Friday, according to FactSet data. The VIX briefly rose as high as 22.51 on Monday. The VIX is a measure of how much investors expect the S&P 500 will move over the next 30 days and is often considered a byword for how much fear there is in the stock market and where current sentiment stands. The 52-week high of 38.57 in the VIX came during August's risk-off unwinding of Japanese yen carry trades when the Bank of Japan raised rates, the dollar weakened and it briefly looked as though U.S. unemployment was picking up. — Scott Schnipper Stocks were lower across the board to kick off the new trading week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 200 points, or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 shed 1.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 3.4%. — Lisa Kailai Han These are the stocks moving the most in premarket trading: Nvidia — The artificial intelligence darling saw shares tumbling more than 11% in premarket trading, on track for its worst day since March 2020. The sell-off occurred after Chinese startup DeepSeek launched a free open-source large-language model, saying it was developed in just two months at a cost of under $6 million. Microsoft, Amazon — Other megacap stocks also sold off sharply after the news of DeepSeek stoked questions about the large amounts of money Big Tech companies have been investing in AI models and data centers. Shares of Microsoft shed 5%, while Amazon dropped by more than 4% and Meta Platforms slid by 2.5%. Constellation Energy, Vistra — Power providers for AI infrastructure were also hit hard on concerns that there would be less energy needed if DeepSeek can perform using fewer chips. Constellation Energy, Vistra, Nuscale Power and Oklo all slid at least 10% in premarket trading. Read the full list of stocks moving here. — Yun Li, Lisa Kailai Han More than 80% of stocks in the Nasdaq 100 retreated in Monday's premarket, underscoring the technology rout tied to Chinese startup DeepSeek and artificial intelligence. With all those members sliding, the tech-focused index fell more than 4%. Marvell Technology led the way down with a drop of more than 12%, while Broadcom, Constellation Energy and Nvidia each tumbled more than 11%. AI-related names sold off before the bell as concerns mounted around the potential for a stock bubble. This was catalyzed by the strong performance from DeepSeek's open-source AI model, which has raised questions about the amount of investment needed in the technology. — Alex Harring The tech-heavy Nasdaq is set to open sharply lower on Monday, but a fund tracking Chinese tech names is looking at a rally. The KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB) rose about 1% in premarket trading, building on a 3.7% gain from Friday. The top holdings in the fund include Tencent, Alibaba and Trip.com. There doesn't appear to be any direct link between major Chinese tech stocks and the new DeepSeek AI model. The move could be partly a catch-up trade, as KWEB has been a long-term underperformer of U.S. tech funds. — Jesse Pound Travel + Leisure Co. will be a winner as travel demand accelerates, according to Bank of America. The firm double-upgraded its rating on shares of the membership and leisure travel company to buy from underperform. It also hiked its price target to $60 per share from $40. A more resilient leisure travel backdrop in 2025, as well as a lower rate environment, will benefit Travel + Leisure, according to analyst Dany Asad. "We now think TNL is best positioned to deliver peer-leading double-digit EPS growth in 2025. TNL's inventory spend is limited, putting free cash flow conversion ahead of peers and enabling aggressive stock buy backs," Asad wrote in a Monday note. — Hakyung Kim Nvidia shares dropped 11% to lead a major tech sell-off after Chinese startup DeepSeek raised concerns over the U.S.' competitiveness in AI. Fellow chipmakers Micron and AMD lost 8.6% and 5.5%, respectively. Megacap tech names Amazon and Meta fell about 5% each, while Microsoft pulled back by 6%. — Fred Imbert, Jenni Reid Europe's regional Stoxx 600 index was 0.69% lower at 8:30 a.m. London time, with Germany's DAX index falling 1.2%. Technology was the worst-performing sector, down 4%, as artificial intelligence firms retreated around the world on concerns over competition from China's DeepSeek. Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory deVere Group, said DeepSeek's newly launched AI model had been reported to be more cost-effective while running on less advanced chips than tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. "Deepseek is going to challenge Silicon Valley's leadership, disrupting the global tech landscape and reshaping the direction of the AI arms race," Green said in emailed comments. "The launch of this innovation underscores a historic pivot in the balance of technological power." — Jenni Reid Roughly 90 S&P 500 companies are due to post their latest quarterly figures. Here's your earnings calendar for the week: Read here for CNBC Pro's breakdown of some key reports. — Pia Singh Stock futures opened lower ahead of a busy earnings week and key inflation data. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 124 points, or 0.3%. S&P futures shed 0.5%, while Nasdaq 100 futures slid 194 points, or nearly 0.9%. — Pia Singh Got a confidential news tip?

Title: LIMETA 10000mAh Dual 18W (36W) USB-C Power bank $13.93 + delivery ($0 Prime/$59+) @ Li-meta via Amazon

can also claim free 100W 2m USB-C cable by adding both items from the How to claim Free benefit gift area in green under the price. Warning: I clicked through once and the green text link disappeared when I refreshed/went back to the item page. so be careful seems to be limited to click once per account. even after clearing cookies and refreshing Free gift page link is gone for me. all time low for this small capacity power bank. cheaper than the recent $19 Anko 10000mAh (which tbf had built in cables but only did 15W). and $1.20 more than the cheapest $12.74 INIU 10000mAh (but tbf the LIMETA goes 18W single port and 36W dual port compared to INIU’s 15W). this cheaper LIMETA page looks identical to the other listing, but this one has been on sale from November 2022 making it 2 year 2 month old stock compared to 1 year 3 month old stock of the $20 one which has been posted before (you can claim free cable on this one too). fyi guys because this is older stock of the same model: I might have missed it but could not find any marketing mentioning the 80% charge limit by app function that’s on the $20 one. (possible only when charging power bank at 18W with one port). the exact same looking $20 LIMETA is also known to use high quality Samsung batteries inside, I don’t know if it is true of this older stock $13 one. (regular power banks won’t use Samsung batteries anyway, but some people like hearing that) also do not plug two chargers into any power bank. this is a feature unique to this LIMETA power bank. This one has the ability to limit charging to 80%, I am currently using the ISD Link app. Can't seem to find an official Limeta app on android. ISDT and Limeta are the same company or closely related. I used apkpure to download the Android version of the app. thanks. 👍 sounds like you have the $13 one and you tested so 80% charge limit works on it. Nice - that is cheap - I paid the full original price (nearly $30) over a year ago - it's been a great powerbank Yep got the cable for free nice. yeah weird for me even logged out I can’t see the Benefit link under the price anymore. I had the Benefit page in my browser history before so I could have technically still got it. but worth knowing you can lose the link easily. Ok found it. $13 model is PB40 $20 is EB40 Not sure whats the differences are but $13 model also shows EB40 in many areas. $20 page says Model No. EB40, Part No. PB40. so my conclusion was same model, just old stock or V1 version? a lot of the function also the exact same. https://www.isdt.co/pb40.html?lang=en I think juat different brand. Not sure.. but im not savvy enough to break open the $13 later lol Sold out Oh c…crap! That was quick Tried adding it to my cart and it was no longer available. Uses samsung 21700 cells, does pass through charging, has 2 independent 18w circuits. I have it hooked up to my laptop and app shows one circuit is charging the power bank at 18w and the other is charging the laptop at 22w (even when it claims 18w is max). Do not try to charge the powerbank using 2 cables from the same power brick for e.g 2x cables from a single 65W PD brick, the power bank did make some weird noises, use 2 separate power bricks and it will be fine. Does get a little hot but there is an option within the app to reduce the heat through decreasing charge/discharge strength. Got the Apple Watch charger version. It’s also on sale but with lower capacity. Also has the bonus cable. 7000mAh one right? haven't seen that one before. but I also don't have a AW. I wonder if it can charge both phone and watch at the same time if you put the phone face down->powerbank->AW on top. Here to look for fire comments… I prefer models that come with included cables, and they are slimmer. I bought one on sale for $10 a year ago. I prefer models that come with included cables you mean built in cables? yeah they can be handy especially if travelling you don't have to constantly wonder where the cable is. Yes! Get a small pouch, put cable and power bank on it. yeah but sometimes you will separate the two. maybe you are at someone elses place and they already have a charger, so you take out and just use the cable. maybe you just plug it into car, plane or cafe USB-C port. maybe you are in a rush and only have time to shove it in your bag where it gets buried under everything else. it's worse for clumsy forgetful people like me so I would be happy to know the cable can't come off the power bank. I don't plan on travelling any time soon so I don't need one yet but I thought built in cable would be handy when you really depend on the power bank to charge. @n3ck3ntry8bort0rgasm: Mine arrived, it says eb40 on the box. So tiny!!! @CyberMurning: yeah so I think my comment above checks out, it is the same model as $20 one, just older production/version stock. as you also said “$20 model is EB40”. $20 one still in stock guys. link at bottom of deal post.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg's $65 Billion AI Bet Benefits Nvidia And Other Players, Says Top Analyst, But Warns Market Bull Run Will 'End In A Spectacular Bubble Burst'

Deepwater Asset Management’s Gene Munster says Meta Platform Inc.’s META plans to invest up to $65 billion this year to expand its AI infrastructure will benefit Nvidia Corp. NVDA and other hardware players. What Happened: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Friday outlined the company’s capital spending plans for 2025 and its focus on artificial intelligence (AI). Don’t Miss: Zuckerberg expects Meta to allocate between $60 billion and $65 billion for capital spending, primarily aimed at expanding the company's AI teams and building a new data center. he described the new data center as being “so large that it would cover a significant part of Manhattan.” The tech mogul further noted that Meta aims to bring a gigawatt of computing power online by 2025 and is projected to finish the year with over 1.3 million graphics processing units. Weighing in on the announcement, Munster said Meta’s commitment “exceeds Street estimates of $51B.” "In 2025, I expect Meta AI will be the leading assistant serving more than 1 billion people, Llama 4 will become the leading state of the art model, and we'll build an AI engineer that will start contributing increasing amounts of code to our R&D efforts," Zuckerberg said. See Also: Nancy Pelosi Invested $5 Million In An AI Company Last Year — Here's How You Can Invest In Multiple Pre-IPO AI Startups With Just $1,000 According to Munster, the increased investment in AI infrastructure will particularly benefit Nvidia and other hardware players in the short term. In the long term, the higher capital expenditure (Capex) is expected to accelerate the AI flywheel, leading to more innovation, lower usage costs, an increase in customers, and consequently, more investment. He also issued a reminder, stating, “I believe the market is going higher and the run will end in a spectacular bubble burst.” The latest datapoint that the AI trade remains intact. Zuckerberg's comment that $META will spend $60–$65B in Capex for 2025 exceeds Street estimates of $51B.In the near term, increased investment in AI infrastructure benefits $NVDA and other hardware players.Long term,… Why It Matters: Zuckerberg’s announcement comes on the heels of Meta’s recent AI advancements. In December, Meta introduced the Llama 3.3 70B, a new AI model that outperforms competitors like Alphabet Inc.‘s GOOGL GOOG Google, OpenAI, and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN. This model offers the performance of Meta's largest Llama model, Llama 3.1 405B, but at a reduced cost. Last year in April, Meta announced its plan to purchase 350,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs by 2024 to fuel its AI initiatives. Zuckerberg then said the 350,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs were initially intended to enhance Instagram Reels, not to position Meta as a leader in AI technology. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump criticized the European Union (EU) for focusing on U.S. tech giants like Meta, Apple, and Google. He accused EU regulators of unfairly targeting these companies, calling their actions “a form of taxation.” Price Action: Meta Platform’s stock closed at $647.49 on Friday, down 0.20% for the day, according to Benzinga Pro data.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Deepwater Asset Management’s Gene Munster says Meta Platform Inc.’s (NASDAQ:META) plans to invest up to $65 billion this year to expand its AI infrastructure will benefit Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and other hardware players. What Happened: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Friday outlined the company’s capital spending plans for 2025 and its focus on artificial intelligence (AI). Don’t Miss: Elon Musk Told The U.N. If They Could Show A Plan For Ending World Hunger He'd Donate $6 Billion – ‘I Will Sell Tesla Stock Right Now And Do It' Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target – Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share! Zuckerberg expects Meta to allocate between $60 billion and $65 billion for capital spending, primarily aimed at expanding the company's AI teams and building a new data center. he described the new data center as being “so large that it would cover a significant part of Manhattan.” The tech mogul further noted that Meta aims to bring a gigawatt of computing power online by 2025 and is projected to finish the year with over 1.3 million graphics processing units. Weighing in on the announcement, Munster said Meta’s commitment “exceeds Street estimates of $51B.” "In 2025, I expect Meta AI will be the leading assistant serving more than 1 billion people, Llama 4 will become the leading state of the art model, and we'll build an AI engineer that will start contributing increasing amounts of code to our R&D efforts," Zuckerberg said. See Also: Nancy Pelosi Invested $5 Million In An AI Company Last Year — Here's How You Can Invest In Multiple Pre-IPO AI Startups With Just $1,000 According to Munster, the increased investment in AI infrastructure will particularly benefit Nvidia and other hardware players in the short term. In the long term, the higher capital expenditure (Capex) is expected to accelerate the AI flywheel, leading to more innovation, lower usage costs, an increase in customers, and consequently, more investment. He also issued a reminder, stating, “I believe the market is going higher and the run will end in a spectacular bubble burst.” Why It Matters: Zuckerberg’s announcement comes on the heels of Meta’s recent AI advancements. In December, Meta introduced the Llama 3.3 70B, a new AI model that outperforms competitors like Alphabet Inc.‘s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google, OpenAI, and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). This model offers the performance of Meta's largest Llama model, Llama 3.1 405B, but at a reduced cost. Last year in April, Meta announced its plan to purchase 350,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs by 2024 to fuel its AI initiatives. Zuckerberg then said the 350,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs were initially intended to enhance Instagram Reels, not to position Meta as a leader in AI technology. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump criticized the European Union (EU) for focusing on U.S. tech giants like Meta, Apple, and Google. He accused EU regulators of unfairly targeting these companies, calling their actions “a form of taxation.” Price Action: Meta Platform’s stock closed at $647.49 on Friday, down 0.20% for the day, according to Benzinga Pro data.

Restaurant stocks. While hot tech and social media stocks like Amazon and Meta Platforms continue to make new highs, there is one sector failing to keep up: restaurant stocks. Some of these names — like McDonalds — used to be considered must-owns for portfolio managers looking to outperform the averages. Judging by these price charts, those days may be over. Arcos Dorados Holdings (Nasdaq: ARCO): Arcos Dorados Holdings daily price chart, 1 25 25. The price in mid-December dropped below the mid-September support where the red-dotted line is placed. The 50-day moving average in May crossed below the 200-day moving average. The stock briefly rallied off of the late year low but remains below both of those moving averages. Arcos Dorados trades with a price-earnings ratio of 10.57 and at 3 times its book value. The debt-to-equity ratio is 3.35. This year’s earnings are off by 26%. Over the past five years, EPS shows growth of 37%. The company pays a 3.41% dividend. McDonalds (NYSE: MCD): McDonalds daily price chart, 1 25 25. The price in mid-January dipped below the 200-day moving average and has since rallied a bit, although it remains below a down-trending 50-day moving average. That dip down broke below the November low, a previous level of buying support, indicated by the red-dotted line. The company, one of the most recognized brand names in the world, has a market cap of $204 billion. It trades with a price-earnings ratio of 25. Earnings this year are off by 1.36% and up over the past five years by 8.93%. McDonald’s pays a dividend of 2.37%. Restaurant Brands International (NYSE: QSR): Restaurant Brands International daily price chart, 1 25 25. The price in early January broke below the previous support level from late May of $54. The stock has rallied off of the mid-month low of $50 and the buying volume looks strong. The 50-day moving average in early June crossed below the 200-day moving average and it’s never gone back above it. Restaurant Brands includes the franchises Burger King, Tim Hortons, Popeyes and Firehouse Subs. Market cap is $20.10 billion. The price-earnings ratio is 15. The debt-to-equity ratio is on the high side at 4.94. The company offers investors a 3.75% dividend. Wendy’s (Nasdaq: WEN): Wendy's daily price chart, 1 25 25. Last week’s new low takes the price well below the July low, the previous level of buying support. The stock participated in the post-election rally and then began a steady descent in value. The 50-day moving average in mid-January crossed below the 200-day moving average, a clear signal of weakness. Market capitalization is $2.91 billion. The price-earnings ratio is 15. The debt-to-equity ratio is a steep 15. This year’s earnings are up by 2.85%. EPS growth over the past five years is 10%. The short float of 6.56% indicates a greater interest among short sellers than the other similar brands listed here. Yum Brands (NYSE: YUM): Yum Brands daily price chart, 1 25 25. The mid-January low briefly took the price below the late July low. The stock found buyers at $122 and rallied back to just above $129. The 50-day moving average last week crossed below the 200-day moving average. Yum Brands operates more than 59,000 restaurants in over 150 countries and territories, according to the company website. Market cap is $35.79 billion. The price-earnings ratio is 23.99. Earnings this year are up by 5.87% and up over the past five years by 3.62%. Yum pays a 2.08% dividend. Stats courtesy of FinViz.com.

Title: The impact of competition and DeepSeek on Nvidia

Time Published: 2025-01-25T15:30:25Z

Jeffrey Emanuel January 25, 2025 60 min read As someone who spent ~10 years working as a generalist investment analyst at various long/short hedge funds (including stints at Millennium and Balyasny), while also being something of a math and computer nerd who has been studying deep learning since 2010 (back when Geoff Hinton was still talking about Restricted Boltzmann Machines and everything was still programmed using MATLAB, and researchers were still trying to show that they could get better results at classifying handwritten digits than by using Support Vector Machines), I'd like to think that I have a fairly unusual perspective on how AI technology is developing and how this relates to equity valuations in the stock market. For the past few years, I have been working more as a developer, and have several popular open-source projects for working with various forms of AI models/services (e.g., see LLM Aided OCR, Swiss Army Llama, Fast Vector Similarity, Source to Prompt, and Pastel Inference Layer for a few recent examples). Basically, I am using these frontier models all day, every day, in about as intense a way as possible. I have 3 Claude accounts so I don't run out of requests, and signed up for ChatGPT Pro within minutes of it being available. I also try to keep on top of the latest research advances, and carefully read all the major technical report papers that come out from the major AI labs. So I think I have a pretty good read on the space and how things are developing. At the same time, I've shorted a ton of stocks in my life and have won the best idea prize on the Value Investors Club twice (for TMS long and PDH short if you're keeping track at home). I say this not to brag, but rather to help establish my bona fides as someone who could opine on the subject without coming across as hopelessly naive to either technologists or professional investors. And while there are surely many people who know the math/science better, and people who are better at long/short investing in the stock market than me, I doubt there are very many who are in the middle of the Venn diagram to the extent I can claim to be. With all that said, whenever I meet with and chat with my friends and ex colleagues from the hedge fund world, the conversation quickly turns to Nvidia. It's not every day that a company goes from relative obscurity to being worth more than the combined stock markets of England, France, or Germany! And naturally, these friends want to know my thoughts on the subject. Because I am such a dyed-in-the-wool believer in the long term transformative impact of this technology— I truly believe it's going to radically change nearly every aspect of our economy and society in the next 5-10 years, with basically no historical precedent— it has been hard for me to make the argument that Nvidia's momentum is going to slow down or stop anytime soon. But even though I've thought the valuation was just too rich for my blood for the past year or so, a confluence of recent developments has caused me to flip a bit to my usual instinct, which is to be a bit more contrarian in outlook and to question the consensus when it seems to be more than priced in. The saying "what the wise man believes in the beginning, the fool believes in the end" became famous for a good reason. Before we get into the developments that give me pause, let's pause to briefly review the bull case for NVDA shares, which is basically now known by everyone and his brother. Deep learning and AI are the most transformative technologies since the internet, and poised to change basically everything in our society. Nvidia has somehow ended up with something close to a monopoly in terms of the share of aggregate industry capex that is spent on training and inference infrastructure. Some of the largest and most profitable companies in the world, like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Google, Oracle, etc., have all decided that they must do and spend whatever it takes to stay competitive in this space because they simply cannot afford to be left behind. The amount of capex dollars, gigawatts of electricity used, square footage of new-build data centers, and, of course, the number of GPUs, has absolutely exploded and seems to show no sign of slowing down. And Nvidia is able to earn insanely high 90%+ gross margins on the most high-end, datacenter oriented products. We've just scratched the surface here of the bull case. There are many additional aspects to it now, which have made even people who were already very bullish to become incrementally more bullish. Besides things like the rise of humanoid robots, which I suspect is going to take most people by surprise when they are rapidly able to perform a huge number of tasks that currently require an unskilled (or even skilled) human worker (e.g., doing laundry, cleaning, organizing, and cooking; doing construction work like renovating a bathroom or building a house in a team of workers; running a warehouse and driving forklifts, etc.), there are other factors which most people haven't even considered. One major thing that you hear the smart crowd talking about is the rise of "a new scaling law," which has created a new paradigm thinking about how compute needs will increase over time. The original scaling law, which is what has been driving progress in AI since AlexNet appeared in 2012 and the Transformer architecture was invented in 2017, is the pre-training scaling law: that the more billions (and now trillions) worth of tokens we can use as training data, and the larger the parameter count of the models we are training, and the more FLOPS of compute that we expend on training those models on those tokens, the better the performance of the resulting models on a large variety of highly useful downstream tasks. Not only that, but this improvement is somewhat knowable, to the point where the leading AI labs like OpenAI and Anthropic have a pretty good idea of just how good their latest models would be even before they started the actual training runs— in some cases, predicting the benchmarks of the final models to within a couple percentage points. This "original scaling law" has been vitally important, but always caused some doubts in the minds of people projecting the future with it. For one thing, we seem to have already exhausted the world's accumulated set of high quality training data. Of course, that's not literally true— there are still so many old books and periodicals that haven't yet been properly digitized, and even if they have, are not properly licensed for use as training data. The problem is that, even if you give credit for all that stuff— say the sum total of "professionally" produced English language written content from the year 1500 to, say, the year 2000, it's not such a tremendous amount in percentage terms when you're talking about a training corpus of nearly 15 trillion tokens, which is the scale of current frontier models. For a quick reality check of those numbers: Google Books has digitized around 40mm books so far; if a typical book has 50k to 100k words, or 65k to 130k tokens, then that's between 2.6T and 5.2T tokens just from books, though surely a large chunk of that is already included in the training corpora used by the big labs, whether it's strictly legal or not. And there are lots of academic papers, with the arXiv website alone having over 2mm papers. And the Library of Congress has over 3 billion digitized newspaper pages. Taken together, that could be as much as 7T tokens in total, but since much of this is in fact included in training corpora, the remaining "incremental" training data probably isn't all that significant in the grand scheme of things. Of course, there are other ways to gather more training data. You could automatically transcribe every single YouTube video for example, and use that text. And while that might be helpful on the margin, it's certainly of much lower quality than, say, a highly respected textbook on Organic Chemistry as a source of useful knowledge about the world. So we've always had a looming "data wall" when it comes to the original scaling law; although we know we can keep shoveling more and more capex into GPUs and building more and more data centers, it's a lot harder to mass produce useful new human knowledge which is correct and incremental to what is already out there. Now, one intriguing response to this has been the rise of "synthetic data," which is text that is itself the output of an LLM. And while this seems almost nonsensical that it would work to "get high on your own supply" as a way of improving model quality, it actually seems to work very well in practice, at least in the domain of math, logic, and computer programming. The reason, of course, is that these are areas where we can mechanically check and prove the correctness of things. So we can sample from the vast universe of possible math theorems or possible Python scripts, and then actually check if they are correct, and only include them in our corpus if they are. And in this way, we can very dramatically expand our collection of high quality training data, at least in these kinds of areas. And then there are all the other kinds of data we could be training AI on besides text. For example, what if we take the entire whole genome sequencing (around 200 GB to 300 GB uncompressed for a single human being) for 100 million people? That's a lot of data obviously, although the vast majority of it would be nearly identical between any two people. Of course, this could be misleading to compare to textual data from books and the internet for various reasons: But it's still another large source of diverse information that we could train huge models on in the future, which is why I included it. So while there is some hope in terms of being able to capture more and more additional training data, if you look at the rate at which training corpora have grown in recent years, it quickly becomes obvious that we are close to hitting a wall in terms of data availability for "generally useful" knowledge that can get us closer to the ultimate goal of getting artificial super-intelligence which is 10x smarter than John von Neumann and is an absolute world-class expert on every specialty known to man. Besides the limited amount of available data, there have always been a couple other things that have lurked in the back of the mind of proponents of the pre-training scaling law. A big one of these is, after you've finished training the model, what are you supposed to do with all that compute infrastructure? Train the next model? Sure, you can do that, but given the rapid improvement in GPU speed and capacity, and the importance of electricity and other opex in the economic calculations, does it even really make sense to use your 2 year old cluster to train your new model? Surely you'd rather use the brand new data center you just built that costs 10x the old data center and is 20x more powerful because of better technology. The problem is, at some point you do need to amortize the up-front cost of these investments and recoup it with a stream of (hopefully positive) operating profit, right? The market is so excited about AI that it has thankfully ignored this, allowing companies like OpenAI to post breathtaking from-inception, cumulative operating losses while garnering increasingly eye-popping valuations in follow-up investment rounds (although, to their credit, they have also been able to demonstrate very fast growing revenues). But eventually, for this situation to be sustainable over a full market cycle, these data center costs do need to eventually be recouped, hopefully with a profit, which over time is competitive with other investment opportunities on a risk-adjusted basis. OK, so that was the pre-training scaling law. What's this "new" scaling law? Well, that's something that people really just started focusing on in the past year: inference time compute scaling. Before, the vast majority of all the compute you'd expend in the process was the up-front training compute to create the model in the first place. Once you had the trained model, performing inference on that model— i.e., asking a question or having the LLM perform some kind of task for you— used a certain, limited amount of compute. Critically, the total amount of inference compute (measured in various ways, such as FLOPS, in GPU memory footprint, etc.) was much, much less than what was required for the pre-training phase. Of course, the amount of inference compute does flex up when you increase the context window size of the models and the amount of output that you generate from them in one go (although researchers have made breathtaking algorithmic improvements on this front relative to the initial quadratic scaling people originally expected in scaling this up). But essentially, until recently, inference compute was generally a lot less intensive than training compute, and scaled basically linearly with the number of requests you are handling— the more demand for text completions from ChatGPT, for instance, the more inference compute you used up. With the advent of the revolutionary Chain-of-Thought ("COT") models introduced in the past year, most noticeably in OpenAI's flagship O1 model (but very recently in DeepSeek's new R1 model, which we will talk about later in much more detail), all that changed. Instead of the amount of inference compute being directly proportional to the length of the output text generated by the model (scaling up for larger context windows, model size, etc.), these new COT models also generate intermediate "logic tokens"; think of this as a sort of scratchpad or "internal monologue" of the model while it's trying to solve your problem or complete its assigned task. This represents a true sea change in how inference compute works: now, the more tokens you use for this internal chain of thought process, the better the quality of the final output you can provide the user. In effect, it's like giving a human worker more time and resources to accomplish a task, so they can double and triple check their work, do the same basic task in multiple different ways and verify that they come out the same way; take the result they came up with and "plug it in" to the formula to check that it actually does solve the equation, etc. It turns out that this approach works almost amazingly well; it is essentially leveraging the long anticipated power of what is called "reinforcement learning" with the power of the Transformer architecture. It directly addresses the single biggest weakness of the otherwise phenomenally successful Transformer model, which is its propensity to "hallucinate". Basically, the way Transformers work in terms of predicting the next token at each step is that, if they start out on a bad "path" in their initial response, they become almost like a prevaricating child who tries to spin a yarn about why they are actually correct, even if they should have realized mid-stream using common sense that what they are saying couldn't possibly be correct. Because the models are always seeking to be internally consistent and to have each successive generated token flow naturally from the preceding tokens and context, it's very hard for them to course-correct and backtrack. By breaking the inference process into what is effectively many intermediate stages, they can try lots of different things and see what's working and keep trying to course-correct and try other approaches until they can reach a fairly high threshold of confidence that they aren't talking nonsense. Perhaps the most extraordinary thing about this approach, beyond the fact that it works at all, is that the more logic/COT tokens you use, the better it works. Suddenly, you now have an additional dial you can turn so that, as you increase the amount of COT reasoning tokens (which uses a lot more inference compute, both in terms of FLOPS and memory), the higher the probability is that you will give a correct response— code that runs the first time without errors, or a solution to a logic problem without an obviously wrong deductive step. I can tell you from a lot of firsthand experience that, as good as Anthropic's Claude3.5 Sonnet model is at Python programming— and it is indeed VERY good— whenever you need to generate anything long and complicated, it invariably ends up making one or more stupid mistakes. Now, these mistakes are usually pretty easy to fix, and in fact you can normally fix them by simply feeding the errors generated by the Python interpreter, without any further explanation, as a follow-up inference prompt (or, more usefully, paste in the complete set of detected "problems" found in the code by your code editor, using what something called a Linter), it was still an annoying additional step. And when the code becomes very long or very complicated, it can sometimes take a lot longer to fix, and might even require some manual debugging by hand. The first time I tried the O1 model from OpenAI was like a revelation: I was amazed how often the code would be perfect the very first time. And that's because the COT process automatically finds and fixes problems before they ever make it to a final response token in the answer the model gives you. In fact, the O1 model used in OpenAI's ChatGPT Plus subscription for $20/month is basically the same model as the one used in the O1-Pro model featured in their new ChatGPT Pro subscription for 10x the price ($200/month, which raised plenty of eyebrows in the developer community); the main difference is that O1-Pro thinks for a lot longer before responding, generating vastly more COT logic tokens, and consuming a far larger amount of inference compute for every response. This is quite striking in that, even a very long and complex prompt for Claude3.5 Sonnet or GPT4o, with ~400kb+ of context given, generally takes less than 10 seconds to begin responding, and often less than 5 seconds. Whereas that same prompt to O1-Pro could easily take 5+ MINUTES before you get a response (although OpenAI does show you some of the "reasoning steps" that are generated during the process while you wait; critically, OpenAI has decided, presumably for trade secret related reasons,to hide from you the exact reasoning tokens it generates, showing you instead a highly abbreviated summary of these). As you can probably imagine, there are tons of contexts where accuracy is paramount— where you'd rather give up and tell the user you can't do it at all rather than give an answer that could be trivially proven wrong or which involves hallucinated facts or otherwise specious reasoning. Anything involving money/transactions, medical stuff, legal stuff, just to name a few. Basically, wherever the cost of inference is trivial relative to the hourly all-in compensation of the human knowledge worker who is interacting with the AI system, that's a case where it become a complete no-brainer to dial up the COT compute (the major drawback is that it increases the latency of responses by a lot, so there are still some contexts where you might prefer to iterate faster by getting lower latency responses that are less accurate or correct). Some of the most exciting news in the AI world came out just a few weeks ago and concerned OpenAI's new unreleased O3 model, which was able to solve a large variety of tasks that were previously deemed to be out of reach of current AI approaches in the near term. And the way it was able to do these hardest problems (which include exceptionally tough "foundational" math problems that would be very hard for even highly skilled professional mathematicians to solve), is that OpenAI threw insane amount of compute resources at the problems— in some cases, spending $3k+ worth of compute power to solve a single task (compare this to traditional inference costs for a single task, which would be unlikely to exceed a couple dollars using regular Transformer models without chain-of-thought). It doesn't take an AI genius to realize that this development creates a new scaling law that is totally independent of the original pre-training scaling law. Now, you still want to train the best model you can by cleverly leveraging as much compute as you can and as many trillion tokens of high quality training data as possible, but that's just the beginning of the story in this new world; now, you could easily use incredibly huge amounts of compute just to do inference from these models at a very high level of confidence or when trying to solve extremely tough problems that require "genius level" reasoning to avoid all the potential pitfalls that would lead a regular LLM astray. Even if you believe, as I do, that the future prospects for AI are almost unimaginably bright, the question still remains, "Why should one company extract the majority of the profit pool from this technology?" There are certainly many historical cases where a very important new technology changed the world, but the main winners were not the companies that seemed the most promising during the initial stages of the process. The Wright Brothers' airplane company in all its current incarnations across many different firms today isn't worth more than $10b despite them inventing and perfecting the technology well ahead of everyone else. And while Ford has a respectable market cap of $40b today, it's just 1.1% of Nvidia's current market cap. To understand this, it's important to really understand why Nvidia is currently capturing so much of the pie today. After all, they aren't the only company that even makes GPUs. AMD makes respectable GPUs that, on paper, have comparable numbers of transistors, which are made using similar process nodes, etc. Sure, they aren't as fast or as advanced as Nvidia's GPUs, but it's not like the Nvidia GPUs are 10x faster or anything like that. In fact, in terms of naive/raw dollars per FLOP, AMD GPUs are something like half the price of Nvidia GPUs. Looking at other semiconductor markets such as the DRAM market, despite the fact that it is also very highly consolidated with only 3 meaningful global players (Samsung, Micron, SK-Hynix), gross margins in the DRAM market range from negative at the bottom of the cycle to ~60% at the very top of the cycle, with an average in the 20% range. Compare that to Nvidia's overall gross margin in recent quarters of ~75%, which is dragged down by the lower-margin and more commoditized consumer 3D graphics category. So how is this possible? Well, the main reasons have to do with software— better drivers that "just work" on Linux and which are highly battle-tested and reliable (unlike AMD, which is notorious for the low quality and instability of their Linux drivers), and highly optimized open-source code in popular libraries such as PyTorch that has been tuned to work really well on Nvidia GPUs. It goes beyond that though— the very programming framework that coders use to write low-level code that is optimized for GPUs, CUDA, is totally proprietary to Nvidia, and it has become a de facto standard. If you want to hire a bunch of extremely talented programmers who know how to make things go really fast on GPUs, and pay them $650k/year or whatever the going rate is for people with that particular expertise, chances are that they are going to "think" and work in CUDA. Besides software superiority, the other major thing that Nvidia has going for it is what is known as interconnect— essentially, the bandwidth that connects together thousands of GPUs together efficiently so they can be jointly harnessed to train today's leading-edge foundational models. In short, the key to efficient training is to keep all the GPUs as fully utilized as possible all the time— not waiting around idling until they receive the next chunk of data they need to compute the next step of the training process. The bandwidth requirements are extremely high— much, much higher than the typical bandwidth that is needed in traditional data center use cases. You can't really use traditional networking gear or fiber optics for this kind of interconnect, since it would introduce too much latency and wouldn't give you the pure terabytes per second of bandwidth that is needed to keep all the GPUs constantly busy. Nvidia made an incredibly smart decision to purchase the Israeli company Mellanox back in 2019 for a mere $6.9b, and this acquisition is what provided them with their industry leading interconnect technology. Note that interconnect speed is a lot more relevant to the training process, where you have to harness together the output of thousands of GPUs at the same time, than the inference process (including COT inference), which can use just a handful of GPUs— all you need is enough VRAM to store the quantized (compressed) model weights of the already-trained model. So those are arguably the major components of Nvidia's "moat" and how it has been able to maintain such high margins for so long (there is also a "flywheel" aspect to things, where they aggressively invest their super-normal profits into tons of R&D, which in turn helps them improve their tech at a faster rate than the competition, so they are always in the lead in terms of raw performance). But as was pointed out earlier, what customers really tend to care about, all other things being equal, is performance per dollar (both in up-front capex cost of equipment and in energy usage, so performance per watt), and even though Nvidia's GPUs are certainly the fastest, they are not the best price/performance when measured naively in terms of FLOPS. But the thing is, all other things are NOT equal, and the fact that AMD's drivers suck, that popular AI software libraries don't run as well on AMD GPUs, that you can't find really good GPU experts who specialize in AMD GPUs outside of the gaming world (why would they bother when there is more demand in the market for CUDA experts?), that you can't wire thousands of them together as effectively because of lousy interconnect technology for AMD— all this means that AMD is basically not competitive in the high-end data center world, and doesn't seem to have very good prospects for getting there in the near term. Well, that all sounds very bullish for Nvidia, right? Now you can see why the stock is trading at such a huge valuation! But what are the other clouds on the horizon? Well, there are few that I think merit significant attention. Some have been lurking in the background for the last few years, but too small to make a dent considering how quickly the pie has been growing, but where they are getting ready to potentially inflect upwards. Others are very recent developments (as in, the last 2 weeks) that might dramatically change the near-term trajectory of incremental GPU demand. At a very high level, you can think of things like this: Nvidia operated in a pretty niche area for a very long time; they had very limited competition, and the competition wasn't particular profitable or growing fast enough to ever pose a real threat, since they didn't have the capital needed to really apply pressure to a market leader like Nvidia. The gaming market was large and growing, but didn't feature earth shattering margins or particularly fabulous year over year growth rates. A few big tech companies started ramping up hiring and spending on machine learning and AI efforts around 2016-2017, but it was never a truly significant line item for any of them on an aggregate basis— more of a "moonshot" R&D expenditure. But once the big AI race started in earnest with the release of ChatGPT in 2022— only a bit over 2 years ago, although it seems like a lifetime ago in terms of developments— that situation changed very dramatically. Suddenly, big companies were ready to spend many, many billions of dollars incredibly quickly. The number of researchers showing up at the big research conferences like Neurips and ICML went up very, very dramatically. All the smart students who might have previously studied financial derivatives were instead studying Transformers, and $1mm+ compensation packages for non-executive engineering roles (i.e., for independent contributors not managing a team) became the norm at the leading AI labs. It takes a while to change the direction of a massive cruise ship; and even if you move really quickly and spend billions, it takes a year or more to build greenfield data centers and order all the equipment (with ballooning lead times) and get it all set up and working. It takes a long time to hire and onboard even smart coders before they can really hit their stride and familiarize themselves with the existing codebases and infrastructure. But now, you can imagine that absolutely biblical amounts of capital, brainpower, and effort are being expended in this area. And Nvidia has the biggest target of any player on their back, because they are the ones who are making the lion's share of the profits TODAY, not in some hypothetical future where the AI runs our whole lives. So the very high level takeaway is basically that "markets find a way"; they find alternative, radically innovative new approaches to building hardware that leverage completely new ideas to sidestep barriers that help prop up Nvidia's moat. For example, so-called "wafer scale" AI training chips from Cerebras, which dedicate an entire 300mm silicon wafer to an absolutely gargantuan chip that contains orders of magnitude more transistors and cores on a single chip (see this recent blog post from them explaining how they were able to solve the "yield problem" that had been preventing this approach from being economically practical in the past). To put this into perspective, if you compare Cerebras' newest WSE-3 chip to Nvidia's flagship data-center GPU, the H100, the Cerebras chip has a total die area of 46,225 square millimeters compared to just 814 for the H100 (and the H100 is itself considered an enormous chip by industry standards); that's a multiple of ~57x! And instead of having 132 "streaming multiprocessor" cores enabled on the chip like the H100 has, the Cerebras chip has ~900,000 cores (granted, each of these cores is smaller and does a lot less, but it's still an almost unfathomably large number in comparison). In more concrete apples-to-apples terms, the Cerebras chip can do around ~32x the FLOPS in AI contexts as a single H100 chip. Since an H100 sells for close to $40k a pop, you can imagine that the WSE-3 chip isn't cheap. So why does this all matter? Well, instead of trying to battle Nvidia head-on by using a similar approach and trying to match the Mellanox interconnect technology, Cerebras has used a radically innovative approach to do an end-run around the interconnect problem: inter-processor bandwidth becomes much less of an issue when everything is running on the same super-sized chip. You don't even need to have the same level of interconnect because one mega chip replaces tons of H100s. And the Cerebras chips also work extremely well for AI inference tasks. In fact, you can try it today for free here and use Meta's very respectable Llama-3.3-70B model. It responds basically instantaneously, at ~1,500 tokens per second. To put that into perspective, anything above 30 tokens per second feels relatively snappy to users based on comparisons to ChatGPT and Claude, and even 10 tokens per second is fast enough that you can basically read the response while it's being generated. Cerebras is also not alone; there are other companies, like Groq (not to be confused with the Grok model family trained by Elon Musk's X AI). Groq has taken yet another innovative approach to solving the same fundamental problem. Instead of trying to compete with Nvidia's CUDA software stack directly, they've developed what they call a "tensor processing unit" (TPU) that is specifically designed for the exact mathematical operations that deep learning models need to perform. Their chips are designed around a concept called "deterministic compute," which means that, unlike traditional GPUs where the exact timing of operations can vary, their chips execute operations in a completely predictable way every single time. This might sound like a minor technical detail, but it actually makes a massive difference for both chip design and software development. Because the timing is completely deterministic, Groq can optimize their chips in ways that would be impossible with traditional GPU architectures. As a result, they've been demonstrating for the past 6+ months inference speeds of over 500 tokens per second with the Llama series of models and other open source models, far exceeding what's possible with traditional GPU setups. Like Cerebras, this is available today and you can try it for free here. Using a comparable Llama3 model with "speculative decoding," Groq is able to generate 1,320 tokens per second, on par with Cerebras and far in excess of what is possible using regular GPUs. Now, you might ask what the point is of achieving 1,000+ tokens per second when users seem pretty satisfied with ChatGPT, which is operating at less than 10% of that speed. And the thing is, it does matter. It makes it a lot faster to iterate and not lose focus as a human knowledge worker when you get instant feedback. And if you're using the model programmatically via the API, which is increasingly where much of the demand is coming from, then it can enable whole new classes of applications that require multi-stage inference (where the output of previous stages is used as input in successive stages of prompting/inference) or which require low-latency responses, such as content moderation, fraud detection, dynamic pricing, etc. But even more fundamentally, the faster you can serve requests, the faster you can cycle things, and the busier you can keep the hardware. Although Groq's hardware is extremely expensive, clocking in at $2mm to $3mm for a single server, it ends up costing far less per request fulfilled if you have enough demand to keep the hardware busy all the time. And like Nvidia with CUDA, a huge part of Groq's advantage comes from their own proprietary software stack. They are able to take the same open source models that other companies like Meta, DeepSeek, and Mistral develop and release for free, and decompose them in special ways that allow them to run dramatically faster on their specific hardware. Like Cerebras, they have taken different technical decisions to optimize certain particular aspects of the process, which allows them to do things in a fundamentally different way. In Groq's case, it's because they are entirely focused on inference level compute, not on training: all their special sauce hardware and software only give these huge speed and efficiency advantages when doing inference on an already trained model. But if the next big scaling law that people are excited about is for inference level compute— and if the biggest drawback of COT models is the high latency introduced by having to generate all those intermediate logic tokens before they can respond— then even a company that only does inference compute, but which does it dramatically faster and more efficiently than Nvidia can— can introduce a serious competitive threat in the coming years. At the very least, Cerebras and Groq can chip away at the lofty expectations for Nvidia's revenue growth over the next 2-3 years that are embedded in the current equity valuation. Besides these particularly innovative, if relatively unknown, startup competitors, there is some serious competition coming from some of Nvidia's biggest customers themselves who have been making custom silicon that specifically targets AI training and inference workloads. Perhaps the best known of these is Google, which has been developing its own proprietary TPUs since 2016. Interestingly, although it briefly sold TPUs to external customers, Google has been using all its TPUs internally for the past several years, and it is already on its 6th generation of TPU hardware. Amazon has also been developing its own custom chips called Trainium2 and Inferentia2. And while Amazon is building out data centers featuring billions of dollars of Nvidia GPUs, they are also at the same time investing many billions in other data centers that use these internal chips. They have one cluster that they are bringing online for Anthropic that features over 400k chips. Amazon gets a lot of flak for totally bungling their internal AI model development, squandering massive amounts of internal compute resources on models that ultimately are not competitive, but the custom silicon is another matter. Again, they don't necessarily need their chips to be better and faster than Nvidia's. What they need is for their chips to be good enough, but build them at a breakeven gross margin instead of the ~90%+ gross margin that Nvidia earns on its H100 business. OpenAI has also announced their plans to build custom chips, and they (together with Microsoft) are obviously the single largest user of Nvidia's data center hardware. As if that weren't enough, Microsoft have themselves announced their own custom chips! And Apple, the most valuable technology company in the world, has been blowing away expectations for years now with their highly innovative and disruptive custom silicon operation, which now completely trounces the CPUs from both Intel and AMD in terms of performance per watt, which is the most important factor in mobile (phone/tablet/laptop) applications. And they have been making their own internally designed GPUs and "Neural Processors" for years, even though they have yet to really demonstrate the utility of such chips outside of their own custom applications, like the advanced software based image processing used in the iPhone's camera. While Apple's focus seems somewhat orthogonal to these other players in terms of its mobile-first, consumer oriented, "edge compute" focus, if it ends up spending enough money on its new contract with OpenAI to provide AI services to iPhone users, you have to imagine that they have teams looking into making their own custom silicon for inference/training (although given their secrecy, you might never even know about it directly!). Now, it's no secret that there is a strong power law distribution of Nvidia's hyper-scaler customer base, with the top handful of customers representing the lion's share of high-margin revenue. How should one think about the future of this business when literally every single one of these VIP customers is building their own custom chips specifically for AI training and inference? When thinking about all this, you should keep one incredibly important thing in mind: Nvidia is largely an IP based company. They don't make their own chips. The true special sauce for making these incredible devices arguably comes more from TSMC, the actual fab, and ASML, which makes the special EUV lithography machines used by TSMC to make these leading-edge process node chips. And that's critically important, because TSMC will sell their most advanced chips to anyone who comes to them with enough up-front investment and is willing to guarantee a certain amount of volume. They don't care if it's for Bitcoin mining ASICs, GPUs, TPUs, mobile phone SoCs, etc. As much as senior chip designers at Nvidia earn per year, surely some of the best of them could be lured away by these other tech behemoths for enough cash and stock. And once they have a team and resources, they can design innovative chips (again, perhaps not even 50% as advanced as an H100, but with that Nvidia gross margin, there is plenty of room to work with) in 2 to 3 years, and thanks for TSMC, they can turn those into actual silicon using the exact same process node technology as Nvidia. As if these looming hardware threats weren't bad enough, there are a few developments in the software world in the last couple years that, while they started out slowly, are now picking up real steam and could pose a serious threat to the software dominance of Nvidia's CUDA. The first of these is the horrible Linux drivers for AMD GPUs. Remember we talked about how AMD has inexplicably allowed these drivers to suck for years despite leaving massive amounts of money on the table? Well, amusingly enough, the infamous hacker George Hotz (famous for jailbreaking the original iphone as a teenager, and currently the CEO of self-driving startup Comma.ai and AI computer company Tiny Corp, which also makes the open-source tinygrad AI software framework), recently announced that he was sick and tired of dealing with AMD's bad drivers, and desperately wanted to be able to to leverage the lower cost AMD GPUs in their TinyBox AI computers (which come in multiple flavors, some of which use Nvidia GPUs, and some of which use AMD GPUS). Well, he is making his own custom drivers and software stack for AMD GPUs without any help from AMD themselves; on Jan. 15th of 2025, he tweeted via his company's X account that "We are one piece away from a completely sovereign stack on AMD, the RDNA3 assembler. We have our own driver, runtime, libraries, and emulator. (all in ~12,000 lines!)" Given his track record and skills, it is likely that they will have this all working in the next couple months, and this would allow for a lot of exciting possibilities of using AMD GPUs for all sorts of applications where companies currently feel compelled to pay up for Nvidia GPUs. OK, well that's just a driver for AMD, and it's not even done yet. What else is there? Well, there are a few other areas on the software side that are a lot more impactful. For one, there is now a massive concerted effort across many large tech companies and the open source software community at large to make more generic AI software frameworks that have CUDA as just one of many "compilation targets". That is, you write your software using higher-level abstractions, and the system itself can automatically turn those high-level constructs into super well-tuned low-level code that works extremely well on CUDA. But because it's done at this higher level of abstraction, it can just as easily get compiled into low-level code that works extremely well on lots of other GPUs and TPUs from a variety of providers, such as the massive number of custom chips in the pipeline from every big tech company. The most famous examples of these frameworks are MLX (sponsored primarily by Apple), Triton (sponsored primarily by OpenAI), and JAX (developed by Google). MLX is particularly interesting because it provides a PyTorch-like API that can run efficiently on Apple Silicon, showing how these abstraction layers can enable AI workloads to run on completely different architectures. Triton, meanwhile, has become increasingly popular as it allows developers to write high-performance code that can be compiled to run on various hardware targets without having to understand the low-level details of each platform. These frameworks allow developers to write their code once using high powered abstractions and then target tons of platforms automatically— doesn't that sound like a better way to do things, which would give you a lot more flexibility in terms of how you actually run the code? In the 1980s, all the most popular, best selling software was written in hand-tuned assembly language. The PKZIP compression utility for example was hand crafted to maximize speed, to the point where a competently coded version written in the standard C programming language and compiled using the best available optimizing compilers at the time, would run at probably half the speed of the hand-tuned assembly code. The same is true for other popular software packages like WordStar, VisiCalc, and so on. Over time, compilers kept getting better and better, and every time the CPU architectures changed (say, from Intel releasing the 486, then the Pentium, and so on), that hand-rolled assembler would often have to be thrown out and rewritten, something that only the smartest coders were capable of (sort of like how CUDA experts are on a different level in the job market versus a "regular" software developer). Eventually, things converged so that the speed benefits of hand-rolled assembly were outweighed dramatically by the flexibility of being able to write code in a high-level language like C or C++, where you rely on the compiler to make things run really optimally on the given CPU. Nowadays, very little new code is written in assembly. I believe a similar transformation will end up happening for AI training and inference code, for similar reasons: computers are good at optimization, and flexibility and speed of development is increasingly the more important factor— especially if it also allows you to save dramatically on your hardware bill because you don't need to keep paying the "CUDA tax" that gives Nvidia 90%+ margins. Yet another area where you might see things change dramatically is that CUDA might very well end up being more of a high level abstraction itself— a "specification language" similar to Verilog (used as the industry standard to describe chip layouts) that skilled developers can use to describe high-level algorithms that involve massive parallelism (since they are already familiar with it, it's very well constructed, it's the lingua franca, etc.), but then instead of having that code compiled for use on Nvidia GPUs like you would normally do, it can instead be fed as source code into an LLM which can port it into whatever low-level code is understood by the new Cerebras chip, or the new Amazon Trainium2, or the new Google TPUv6, etc. This isn't as far off as you might think; it's probably already well within reach using OpenAI's latest O3 model, and surely will be possible generally within a year or two. Perhaps the most shocking development which was alluded to earlier happened in the last couple of weeks. And that is the news that has totally rocked the AI world, and which has been dominating the discourse among knowledgeable people on Twitter despite its complete absence from any of the mainstream media outlets: that a small Chinese startup called DeepSeek released two new models that have basically world-competitive performance levels on par with the best models from OpenAI and Anthropic (blowing past the Meta Llama3 models and other smaller open source model players such as Mistral). These models are called DeepSeek-V3 (basically their answer to GPT-4o and Claude3.5 Sonnet) and DeepSeek-R1 (basically their answer to OpenAI's O1 model). Why is this all so shocking? Well, first of all, DeepSeek is a tiny Chinese company that reportedly has under 200 employees. The story goes that they started out as a quant trading hedge fund similar to TwoSigma or RenTec, but after Xi Jinping cracked down on that space, they used their math and engineering chops to pivot into AI research. Who knows if any of that is really true or if they are merely some kind of front for the CCP or the Chinese military. But the fact remains that they have released two incredibly detailed technical reports, for DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeekR1. These are heavy technical reports, and if you don't know a lot of linear algebra, you probably won't understand much. But what you should really try is to download the free DeepSeek app on the AppStore here and install it using a Google account to log in and give it a try (you can also install it on Android here), or simply try it out on your desktop computer in the browser here. Make sure to select the "DeepThink" option to enable chain-of-thought (the R1 model) and ask it to explain parts of the technical reports in simple terms. This will simultaneously show you a few important things: One, this model is absolutely legit. There is a lot of BS that goes on with AI benchmarks, which are routinely gamed so that models appear to perform great on the benchmarks but then suck in real world tests. Google is certainly the worst offender in this regard, constantly crowing about how amazing their LLMs are, when they are so awful in any real world test that they can't even reliably accomplish the simplest possible tasks, let alone challenging coding tasks. These DeepSeek models are not like that— the responses are coherent, compelling, and absolutely on the same level as those from OpenAI and Anthropic. Two, that DeepSeek has made profound advancements not just in model quality, but more importantly in model training and inference efficiency. By being extremely close to the hardware and by layering together a handful of distinct, very clever optimizations, DeepSeek was able to train these incredible models using GPUs in a dramatically more efficient way. By some measurements, over ~45x more efficiently than other leading-edge models. DeepSeek claims that the complete cost to train DeepSeek-V3 was just over $5mm. That is absolutely nothing by the standards of OpenAI, Anthropic, etc., which were well into the $100mm+ level for training costs for a single model as early as 2024. How in the world could this be possible? How could this little Chinese company completely upstage all the smartest minds at our leading AI labs, which have 100 times more resources, headcount, payroll, capital, GPUs, etc? Wasn't China supposed to be crippled by Biden's restriction on GPU exports? Well, the details are fairly technical, but we can at least describe them at a high level. It might have just turned out that the relative GPU processing poverty of DeepSeek was the critical ingredient to make them more creative and clever, necessity being the mother of invention and all. A major innovation is their sophisticated mixed-precision training framework that lets them use 8-bit floating point numbers (FP8) throughout the entire training process. Most Western AI labs train using "full precision" 32-bit numbers (this basically specifies the number of gradations possible in describing the output of an artificial neuron; 8 bits in FP8 lets you store a much wider range of numbers than you might expect— it's not just limited to 256 different equal-sized magnitudes like you'd get with regular integers, but instead uses clever math tricks to store both very small and very large numbers— though naturally with less precision than you'd get with 32 bits.) The main tradeoff is that while FP32 can store numbers with incredible precision across an enormous range, FP8 sacrifices some of that precision to save memory and boost performance, while still maintaining enough accuracy for many AI workloads. DeepSeek cracked this problem by developing a clever system that breaks numbers into small tiles for activations and blocks for weights, and strategically uses high-precision calculations at key points in the network. Unlike other labs that train in high precision and then compress later (losing some quality in the process), DeepSeek's native FP8 approach means they get the massive memory savings without compromising performance. When you're training across thousands of GPUs, this dramatic reduction in memory requirements per GPU translates into needing far fewer GPUs overall. Another major breakthrough is their multi-token prediction system. Most Transformer based LLM models do inference by predicting the next token— one token at a time. DeepSeek figured out how to predict multiple tokens while maintaining the quality you'd get from single-token prediction. Their approach achieves about 85-90% accuracy on these additional token predictions, which effectively doubles inference speed without sacrificing much quality. The clever part is they maintain the complete causal chain of predictions, so the model isn't just guessing— it's making structured, contextual predictions. One of their most innovative developments is what they call Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA). This is a breakthrough in how they handle what are called the Key-Value indices, which are basically how individual tokens are represented in the attention mechanism within the Transformer architecture. Although this is getting a bit too advanced in technical terms, suffice it to say that these KV indices are some of the major uses of VRAM during the training and inference process, and part of the reason why you need to use thousands of GPUs at the same time to train these models— each GPU has a maximum of 96 gb of VRAM, and these indices eat that memory up for breakfast. Their MLA system finds a way to store a compressed version of these indices that captures the essential information while using far less memory. The brilliant part is this compression is built directly into how the model learns— it's not some separate step they need to do, it's built directly into the end-to-end training pipeline. This means that the entire mechanism is "differentiable" and able to be trained directly using the standard optimizers. All this stuff works because these models are ultimately finding much lower-dimensional representations of the underlying data than the so-called "ambient dimensions". So it's wasteful to store the full KV indices, even though that is basically what everyone else does. Not only do you end up wasting tons of space by storing way more numbers than you need, which gives a massive boost to the training memory footprint and efficiency (again, slashing the number of GPUs you need to train a world class model), but it can actually end up improving model quality because it can act like a "regularizer," forcing the model to pay attention to the truly important stuff instead of using the wasted capacity to fit to noise in the training data. So not only do you save a ton of memory, but the model might even perform better. At the very least, you don't get a massive hit to performance in exchange for the huge memory savings, which is generally the kind of tradeoff you are faced with in AI training. They also made major advances in GPU communication efficiency through their DualPipe algorithm and custom communication kernels. This system intelligently overlaps computation and communication, carefully balancing GPU resources between these tasks. They only need about 20 of their GPUs' streaming multiprocessors (SMs) for communication, leaving the rest free for computation. The result is much higher GPU utilization than typical training setups achieve. Another very smart thing they did is to use what is known as a Mixture-of-Experts (MOE) Transformer architecture, but with key innovations around load balancing. As you might know, the size or capacity of an AI model is often measured in terms of the number of parameters the model contains. A parameter is just a number that stores some attribute of the model; either the "weight" or importance a particular artificial neuron has relative to another one, or the importance of a particular token depending on its context (in the "attention mechanism"), etc. Meta's latest Llama3 models come in a few sizes, for example: a 1 billion parameter version (the smallest), a 70B parameter model (the most commonly deployed one), and even a massive 405B parameter model. This largest model is of limited utility for most users because you would need to have tens of thousands of dollars worth of GPUs in your computer just to run at tolerable speeds for inference, at least if you deployed it in the naive full-precision version. Therefore most of the real-world usage and excitement surrounding these open source models is at the 8B parameter or highly quantized 70B parameter level, since that's what can fit in a consumer-grade Nvidia 4090 GPU, which you can buy now for under $1,000. So why does any of this matter? Well, in a sense, the parameter count and precision tells you something about how much raw information or data the model has stored internally. Note that I'm not talking about reasoning ability, or the model's "IQ" if you will: it turns out that models with even surprisingly modest parameter counts can show remarkable cognitive performance when it comes to solving complex logic problems, proving theorems in plane geometry, SAT math problems, etc. But those small models aren't going to be able to necessarily tell you every aspect of every plot twist in every single novel by Stendhal, whereas the really big models can potentially do that. The "cost" of that extreme level of knowledge is that the models become very unwieldy both to train and to do inference on, because you always need to store every single one of those 405B parameters (or whatever the parameter count is) in the GPU's VRAM at the same time in order to do any inference with the model. The beauty of the MOE model approach is that you can decompose the big model into a collection of smaller models that each know different, non-overlapping (at least fully) pieces of knowledge. DeepSeek's innovation here was developing what they call an "auxiliary-loss-free" load balancing strategy that maintains efficient expert utilization without the usual performance degradation that comes from load balancing. Then, depending on the nature of the inference request, you can intelligently route the inference to the "expert" models within that collection of smaller models that are most able to answer that question or solve that task. You can loosely think of it as being a committee of experts who have their own specialized knowledge domains: one might be a legal expert, the other a computer science expert, the other a business strategy expert. So if a question comes in about linear algebra, you don't give it to the legal expert. This is of course a very loose analogy and it doesn't actually work like this in practice. The real advantage of this approach is that it allows the model to contain a huge amount of knowledge without being very unwieldy, because even though the aggregate number of parameters is high across all the experts, only a small subset of these parameters is "active" at any given time, which means that you only need to store this small subset of weights in VRAM in order to do inference. In the case of DeepSeek-V3, they have an absolutely massive MOE model with 671B parameters, so it's much bigger than even the largest Llama3 model, but only 37B of these parameters are active at any given time— enough to fit in the VRAM of two consumer-grade Nvidia 4090 GPUs (under $2,000 total cost), rather than requiring one or more H100 GPUs which cost something like $40k each. It's rumored that both ChatGPT and Claude use an MoE architecture, with some leaks suggesting that GPT-4 had a total of 1.8 trillion parameters split across 8 models containing 220 billion parameters each. Despite that being a lot more doable than trying to fit all 1.8 trillion parameters in VRAM, it still requires multiple H100-grade GPUs just to run the model because of the massive amount of memory used. Beyond what has already been described, the technical papers mention several other key optimizations. These include their extremely memory-efficient training framework that avoids tensor parallelism, recomputes certain operations during backpropagation instead of storing them, and shares parameters between the main model and auxiliary prediction modules. The sum total of all these innovations, when layered together, has led to the ~45x efficiency improvement numbers that have been tossed around online, and I am perfectly willing to believe these are in the right ballpark. One very strong indicator that it's true is the cost of DeepSeek's API: despite this nearly best-in-class model performance, DeepSeek charges something like 95% less money for inference requests via its API than comparable models from OpenAI and Anthropic. In a sense, it's sort of like comparing Nvidia's GPUs to the new custom chips from competitors: even if they aren't quite as good, the value for money is so much better that it can still be a no-brainer depending on the application, as long as you can qualify the performance level and prove that it's good enough for your requirements and the API availability and latency is good enough (thus far, people have been amazed at how well DeepSeek's infrastructure has held up despite the truly incredible surge of demand owing to the performance of these new models). But unlike the case of Nvidia, where the cost differential is the result of them earning monopoly gross margins of 90%+ on their data-center products, the cost differential of the DeepSeek API relative to the OpenAI and Anthropic API could be simply that they are nearly 50x more compute efficient (it might even be significantly more than that on the inference side— the ~45x efficiency was on the training side). Indeed, it's not even clear that OpenAI and Anthropic are making great margins on their API services— they might be more interested in revenue growth and gathering more data from analyzing all the API requests they receive. Before moving on, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that many people are speculating that DeepSeek is simply lying about the number of GPUs and GPU hours spent training these models because they actually possess far more H100s than they are supposed to have given the export restrictions on these cards, and they don't want to cause trouble for themselves or hurt their chances of acquiring more of these cards. While it's certainly possible, I think it's more likely that they are telling the truth, and that they have simply been able to achieve these incredible results by being extremely clever and creative in their approach to training and inference. They explain how they are doing things, and I suspect that it's only a matter of time before their results are widely replicated and confirmed by other researchers at various other labs. The newer R1 model and technical report might even be even more mind blowing, since they were able to beat Anthropic to Chain-of-thought and now are basically the only ones besides OpenAI who have made this technology work at scale. But note that the O1 preview model was only released by OpenAI in mid-September of 2024. That's only ~4 months ago! Something you absolutely must keep in mind is that, unlike OpenAI, which is incredibly secretive about how these models really work at a low level, and won't release the actual model weights to anyone besides partners like Microsoft and other who sign heavy-duty NDAs, these DeepSeek models are both completely open-source and permissively licensed. They have released extremely detailed technical reports explaining how they work, as well as the code that anyone can look at and try to copy. With R1, DeepSeek essentially cracked one of the holy grails of AI: getting models to reason step-by-step without relying on massive supervised datasets. Their DeepSeek-R1-Zero experiment showed something remarkable: using pure reinforcement learning with carefully crafted reward functions, they managed to get models to develop sophisticated reasoning capabilities completely autonomously. This wasn't just about solving problems— the model organically learned to generate long chains of thought, self-verify its work, and allocate more computation time to harder problems. The technical breakthrough here was their novel approach to reward modeling. Rather than using complex neural reward models that can lead to "reward hacking" (where the model finds bogus ways to boost their rewards that don't actually lead to better real-world model performance), they developed a clever rule-based system that combines accuracy rewards (verifying final answers) with format rewards (encouraging structured thinking). This simpler approach turned out to be more robust and scalable than the process-based reward models that others have tried. What's particularly fascinating is that during training, they observed what they called an "aha moment," a phase where the model spontaneously learned to revise its thinking process mid-stream when encountering uncertainty. This emergent behavior wasn't explicitly programmed; it arose naturally from the interaction between the model and the reinforcement learning environment. The model would literally stop itself, flag potential issues in its reasoning, and restart with a different approach, all without being explicitly trained to do this. The full R1 model built on these insights by introducing what they call "cold-start" data— a small set of high-quality examples— before applying their RL techniques. They also solved one of the major challenges in reasoning models: language consistency. Previous attempts at chain-of-thought reasoning often resulted in models mixing languages or producing incoherent outputs. DeepSeek solved this through a clever language consistency reward during RL training, trading off a small performance hit for much more readable and consistent outputs. The results are mind-boggling: on AIME 2024, one of the most challenging high school math competitions, R1 achieved 79.8% accuracy, matching OpenAI's O1 model. On MATH-500, it hit 97.3%, and it achieved the 96.3 percentile on Codeforces programming competitions. But perhaps most impressively, they managed to distill these capabilities down to much smaller models: their 14B parameter version outperforms many models several times its size, suggesting that reasoning ability isn't just about raw parameter count but about how you train the model to process information. The recent scuttlebutt on Twitter and Blind (a corporate rumor website) is that these models caught Meta completely off guard and that they perform better than the new Llama4 models which are still being trained. Apparently, the Llama project within Meta has attracted a lot of attention internally from high-ranking technical executives, and as a result they have something like 13 individuals working on the Llama stuff who each individually earn more per year in total compensation than the combined training cost for the DeepSeek-V3 models which outperform it. How do you explain that to Zuck with a straight face? How does Zuck keep smiling while shoveling multiple billions of dollars to Nvidia to buy 100k H100s when a better model was trained using just 2k H100s for a bit over $5mm? But you better believe that Meta and every other big AI lab is taking these DeepSeek models apart, studying every word in those technical reports and every line of the open source code they released, trying desperately to integrate these same tricks and optimizations into their own training and inference pipelines. So what's the impact of all that? Well, naively it sort of seems like the aggregate demand for training and inference compute should be divided by some big number. Maybe not by 45, but maybe by 25 or even 30? Because whatever you thought you needed before these model releases, it's now a lot less. Now, an optimist might say "You are talking about a mere constant of proportionality, a single multiple. When you're dealing with an exponential growth curve, that stuff gets washed out so quickly that it doesn't end up matter all that much." And there is some truth to that: if AI really is as transformational as I expect, if the real-world utility of this tech is measured in the trillions, if inference-time compute is the new scaling law of the land, if we are going to have armies of humanoid robots running around doing massive amounts of inference constantly, then maybe the growth curve is still so steep and extreme, and Nvidia has a big enough lead, that it will still work out. But Nvidia is pricing in a LOT of good news in the coming years for that valuation to make sense, and when you start layering all these things together into a total mosaic, it starts to make me at least feel extremely uneasy about spending ~20x the 2025 estimated sales for their shares. What happens if you even see a slight moderation in sales growth? What if it turns out to be 85% instead of over 100%? What if gross margins come in a bit from 75% to 70%— still ridiculously high for a semiconductor company? At a high level, NVIDIA faces an unprecedented convergence of competitive threats that make its premium valuation increasingly difficult to justify at 20x forward sales and 75% gross margins. The company's supposed moats in hardware, software, and efficiency are all showing concerning cracks. The whole world— thousands of the smartest people on the planet, backed by untold billions of dollars of capital resources— are trying to assail them from every angle. On the hardware front, innovative architectures from Cerebras and Groq demonstrate that NVIDIA's interconnect advantage— a cornerstone of its data center dominance— can be circumvented through radical redesigns. Cerebras' wafer-scale chips and Groq's deterministic compute approach deliver compelling performance without needing NVIDIA's complex interconnect solutions. More traditionally, every major NVIDIA customer (Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Apple) is developing custom silicon that could chip away at high-margin data center revenue. These aren't experimental projects anymore— Amazon alone is building out massive infrastructure with over 400,000 custom chips for Anthropic. The software moat appears equally vulnerable. New high-level frameworks like MLX, Triton, and JAX are abstracting away CUDA's importance, while efforts to improve AMD drivers could unlock much cheaper hardware alternatives. The trend toward higher-level abstractions mirrors how assembly language gave way to C/C++, suggesting CUDA's dominance may be more temporary than assumed. Most importantly, we're seeing the emergence of LLM-powered code translation that could automatically port CUDA code to run on any hardware target, potentially eliminating one of NVIDIA's strongest lock-in effects. Perhaps most devastating is DeepSeek's recent efficiency breakthrough, achieving comparable model performance at approximately 1/45th the compute cost. This suggests the entire industry has been massively over-provisioning compute resources. Combined with the emergence of more efficient inference architectures through chain-of-thought models, the aggregate demand for compute could be significantly lower than current projections assume. The economics here are compelling: when DeepSeek can match GPT-4 level performance while charging 95% less for API calls, it suggests either NVIDIA's customers are burning cash unnecessarily or margins must come down dramatically. The fact that TSMC will manufacture competitive chips for any well-funded customer puts a natural ceiling on NVIDIA's architectural advantages. But more fundamentally, history shows that markets eventually find a way around artificial bottlenecks that generate super-normal profits. When layered together, these threats suggest NVIDIA faces a much rockier path to maintaining its current growth trajectory and margins than its valuation implies. With five distinct vectors of attack— architectural innovation, customer vertical integration, software abstraction, efficiency breakthroughs, and manufacturing democratization— the probability that at least one succeeds in meaningfully impacting NVIDIA's margins or growth rate seems high. At current valuations, the market isn't pricing in any of these risks. I hope you enjoyed reading this article.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against other top trending AI stocks on Wall Street. President Donald Trump has recently announced a private sector investment to build more AI data centers, marking yet another effort by the US government to stay ahead in the race for supremacy in artificial intelligence. A prominent player in the field has been OpenAI, the artificial intelligence startup known to have started the AI arms race in the first place. In its latest, OpenAI has recently previewed an AI agent that can carry out tasks on the web for users. This move seeks to enhance its chatbot amidst intensifying competition. READ ALSO: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings and 11 AI Stocks That Should Be On Your Watchlist Dubbed the “Operator”, the tool is powered by a model that allows it to interact with on-screen buttons, menus, and text fields. “This capability marks the next step in AI development, allowing models to use the same tools humans rely on daily and opening the door to a vast range of new applications”. OpenAI says Operator is “an agent that can go to the web to perform tasks for you”. As such, companies are increasingly using agents like these to assist in tasks and execute actions without direct human intervention. Currently available to Pro users in the US, the Operator can perform numerous tasks, such as creating to-do lists or assisting in planning vacations. The company states that it eventually plans to expand the Operator to Plus, Team, and Enterprise users and will be integrating Operator into ChatGPT. It also revealed how the tool currently faces trouble with some tasks, such as managing calendars and creating slideshows. “Operator is one of our first agents, which are AIs capable of doing work for you independently. You give it a task and it will execute it”. Based on trends in artificial intelligence, agents are the next big advancement in the AI field. Even Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang agrees that they are. Artificial Intelligence agents are autonomous intelligent systems that can perform specific tasks without human intervention. “AI agents are going to get deployed. I think this year we’re going to see it take off”. According to him, areas such as software engineering, digital marketing, and customer service are the first where AI agents can add value. As for his company, it is already using AI agents in chip design. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Title: The AI spending frenzy is just getting started

Project Stargate kicks off a fresh wave of tech CEO chest-thumping. Plus: My conversation with the CEO of Reddit. Project Stargate kicks off a fresh wave of tech CEO chest-thumping. Plus: My conversation with the CEO of Reddit. by Alex Heath “All I know is I’m good for my $80 billion.” Rarely does a one-liner so perfectly capture the state of the moment. Here, you have Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella saying he’s “not in the details” about Stargate, the supposedly multi-hundred-billion AI infrastructure project driven by his marquee investment, OpenAI. Nadella not being read in on the nebulous details of Stargate says a lot about how much Microsoft and OpenAI have drifted apart. Microsoft is mentioned in the Stargate press release since OpenAI’s models are still exclusive to Azure. But the most striking aspect of Stargate is not that the money isn’t there for it yet; it’s that OpenAI’s biggest backer has decided to not participate in what Sam Altman is calling “the most important project of this era.” As Nadella made clear on CNBC this week, he’s running his own, $80 billion AI infrastructure buildout and, going forward, OpenAI can get additional compute — with his blessing — elsewhere. While it received fewer headlines this week, I found Nadella’s response to Elon Musk on X even more illuminating. In his response to Musk saying, “on the other hand, Satya definitely does have the money,” Nadella responded: “😂 And all this money is not about hyping AI, but is about building useful things for the real world!” That post can only be interpreted as a dig at Altman. Nadella could have funded Stargate for OpenAI. He didn’t. What does he know that the rest of us don’t? The splashy Stargate unveiling at the White House certainly accomplished its goal, which was clearly getting everyone to talk about big numbers. The headlines it generated prompted Mark Zuckerberg to make sure everyone ended the week knowing his data center will be even bigger than Stargate. In a Friday post on his Facebook page, Zuckerberg said that Meta’s planned 2GW data center in Louisiana “is so large it would cover a significant part of Manhattan,” with a map view of the square footage overlaid on the city to send the point home. From his post (my emphasis added): “We’ll bring online ~1GW of compute in ‘25 and we’ll end the year with more than 1.3 million GPUs. We’re planning to invest $60-65B in capex this year while also growing our AI teams significantly, and we have the capital to continue investing in the years ahead.” I have no doubt that Altman, Masayoshi Son, and Larry Ellison will be able to raise the billions they need to lessen OpenAI’s dependence on Microsoft for compute. (The US government isn’t giving money to Stargate, which makes the optics of announcing it alongside Trump all the more bizarre.) Ultimately, this all points to the theme that is quickly coming to define 2025: Big Tech sees AI as the most existential technology of the coming era and will keep spending like hell to make sure OpenAI doesn’t completely run away with it. Few companies had as good of a 2024 as Reddit. Since going public last March, the company’s stock has soared 300 percent, giving the social network a valuation of $32 billion. It’s an about-face from where Reddit was before going public, when its moderators were raging against its hurried platform changes and there was backlash to the company selling its data to Google and OpenAI. With those controversies now seemingly in the rear-view mirror, Reddit is focused on growing its user base, staying profitable, and using AI to help people search its site more easily. I caught up with CEO Steve Huffman at CES a few weeks ago to hear his priorities for 2025, how he’s leading Reddit, his thoughts on the AI scaling debate, content moderation, and more… The following interview has been edited for length and clarity: Your IPO did very well. What have the last nine months or so been like for you personally? We have a saying at Reddit that good numbers make good meetings. So we’ve had some good meetings. Preparing to go public was intense. It’s telling the story over and over and over, which I enjoy doing, but it’s a lot of work. I think more than most new companies, we are in the public company rhythm already: close the quarter, do the audits, do the board meeting, earnings, and all of that. So it hasn’t been a major change for us from an operating point of view. It’s a really exciting time for the new investors and employees. You won’t catch us complaining. What I keep telling the company is that everyone should be very proud of the work they’ve done and don’t take these moments for granted. I just tell them, look, enjoy the view. If you look at our history, there are lots of ups and downs. No doubt there are challenges in our future. With your market cap where it is now, are you thinking of making swings you didn’t think you could make a year ago? There are two classes of things that we would do. One is to execute the core strategy. We’ve got to hire. We’ve got to build. I think we’re very reasonable in terms of our investment size. The one sentence strategy for us is to grow the product and stay profitable. What can you do with a high stock price? Maybe you can look at M&A that you wouldn’t otherwise. I’d say that’s not really our orientation right now because the acquisitions we’ve done over the last two years have been these 25-to-50-million-dollar deals. It’s kind of a sweet spot for us to get tech and teams. I’d say we’re always watching the market, but we’re not pursuing anything big or crazy right now because I like the core strategy. I think we can do what we want to do within our current capabilities. What’s the main product focus for Reddit this year? The first is the core of Reddit, which is community conversations. Everyone has a home on Reddit, but do you see that home in your first session? There’s a whole other dimension to our work, which is Reddit as an information source. Reddit has all of this incredible information. For the users who have a question that needs an answer, can we give them that answer? We just got into testing Reddit Answers. I’m finding that really helpful for searches about current events. A year from now, it’s a monetization product. It’s one of the few products where it kind of scratches every itch, so it’ll be a big focus. What do you make of this debate about whether the AI industry has run out of data? I think we’d have a different answer to that question literally every month. We want to have good relationships with other people in this space. We’re open for business. At the same time, we want to maximize the value we get out of our own data. We have not experienced conflict between the two at this point. I love the [data licensing] relationships we have — the major ones being Google and OpenAI. At this point, we don’t need to make any particular partnership. I’d say they’re all nice to have but nothing is existential for us. One of the challenges is that the AI companies don’t know what product they’re building. It’s not a bad thing. They are iterating themselves. ChatGPT itself, the central product in this conversation, was a demo. Then, a year later, it’s the most important piece of enterprise technology on Earth with questionable economics. That makes it very exciting. I don’t think any of these companies would be offended to hear me say that. You were one of the first social media CEOs I saw to be very critical of TikTok. How does a US ban affect Reddit? If you look at Reddit’s traffic graph over the last 19 years, you will not see the rise and fall of any particular platform. I think every content type should work on Reddit. Video on Reddit is largely camera-out — what I’m looking at — as opposed to camera-in, or who am I? That’s social media. I think the ban is the right thing to do for reasons I’ve mentioned that honestly have nothing to do with competition. With Meta’s moderation changes, the broader conversation around social media feels like it’s changing right now. For the last 10 years, people have been talking about whether speech is the problem, which is a crazy thought. You can’t have freedom without speech. I think that detour through questioning and relitigating core values of America, hopefully that era is coming to a close. Are people playing politics? Of course, people always are. On the topic of moderation, we always just try to do things the right way, which, not coincidentally, are aligned with American values. It’s a Democratic platform. We believe very much in the power of people and the wisdom of crowds and voting processes. That is Reddit. So I’m glad to see a return to where we have been most of my life, which is an appreciation for free speech.

Investors should not to make any major moves, he advised. "Look it's a sheer hell week. Our heads will be spinning, swivel-like, lazy Susan even, as each day you can expect a flood of earnings and a sound bite from President Trump that upsets whatever order there might be," he said. "Like I always say, don't try to make decisions during this part of earnings season, just listen." On Monday, Cramer will review earnings from SoFi and AT&T. Cramer said he expects good numbers from the fintech company, even as the stock has been heavily shorted. AT&T should also do well, he added, judging by decent results from its peer Verizon. Tuesday brings a report from General Motors. Cramer said the company is likely to deliver solid results, the stock may decline because the market is focused on Tesla when it comes to the auto industry. Starbucks also reports on Tuesday, and Cramer said he's optimistic about new CEO Brian Niccol's vision for the coffee chain. Niccol was able to transform Chipotle, and Cramer said Starbucks could be worth buying after the CEO lays out his plan. Wednesday is packed. The Fed will reveal its latest decision on interest rates. Cramer said he doesn't expect a cut when employment seems so strong. T-Mobile and ServiceNow will report their fourth quarter earnings. Cramer anticipates T-Mobile heading higher, while ServiceNow might be a buy if it dips after the release. Tech behemoths Microsoft and Meta are also reporting, and Cramer called both companies' quarters wild cards. Plus, there's Tesla earnings. Cramer noted that even when it missed last quarter, the stock still climbed, so he recommended owning it. Caterpillar reports on Thursday, and Cramer said the company has managed to lean into secular growth instead of just cyclicality. Apple also reports on Thursday. Cramer acknowledged that Wall Street is expecting a miss, but he said it's still a good stock to own long term. He believes the company will be able to fix any problems it might currently be facing. Intel is set to release earnings as well. Cramer said it needs to raise cash and fix its balance sheet before investors should own the stock. Finally, Friday has reports from Chevron and Exxon Mobil. Cramer said he doesn't want to own the oil giants because they might ramp up drilling now that President Donald Trump has relaxed federal regulations. The Labor Department will also release the personal consumption expenditures price index, an important inflation metric for the Fed, on Friday. "I think it won't be cool enough. Too much spending for that to happen," Cramer said. Click here to download Jim Cramer's Guide to Investing at no cost to help you build long-term wealth and invest smarter.

This story incorporates reporting from Business Insider, TheStreet on MSN.com and Investor’s Business Daily on MSN.com.Analysts have updated their outlooks on Meta Platforms stock following an announcement from CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasizing the company’s intensified focus on artificial intelligence. Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion maintained a Buy rating for Meta, holding firm on a $670 price target. Champion’s position reflects confidence in Meta’s strategic direction, emphasizing the company’s capital investments in AI technologies. The announcement underscores Meta’s ambition to position AI centrally in its growth strategy, particularly with the development of Meta AI — a virtual assistant expected to engage over a billion users. Bank of America Securities has also expressed optimism, assigning a Buy rating with a higher $710 price target. This reflects recognition of Meta’s potential for scaling AI applications within social media and digital advertising — a sector in which Meta has already established a dominant presence. Meta, previously known as Facebook, continues to explore new technologies, with AI at the forefront of these efforts. The strategic focus on AI by Zuckerberg is poised to potentially influence investor sentiment and may further enhance Meta’s competitive edge. Quartz Intelligence Newsroom uses generative artificial intelligence to report on business trends. This is the first phase of an experimental new version of reporting.

Title: Apple enlists veteran software executive Kim Vorrath to help fix AI and Siri

Update font size. Reset Apple is enlisting a seasoned professional to tackle its AI challenges. Kim Vorrath, who has spent 36 years with the company, is moving to the AI and machine learning division. Her new role will concentrate on enhancing Siri and other AI initiatives under the supervision of AI head John Giannandrea. Vorrath has been instrumental in the development of several of Apple’s major products, from managing the initial iPhone software to supervising the operating systems for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Her most recent project involved software development for the Vision Pro spatial computing headset. Mark Gurman for Bloomberg News: ‎ The move helps bolster a team that’s racing to make Apple a leader in AI — an area where it’s fallen behind technology peers. The company has struggled to match the capabilities of OpenAI, Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. And its Apple Intelligence platform has suffered from a slow and bumpy rollout. The Siri digital assistant, groundbreaking when it was unveiled in 2011, has come to symbolize Apple’s shortcomings in AI. Upstarts like OpenAI have created their own, more versatile chatbots, and smartphone rival Samsung Electronics Co. has been faster to weave artificial intelligence features into its software. Amazon.com Inc. also is adapting its Alexa platform for the AI world. Vorrath joins the new team from Apple’s hardware engineering division, where she helped launch the Vision Pro headset… The move signals that AI is now more important than the Vision Pro, which launched in February 2024, and is seen as the biggest challenge within the company, according to a longtime Apple executive who asked not to be identified… It has been clear for some time now that Giannandrea needs additional help managing an AI group with growing prominence, according to the executive. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: At this point, sigh, we’ll just wish good luck to Vorrath and review: Apple pays and has been paying John Giannandrea, Senior Vice President of Machine Learning and AI Strategy, millions upon millions of dollars for years. WTF of any import does he really do? WTF of any import has he really delivered? Have you used Siri lately? Yup, it’s still a steaming pile of dogshit. Where’s Apple’s generative AI, John? “Too hard; too late; look for partners; gimme my paycheck and stock options.” AAPL shareholders need to start asking real questions of these executives, especially those who are supposed in charge of Apple’s “AI Strategy,” when the company clearly has none. How about some accountability for once? – MacDailyNews, March 18, 2024 Note: Apple’s (virtual, of course) 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders is scheduled for February 25, 2025 at 8:00 am P.T. Apple was caught flat-footed, due to a lack of vision on the part of leadership… So, the only solution is to partner with a [Google, OpenAI, Baidu, etc.] for the real GenAI stuff while pretending (marketing) really hard that some on-device AI Apple has whipped up in a few months is “insanely great Apple innovation” that’s at the heart of Apple’s 2024’s AI announcements when it’s really just an adjunct… Watch Apple make a big show of its on-device AI at WWDC and run many ads touting it from June onwards. Apple hopes to buy time for the data center buildouts and investments that will be required for them to someday own their own AI technology and not have to license it from the likes of [Google, OpenAI, Baidu, etc.]. This is what happens after a decade plus with a caretaker CEO at the helm after he hits the last page of his iteration playbook, yet attempts to stay in the game for too long. – MacDailyNews, April 1, 2024 Clearly, Apple is not as innovative as it was under Steve Jobs who even started the company’s work on Apple Silicon, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision Pro, but, thanks to Jobs and Cook’s subsequent management of iterations of products and services conceived during Jobs’ tenure, including the retail store buildout which is responsible for a significant portion of Apple’s growth, the company now has more than enough money to make up for Cook’s lack of vision. – MacDailyNews, April 23, 2024 The new “AI features” for iOS, iPadOS, and MacOS to be revealed at WWDC is mainly a marketing exercise. The pressure is on Apple’s marketing team to position the company as an innovator in the space (“only Apple does so much on-device AI which enhances users’ privacy to ‘stunning’ effect,” etc.) that also makes “smart partnerships” with other AI companies (OpenAI, for example; even though it’s currently forced to partner if they want to offer any real GenAI features). Now, more than ever, finding themselves so far behind, Apple needs to sell, sell, sell! – MacDailyNews, May 28, 2024 When you’re caught flat-footed like Tim Cook’s Apple, you pop into scramble mode to try to catch up. Early on, you hit it with a big marketing flourish (WWDC24) in order to buy some more time. Then you dribble out features as they get finished and actually exist. Classic vaporware. – MadDailyNews, July 31, 2024 MacDailyNews, September 10, 2024: ‎ Executing a vaporware strategy is an unfortunate necessity without a visionary CEO and it takes time to actually realize (code, test, build out datacenter infrastructure, etc.) a grand marketing vision. You know, some people get upset when we point out that Tim Cook is a boring, reactive caretaker who’s not really the best person to be running Apple today or for at least the past several years. Operations manager Cook should have been a 3-5 year stopgap after Steve Jobs’ untimely passing, running the iteration playbook, providing continuity for the company while it found a real CEO. Instead, he hung on — and keeps hanging on — well past his sell-by date. Sigh. You can be upset with us for having the temerity to call it like we see it, but the fact remains that Apple would be doing significantly better today with a visionary who’d have seen AI on the horizon, who’d have recognized the intrinsic importance of Siri and therefore invested in it instead of criminally neglecting it, and who wouldn’t have squandered the company’s gigantic leads in things like personal assistants and podcasting. – MacDailyNews, August 22, 2024 Larger displays on iPhone 16 Pro models, and hundreds of millions of iPhones that are 4+ years old, will do the heavy lifting for iPhone sales and iPhone’s average selling price (ASP). Until it gets another visionary leader (fingers crossed; Apple’s history has shown – cough, Sculley, Spindler, cough – that the next CEO could be far, far worse than the very competent caretaker Cook), Apple can afford to miss things like generative AI – which they clearly did – and then use its huge war chest to catch up – which they’re doing right now (fun times and 80-hour weeks inside Apple Park!) – and, hopefully, [someday] surpass rivals (or at least be as good). Apple will very likely unveil their catch-up work within months (this June at WWDC 2024) in iPhones (and iPads, Apple Watches, etc.) with built-in on-device generative AI and other new AI-driven features. – MacDailyNews, February 14, 2024 Apple needed new blood years ago, but the old blood simply won’t let go. – MacDailyNews, January 22, 2025 We are currently about 1/4th of the way to being sustainable with Substack subscriptions.

It’s obvious, Tim Cook prioritizes shareholder delight over customer delight and as long as he’s delivering on shareholder value, shareholders won’t question anything. They only care about milking Apple for what it’s worth. The Board is no different. And this is sad, actually. Apple Intelligence and Siri are utterly useless.. .Damn shame how pathetic it is.. At least 50% of the time I can’t even get “stupid ass” (SIRI) to call someone… It just glows.. Cook needs to go.. Sometimes I wonder if Rim Cock and the other Apple execs even use Siri. Do they have any idea? Can’t believe the comments here…lots of ingrates. I can only imagine…none of you know how good the emojis are? They make me a fulfilled human being. Thank you Tim. I don’t care if you’re not a product guy. Women never solve anything. This is just DEI. So Apple Intelligence was all spin, no substance after all? In my use it is better than old Siri bit not dramatically so. The things i’ve always used it for are more reliable. There are still things though that should be automatic (the age of some prominent politician for example) but still aren’t. It feels like Apple is erring on the side of extreme caution rather than risk mistakes like with the News summaries controversy. The question is whether we’ll see dramatic improvement this year. My guess yes but at the same time behind the competition. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Meta Will Spend Record $60 Billion On AI This Year, Zuckerberg Says—After Trump Announces Stargate Deal With OpenAI

Meta will rapidly ramp up its spending in 2025 as part of its artificial intelligence push, according to its centibillionaire CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Friday, as the battle between Meta and its generative AI competitors including OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI comes to the forefront this week with President Donald Trump’s announcement of the $500 billion “Stargate” joint venture with OpenAI. Mark Zuckerberg, center, at Trump's inauguration. “This will be a defining year for AI,” Zuckerberg said on the company’s Threads social media site, continuing with updates and predictions for Meta’s AI push in 2025. Perhaps Zuckerberg’s biggest revelation Friday was his guidance for $60 billion to $65 billion in capital expenditures for Meta in 2025. That’s well above consensus analyst forecasts of $51 billion in capital expenditures this year, according to FactSet, and Zuckerberg’s median projected capex of $62.5 billion would be 63% above Meta’s $38.4 billion in projected 2024 capex and 129% above its $27.3 billion in 2023 capex. Meta will expand its “AI teams significantly” as part of its increased spending, declared Zuckerberg. The billionaire also predicted Meta’s Llama 4 large-language model “will become the leading state of the art” AI model and it will end 2025 with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, the highly coveted Nvidia-designed processors powering generative AI programs including Meta AI, xAI’s Grok and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. After initially declining about 1% premarket following Zuckerberg’s announcement, shares of Meta rallied Friday, advancing as much as 1.6% shortly after market open before settling into a 0.9% gain by midmorning. Meta stock scored a record intraday share price of $646.90 and all-time high market value of more than $1.6 trillion. Meta shares are up more than 8% year-to-date. Zuckerberg’s 2025 outlook comes during a whirlwind week for generative AI after Trump capped his first full day in office announcing a $500 billion joint venture designed to build out the data center infrastructure to power OpenAI’s technology. Stargate was considered a win for OpenAI in its battle against the likes of xAI, Meta and Amazon-backed Anthropic to build out the best artificial general intelligence model, and the project highlighted a very public feud between Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman as Trump’s close ally Musk apparently undercut the president. Meta’s push beyond social media dates back to its 2021 name change from Facebook to Meta. Wall Street initially revolted at the company’s billions of dollars in advanced tech research, as Meta stock crashed 64% in 2022, before improving financial performance and a broader investor rush into all things AI bolstered the stock’s turnaround. Since Trump won a second term in November, Zuckerberg has overseen a major culture shift at his company, ending its fact checking and diversity, equity and exclusion (DEI) programs as Zuckerberg decried the company’s culture as losing its “masculine energy.” Meta remains an advertising company on paper, with 98% of revenue in its most recent quarter coming from social media ads. Zuckerberg is the fourth-richest person in the world with a $222 billion net worth, trailing only fellow American technology moguls in Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Amazon chairman Jeff Bezos and Oracle chairman Larry Ellison. Zuckerberg owns about 13% of Meta, a stake worth about $200 billion. Meta will report financial results from 2024’s fourth quarter Wednesday afternoon. Consensus estimates call for $6.75 earnings per share and $47 billion in revenue, which would both be quarterly records. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Meta Will Spend Up to $65 Billion to Fuel AI Expansion, Mark Zuckerberg Says

The Facebook and Instagram boss reveals plans to build a data center that is nearly as big as Manhattan to fuel its AI growth Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Friday said his company will spend $60-$65 billion this year as it looks to “significantly” expand its artificial intelligence team and services. The investment comes as Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is battling tech stalwarts like Google and Microsoft and upstart powerhouses like OpenAI for an upper hand in the budding AI industry. Most of Meta’s investment will go towards data centers — including one so big it would cover a large chunk of Manhattan — to fuel products like Llama, the AI model powering the company’s AI. He did not mention where that data center will be. “This will be a defining year for AI,” Zuckerberg said in a post on Facebook. “I expect Meta AI will be the leading assistant serving more than 1 billion people, Llama 4 will become the leading state of the art model, and we’ll build an AI engineer that will start contributing increasing amounts of code to our research and development efforts.” He added that this “massive effort” will “bring online approximately 1 [gigawatt] of compute in ’25 and we’ll end the year with more than 1.3 million [graphic processing units].” The $60-$65 billion in capital expenditures is a major increase from 2024, when the company spent about $40 billion. Meta’s investors did not seem upset by the AI investment, at least initially, with the company’s stock price increasing 0.7% in early Friday morning trading. The company is worth $1.62 trillion. Friday’s announcement comes after Zuckerberg joined a number of other tech CEOs, including OpenAI chief Sam Altman and Tesla boss Elon Musk, at President Donald Trump’s inauguration on Monday. Zuckerberg, in his Facebook post, said AI will be a central facet of Meta’s business moving forward. “Over the coming years, [AI] will drive our core products and business, unlock historic innovation and extend American technology leadership,” he wrote, before adding “Let’s go build!” and a flexing arm emoji.
