Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, India’s largest telecom operator by market share, has no immediate plans to increase mobile phone tariffs, belying market expectations, choosing instead to grow revenue by driving users to consume more data. Jio and its closest rival Bharti Airtel Ltd recently removed their entry-level plans to bump up their average revenue per user (or Arpu, a key performance metric for telecom operators), triggering expectations that the telecom operators would increase tariffs towards the end of the year or in early 2026. “We are nudging consumers to consume more and happily pay more, but no immediate plans for the tariff (hike)," said Anshuman Thakur, head of strategy at Reliance Jio Infocomm, during an earnings call with analysts. In the September quarter, Jio’s monthly average revenue per user rose 1.2% to ₹211.4 from ₹208.8 at the end of June, with growth slowing due to promotional 5G offers, according to the company. Following Jio’s decision to remove its entry-level pack, analysts had expected it to both raise tariffs and focus on premium services to close the gap with Bharti Airtel, which leads the industry in terms of Arpu ( ₹250 at the end of June). Airtel is yet to declare its September-quarter earnings. “If Reliance were not to increase tariffs in the next few months, its [year-on-year] Arpu growth for the March quarter would likely be 4% (at say ₹214/subscriber)," J.P. Morgan analysts said in a note dated 19 October. “Investors continue to expect Jio to raise telecom tariffs ahead of the proposed IPO of Reliance Jio (likely by June 2026)." Jio net added 8.3 million mobile subscribers during the September quarter, taking its subscriber base to 506.4 million. At the end of September, Jio had 234 million 5G subscribers, up from 213 million in the preceding June quarter. 5G now accounts for 50% of Jio’s total wireless traffic. Leading tariff hikesWhen telecom operators raised tariffs in July 2024 after a gap of over two years, it was Reliance Jio that took the lead with a 12–25% price hike. But while Airtel and Vodafone Idea Ltd have been vocal about the need to hike tariffs to increase the return on capital employed (RoCE, a measure of profitability and efficiency), Jio has refrained from openly talking about increasing tariffs. “We (the industry) are operating with the lowest Arpus and the lowest rate per gigabyte. Yet you have to make money," Bharti Airtel’s managing director and vice chairman Gopal Vittal said at an industry event earlier this month, adding that there was room for raising telecom tariffs. In fact, Vittal had earlier called for a change in the telecom tariff structure, by reducing data allowances on some telecom packs and charging for more data. “Though RIL (Reliance Industries) is non-committal on possible tariff hike, management indicated they have other levers like unlimited 5G slab increase, etc., to drive Arpu growth along with the accelerated roll out of FTTH (fiber-to-the-home)/FWA (fixed wireless access)," Antique Stock Broking analysts said in a note dated 19 October. Also Read | Jio Platforms IPO could see another tariff war—to hike telecom rates Jio’s broadband focusJio, during its earnings call last week, said it was looking to add more home broadband subscribers faster. It added more than 1 million new homes each month during the July-September quarter, taking its total fixed broadband connections to 23 million. Jio has set a target of 100 million home broadband customers, with no specified timeline. “The rate for connecting new homes has been increasing and the technology is working well," Thakur told analysts during the call. “A lot of these new connections are being done wirelessly, and therefore the implementation itself is simpler, faster, and we are expecting that we will be able to scale this up quite significantly from where we are today." Jio is leveraging its unlicensed band radio technology—the 5G Air Fibre and fiber route—to provide home broadband internet.

On the role of Jio’s parent, Jio Platforms Ltd, in this arrangement, Thakur said, “Jio is going to develop its own products and it is going to work with Reliance Intelligence to bring its solutions to the market." Jio Platforms houses the telecom and digital services business of Reliance Industries. Reliance Jio Infocomm is a subsidiary of Jio Platforms, accounting for most of its business. Reliance Intelligence will develop and invest in creating AI products, Thakur explained, adding that this would require a lot of infrastructure and computing needs such as graphic processing units (GPUs).

While Jio will have an open slate to work with companies such as OpenAI, Meta and Google, Reliance Intelligence will compete with these global tech giants, he said. “This dual structure—RI (Reliance Intelligence) developing core AI capabilities and Jio leveraging them across its platforms—ensures lower incremental investment needs, stronger integration, and long-term cost efficiency, positioning Reliance to monetize enterprise AI workloads and India- specific digital services in the coming years," the Antique Stock Broking analysts said in their note. Jio Platforms reported a 12.8% year-on-year growth in net profit to ₹7,375 crore for the September quarter. Revenue from operations rose 14.6% to ₹36,332 crore.

Title: This Wall Street Firm Says Alphabet Stock Is A Better Bet Than Meta. Here's Why.

You don't necessarily have to choose between the stocks of two Big Tech giants—but if you must, Oppenheimer has a pick for you. Shares of both Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (META), owner of Facebook and Instagram, have been strong performers this year, outpacing the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) and the S&P 500. Still, Oppenheimer's analysts prefer the former's shares to the latter's. On Sunday, they put a $300 price tag on Alphabet, about 18% above Friday's close and the highest on Wall Street, and an $825 target on Meta, 15% higher than last week's finish and below Visible Alpha's analyst average. The Oppenheimer analysts cited what they considered "more conservative" Street estimates on Alphabet, along with a lower valuation on the shares. While the Magnificent Seven group of big tech stocks has outpaced the S&P 500 this year, under the hood there are signs that it might make sense to pick and choose carefully among them. One example: Three of the stocks have underperformed the S&P 500 this year. "While we are positive on the long-term benefits from Meta's push into AI and proven ability to outgrow peers," they wrote, "we are more bullish on [Alphabet] near term, given more conservative estimates and lower valuation." While the Magnificent 7 is running ahead of the S&P 500 this year, it's not surprising that investors might be looking to pick and choose among the group these days: Three of the seven stocks have underperformed the benchmark index year-to-date. More stocks outside the group are lifting the index than in recent years, Capital Group wrote last week, a reference to what's known as market breadth, marking "a healthy move away from the extreme concentration that raised concerns about risks to investor portfolios." "Rising valuations among companies in the index and more clarity on tariffs and interest rate cuts could help lift the U.S. equities market, which has trailed those in Europe and elsewhere," Capital Group wrote.

Reliance Industries saw a 14% profit jump in the September quarter. Strong 5G growth, a recovering oil-to-chemicals business, and expanding retail operations fueled this success. The company is also investing significantly in new energy initiatives and artificial intelligence. Jio Platforms added more subscribers, and Reliance Retail saw robust sales growth. Analysts have slightly improved their outlook for the company.

Title: $200B AppLovin faces data privacy probe after short-sellers allege misconduct: sources
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/10/19/business/applovin-faces-data-privacy-probe-after-short-sellers-allege-misconduct-sources/
Time Published: 2025-10-19T17:58:32Z
Full Content:
Fast-growing tech giant AppLovin is facing fresh regulatory heat over its handling of consumer data –including potential investigations by multiple state attorneys general, The Post has learned. The Silicon Valley firm – a mobile advertising juggernaut worth more than $200 billion that made headlines this spring with an offer to buy TikTok – was rocked this month by a reported Securities and Exchange Commission probe over data privacy. The SEC is investigating whether AppLovin “misled investors about its data collection and ad-targeting methods” after short-sellers alleged it had used digital “fingerprints” to improperly track users for targeted ads, according to Bloomberg. On Wednesday, AppLovin said it shut down a product called “Array” that an ad researcher claimed downloaded apps onto user’s phones without their consent. The disclosure came days after researcher Ben Edelman, who holds a short position on AppLovin, claimed in an Oct. 13 report to have found source code that enabled forced downloads. Edelman’s allegations remain unsubstantiated. A rep for AppLovin responded that “users must explicitly consent to download an application as a result of any of our ads,” noting that “Array was a test product.” Meanwhile, state regulators, including staff from the attorneys general from Delaware, Oregon and Connecticut, have reached out to multiple short sellers, seemingly as part of a preliminary investigation into AppLovin, according to sources close to the situation and emails reviewed by The Post. The probe, which apparently began in March and continued through the summer, is focused on AppLovin’s data collection practices, according to sources familiar with the investigation. Delaware has taken the lead on the probe, which is thought to be in its early stages, sources said. Several third-party data brokers with ties to AppLovin have received subpoenas as part of the probe, the sources added. “We do not comment on, confirm, or deny investigations,” a spokesperson for the Delaware attorney general’s office said. When provided a detailed list of questions for comment, AppLovin said it is “not engaged in any investigations with any state attorneys general regarding its business; nor has the Company been contacted by any state attorneys general regarding any such alleged investigation.” “AppLovin operates an advertising platform with industry-consistent, platform policies and enforcement measures regarding, among other things, ad content,” the company added in a statement. “These platform policies and measures apply to both publishers and demand side users (i.e., advertisers), and specifically address things like explicit content and other ad content.’ In addition to any local data privacy and consumer protection laws, states have enforcement authority under the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act, a federal law meant to shield online users 13 or younger. In 2023, a coalition of 33 states sued Meta alleging violations of COPPA. It couldn’t be learned if the state investigators were focused on potential violations of COPPA or any other specific law in their probe. So far, the allegations have done little to slow the meteoric rise of AppLovin, which has been fueled by interest in its AI-powered software that helps app developers find new users and sell advertising. The company, which claims to have built a better mousetrap in an ad tech sector long dominated by Meta and Google, has seen shares surge 80% this year and was recently added to the S&P 500. Founded in 2012 by CEO Adam Foroughi, John Krystynak and Andrew Karam, AppLovin was originally centered on mobile gaming, but has increasingly refocused its business on its app monetization software. AppLovin’s rapid rise was threatened in February by a slew of short seller reports published by firms including Fuzzy Panda Research, Muddy Waters and Culper Research. AppLovin has denied the claims in these reports. In its bombshell analysis, Fuzzy Panda alleged that AppLovin “appears to be illegally tracking children” in violation of federal law – in part by assigning unique digital “fingerprints” to underage accounts specifically labeled “do not track” and despite Apple and Google policies prohibiting the practice. Fuzzy Panda also published evidence that AppLovin allegedly served explicit and violent third-party animated ads despite parental controls being activated. Those included one that depicted a scantily clad woman being spanked by her boss and another showing an elderly grandmother being attacked with a cleaver. In the report that allegedly contributed to the probe, Fuzzy Panda said it set up a dummy account for a 10-year-old boy to test AppLovin’s alleged data tracking – and found that the firm assigned a unique ID tracking the account as it played games titled “Save The Girl!” and “Mr. Bullet 3D.” Fuzzy Panda accused AppLovin of combining those identifiers with data from third-party brokers to “enhance the fingerprint and effectively track children” in violation of federal law. In the report, Fuzzy Panda said its analysis of an old but still-accessible software development kit used by AppLovin revealed the firm was “collecting 50 different attributes from children’s devices including (geolocation data; unique device identification; and even the exact boot-up time to millisecond” that could be used to specify which users in a household were kids. The Post could not independently verify the analysis. Apple explicitly bars developers from “fingerprinting” users, underage or otherwise, in its terms of service, as did Google until it tweaked the policy in February. Culper Research alleged on Feb. 26 that it had uncovered evidence that AppLovin had “systematically deployed, then exploited incredibly dangerous app permissions that enable in-app ads themselves to force-feed silent, backdoor app installations directly onto users’ phones, with just a single click.” Culper cited research by Edelman, who later released his own report this month in which he compiled more than 200 user complaints about alleged forced downloads linked to AppLovin’s Array product, including cases where users reportedly noticed apps downloading without a notification as they watched an ad on their phone. Foroughi previously denied short seller allegations of wrongdoing in a Feb 26 blog post, writing that the company does not track kids’ data and is compliant with all app store rules. “It’s disappointing that a few nefarious short-sellers are making false and misleading claims aimed at undermining our success, and driving down our stock price for their own financial gain, rather than acknowledging the sophisticated AI models our team has built to enhance advertising for our partners,” Foroughani said at the time. When reached for comment for this story, an AppLovin rep reiterated that the short seller reports are “false and misleading” made by parties with “clear financial motivations,” and contradicted by “third party sources” as well as the company’s own statements. The allegations against AppLovin emerged as Congress steps up its efforts to protect kids online in response to several major scandals in which underage users were exposed to harmful content or privacy violations. Earlier this year, Senate lawmakers reintroduced an updated version of COPPA, which would bar targeted ads for people under age 17. Other legal challenges are brewing, including a suit by a California resident who claims that AppLovin tracked her “purchasing decisions, app usage…her movements and locations” without her permission and despite her turning off location tracking software on her phone. The complaint alleges that AppLovin continued to track her using reverse IP look-up technology and “monetized” her information to “unknown third parties.” Advertisement

Title: A $5 billion deal key to CoreWeave's AI empire just lost another investor's support

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A large shareholder in Core Scientific, a data center developer and operator, said he would reject a proposed purchase of the company by the rival data center firm CoreWeave in an upcoming shareholder vote. "Under the math of the deal today, I would have to vote no," Trip Miller, the founder of the investment firm Gullane Capital, told Business Insider on Friday afternoon. Gullane, based in Memphis, Tennessee, is the third-largest shareholder in Core Scientific, behind Vanguard and BlackRock, and owns a stake in the company worth about $200 million. Miller's opposition adds to other recent pushback against the deal, casting doubt on one of the year's largest data center mergers. CoreWeave — the AI cloud darling racing to scale its computing power — needs the roughly $5 billion takeover to help it continue to grow rapidly and also cut billions of dollars in soaring costs. But a dip in its stock price has weakened the offer's value, exacerbating investor concerns that the deal sharply undervalues Core Scientific just weeks before shareholders are set to vote on the transaction. On October 14, Two Seas Capital, another investment firm that owns about 6.3% of Core Scientific's stock, published a lengthy presentation that outlined its myriad objections to the takeover, including that it was not profitable enough for stock owners. The firm urged investors to reject it in the upcoming shareholder vote on October 30. In response, the CEO of the Livingston, New Jersey-based CoreWeave said the acquisition was "the most compelling path forward for Core Scientific stockholders" and that the present deal would be its "best and final" offer for the company. "The combination will offer Core Scientific and CoreWeave stockholders the opportunity to benefit from the tremendous upside potential and long-term value creation driven by greater verticalization," Michael Intrator, CoreWeave's CEO, wrote in a letter published on October 16. Intrator said the complaints from Two Seas Capital were "misleading and misinformed." CoreWeave's rapid, debt-fueled growth has thrust it into the center of a growing debate over whether AI speculation has become a bubble or if early movers like it are seizing on a historic investment opportunity. In July, CoreWeave announced that it had reached an agreement to buy Core Scientific in a stock conversion deal that valued Core Scientific at roughly $9 billion at the time and $20.40 per share — a 66% per share premium over what Core Scientific stock had then been recently trading for. But in the ensuing months, the economics have shifted as CoreWeave's shares have dipped and Core Scientific's have risen. The stock conversion deal currently values Core Scientific's shares at around $17, more than 10% below its market price of about $19 on Friday.CoreWeave and Core Scientific did not respond to requests to comment. "This is not a popular deal, I think for one simple reason: it's a flawed structure," Miller said. "It would be a deal that would value my shares, actually, at a discount to what they currently trade for today." Since a shaky initial public offering in March, CoreWeave has raced to a $70 billion market capitalization — more than three times its value after the IPO — and a place at the forefront of the booming data center business. It has announced blockbuster deals with some of the biggest names in artificial intelligence, including OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, and the chipmaker Nvidia, and has spent billions of dollars snapping up AI developers and cloud providers to broaden its capabilities and customer offerings. In the company's second-quarter earnings call, Intrator said that its biggest customers required the development of infrastructure, including data centers, on a "planetary" scale. "We are aggressively expanding our footprint on the back of intensifying demand signals from our customers, ensuring that we maintain a durable, multi-year runway for growth," Michael Intrator, CoreWeave's CEO and cofounder, said in the company's second quarter earnings call. CoreWeave said it is expanding its roughly 470 megawatts of operating data centers to more than 900 megawatts by the end of 2025 — enough power to light up about a fifth of New York City on an average day. The Core Scientific acquisition would more than double that by operational megawattage and expand the company's pipeline of contracted future power by 50% to more than 3 gigawatts. Revenue for CoreWeave in the second quarter was $1.2 billion, more than double the same period a year prior, the company reported, and its revenue backlog of $30.1 billion had doubled since the beginning of the year — demonstrating its tremendous business prospects. Its operating margins, however, fell from 20% to 2% year over year, a sign of how costs are increasingly eating into the company's profitability. The company reported its debt had grown to $11.2 billion at the end of the second quarter, a 40% increase from the beginning of the year, and that its borrowing costs ranged from 7% to 15% on its various loans. Gil Luria, an analyst who covers the company, has raised concerns about the high-cost borrowing compared to the company's slimmer profit margins. "They're selling $20 bills for 15 bucks," Luria said. "Sometimes we forget to ask ourselves if this business should even exist," Luria said. "I'm not sure the answer is yes." Acquiring Core Scientific would streamline some of CoreWeave's mounting overhead. CoreWeave rents roughly 270 megawatts of data center space from Core Scientific, and owning the company would allow CoreWeave to save about $10 billion in lease payments for that space over the next 12 years, it has said. "They realize how important this is to the long-term viability of their business model, owning the economics around their largest cost, which is data centers," said Raul Martynek, the CEO of the data center developer and operator DataBank, which is not involved in the deal. Martynek said that Intrator's response letter signified the CEO was making a "full-throated defense of their offer" to purchase Core Scientific. Among the concerns outlined in its presentation, Two Seas said that the deal didn't offer shareholders protection from stock fluctuations that have upended the economics of the transaction. "The initial headline deal price of $20.40 per share undervalued Core Scientific's intrinsic value and strategic value to CoreWeave," Two Seas Capital wrote. "Following one of the worst post-deal drawdowns in an acquirer's stock price since 2020; the current deal value of less than $18 per share reflects a take-under of Core Scientific." In his letter on Thursday, Intrator wrote that CoreWeave represents Core Scientific's only meaningful data center customer and that its business accounts for 76% of Core Scientific's revenue. Intrator added that Core Scientific investors should "think objectively about Core Scientific's stand-alone prospects and the significant risks involved" in rejecting the deal and remaining an independent company." Miller disagreed, stating that in a hot data center market, "the belief is, if you leave this company alone for 18 months, it's a $30 to $40 company" per share, and that he felt it could be a more lucrative acquisition target.

US banking sector concerns sparked a sell off in Europe with major banking stocks in Ireland and the UK tumbling, including Bank of Ireland, AIB, and Barclays. The Iseq All-Share index ended the session down 1.83 per cent on 11,438.22. Few of the big stocks ended in the black. Kerry Group was one, ending the day 0.78 per cent firmer on €77.45, alongside healthcare services group Uniphar plc, which was up 0.13 per cent. Irish Ferries brand owner Irish Continental Group also went against the tide to close 0.34 per cent ahead. The losses were led by Bank of Ireland and AIB which fell 5.7 per cent and 3.47 per cent respectively amid fears over credit quality in US regional banks which rippled through markets on Friday. Permanent TSB Group got off more lightly, falling 0.43 per cent to end the week on €2.29. Listed home builders also suffered, all ending in the red. Cairn Homes was down 2.07 per cent to €1.896. Glenveagh Properties was off 0.87 per cent and Irish Residential Properties REIT fell 1.07 per cent. Further share price drops came from wind and solar energy group Greencoat Renewables – down 2.62 per cent – and titanium minerals miner Kenmare Resources, which shed another 2.5 per cent at the end of a difficult week for the group. London’s benchmark index hit a two-week low on Friday, weighed down by losses in heavyweight lenders that joined a global sell-off in financial stocks. The benchmark FTSE 100 ended down 0.9 per cent at 9,353 points. Though off its session lows, the index still marked its second consecutive week in the red. The banks index shed 3.1 per cent. HSBC, Barclays and Standard Chartered fell 3 per cent, 5.4 per cent and 3.2 per cent respectively as investors revived memories of the crisis of confidence that shook sentiment just over two years ago. Defensive sectors were among those in positive territory, with personal goods, beverages, personal care, drug & grocery and utilities reflecting the cautious mood among investors. The aerospace and defence index dropped 3.5 per cent, tracking losses in European counterparts. Among other movers, precious metal miner Fresnillo slumped 11 per cent as gold and platinum prices tumbled. Pearson gained 2.5 per cent to the top of FTSE 100 as the education company expects stronger sales growth in the fourth quarter. Man Group gained 6.3 per cent after the hedge fund’s growth in assets under management surpassed expectations. The continent-wide STOXX 600 index closed nearly 1 per cent lower but still managed to log a modest weekly gain of 0.4 per cent. European banks were down 2.5 per cent, with Deutsche Bank, Barclays, Italy’s UniCredit and France’s BNP Paribas all losing between 3.3 per cent and 6.5 per cent. The flight to safety pushed gold to another record high of $4,378.69 per ounce. Luxury stocks helped cushion the broader market as Ray-Ban maker, EssilorLuxottica jumped 13 per cent on investor enthusiasm for its AI-powered Ray-Ban Meta glasses. Luxury was the best performing sector this week, powered by LVMH, which beat forecasts and reported its first quarterly sales rise this year. Continental was up 11.3 per cent after the German auto supplier’s preliminary third-quarter sales came in at €5 billion – just in advance of its own consensus forecast. All three major US stock indices were struggling for direction in midafternoon trading on Friday, while gold pulled back from all-time highs after a record run. Worries over potential systemic credit problems in the banking sector abated the day after Zions disclosed it would take a $50 million loan loss in the third quarter and Western Alliance initiated a lawsuit alleging fraud by an investment firm. The KBW Regional Banking index advanced in a partial recovery from Thursday’s 5 per cent plunge. Amid cooling of tariff rhetoric between Washington and Beijing, analysts now expect third-quarter S&P 500 earnings growth of 9.3 per cent year-on-year, up from 8.8 per cent as of October 1st, according to LSEG data. – Additional reporting, Reuters, PA.

Title: Investor Insanity? The Degenerate Economy Index Up 130%
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/boazsobrado/2025/10/17/investor-insanity-the-degenerate-economy-index-up-130/

Full Content:
ByBoaz Sobrado, Contributor. Howard Lindzon, co-founder and CEO of StockTwits, created an index in May 2023 that tracks companies enabling gambling, day trading, and memecoin speculation. It has returned 130% since inception. The index includes the cornerstone of the speculative economy. It holds Nvidia, Apple, Robinhood, Coinbase, DraftKings, and Bitcoin. These are the infrastructure providers for what Lindzon calls the Degenerate Economy, where investing has converged with entertainment and the lines between trading and gambling have collapsed entirely. Traditional investors find themselves in an uncomfortable position. While retail trading is generally considered to be uninformed, it effectively drives the market. Traditional investors can dismiss what retail traders are doing, or they can acknowledge that Howard Lindzon’s index has doubled the returns of conventional benchmarks while holding household names alongside controversial platforms. The performance gap demands explanation beyond simply calling market participants degenerates. Lindzon built the Degenerate Economy Index around 13 public companies plus Bitcoin. The portfolio divides into clear categories that reveal how speculation became infrastructure. The technology backbone includes Nvidia, Apple, Google, and Meta. These companies provide the computing power, mobile devices, cloud services, and social networks that enable 24/7 access to markets. Without smartphones and social media, retail speculation remains constrained to trading hours and requires desktop computers. The trading platforms include Robinhood, Coinbase, and Interactive Brokers. Commission-free trading, mobile-first design, and cryptocurrency access democratized speculation in ways that traditional brokerages never attempted. Robinhood alone has 24 million funded accounts, most under age 35. The derivatives infrastructure includes CME Group and CBOE. These exchanges provide the futures, options, and volatility products that professional and retail traders use for leveraged speculation. The existence of 3x leveraged ETFs and weekly options expiries reflects demand for higher-risk instruments. DraftKings represents the sports betting category. The company went public in 2020 and now operates in 25 states with 5 million monthly active users. Sports betting legalization following the 2018 PASPA Supreme Court decision created an entirely new category of speculation accessible from phones. Bitcoin itself holds a position in the index. Not as currency or store of value, but as the original digital speculation vehicle that introduced millions to 24/7 trading and extreme volatility as entertainment. The index has seen only about 10 changes since inception. This represents high conviction in the infrastructure thesis rather than trading around momentum. Lindzon is not betting on which memecoin wins or which sports betting platform dominates. He is betting that the infrastructure enabling speculation continues growing regardless of individual winners and losers. The 130% return over 18 months occurred during a period of significant market uncertainty. Interest rates rose from near zero to 5.5%. Regional banks collapsed. Commercial real estate faced existential questions. Geopolitical tensions escalated. None of this mattered to the Degenerate Economy Index. Robinhood stock increased from $8 in May 2023 to over $40 by January 2025. It currently trades at $130. Coinbase moved from $50 to $330 over the same period. Nvidia returned over many multiples as AI demand for GPUs accelerated. DraftKings doubled despite increasing competition in sports betting. The performance occurred because the infrastructure providers collect their rake regardless of whether individual speculators win or lose. Robinhood earns revenue from payment for order flow, margin interest, and premium subscriptions. Coinbase charges transaction fees on every trade. Nvidia sells chips whether they mine Bitcoin or train AI models. CME Group collects fees on every futures contract regardless of who profits. This represents the fundamental insight behind the index construction. Lindzon invested in the arms dealers, not the soldiers. The casinos, not the gamblers. The platforms, not the users. More conservative market participants may argue that this rewards the casino-ification of markets. They point to Robinhood's gamification features, Coinbase's promotion of questionable tokens, and DraftKings' advertising targeting young males with gambling problems. These criticisms are accurate. They are also irrelevant to whether the companies generate profits and grow user bases. Three technological convergences enable the Degenerate Economy and show no signs of reversing. Mobile platforms provide the foundation. The iPhone launched in 2007 and Android followed shortly after. By 2023, global smartphone penetration exceeded 6.8 billion users. These devices enable what Lindzon calls "living life with a wallet on your phone" where stocks, crypto, sports bets, and NFTs sit accessible with a few taps. The friction of desktop trading and phone calls to brokers disappeared. Social networks provide the distribution mechanism. StockTwits, which Lindzon founded in 2008, now has 6 million users discussing markets in real time. Twitter financial content reaches hundreds of millions. Reddit's WallStreetBets has 15 million members. Discord servers coordinate trading activity. Information that previously required expensive Bloomberg terminals or Wall Street Journal subscriptions now spreads instantly and free across social platforms. Blockchain and cryptocurrency provide the rails for 24/7 global trading. Markets that previously closed at 4pm EST now operate continuously. Weekends on StockTwits trend with memecoin tickers rather than traditional stocks. Coinbase reported that approximately 1 million tokens per week are being created as of January 2025. The barriers to launching speculative instruments have collapsed to near zero. The economic context makes these technologies particularly potent. Housing affordability in the US reached its worst level in decades. Student debt exceeds $1.7 trillion. Wage growth lags asset price appreciation. For younger cohorts priced out of traditional wealth building through homeownership and stable employment, high-risk speculation represents a rational response rather than irrational exuberance. Commentators have coined the term "financial nihilism" to describe this phenomenon. When you have nothing to lose, perceived risk changes dramatically. A 23-year-old with no realistic path to buying a house may reasonably conclude that risking $5,000 on memecoins or sports betting parlays offers better expected value than saving for a down payment that never arrives. Sports betting provides the clearest quantitative evidence of speculation becoming entertainment. The Wall Street Journal reported in January 2025 that America is "addicted to parlay bets." Studies show sports betting significantly reduces household savings and increases credit card debt among financially constrained households. The National Council on Problem Gambling estimates $14 billion in social costs from problem gambling, with 38% of male sports bettors aged 18-49 reporting betting more than they should. Crypto adoption follows similar patterns. Coinbase has 108 million verified users. MetaMask has over 30 million monthly active users. These numbers represent genuine adoption rather than speculative bubbles that burst and disappear. The infrastructure exists and users remain engaged even when individual tokens collapse. Market structure has fundamentally shifted in ways that benefit the index holdings. The top 10 stocks now represent 38% of the S&P 500, matching dot-com bubble concentration levels. Passive flows create what Epsilon Theory's Michael Green calls "a giant mindless robot" market where price discovery occurs through flows rather than fundamental analysis. Social sentiment now leads price action rather than following it, and its global. South Koreans stream live perpetual futures trading like esports competitions in what they call "T-POP" (Trading as K-POP). Similar phenomena emerge in India and China. This is not an American cultural quirk but a global transformation in how markets operate. Lindzon himself expressed doubts about the thesis in August 2024. "The term 'degenerate economy' is sloppy in that I do not want to glorify the idea that you are on your own. I take pride in helping people learn the language of the markets. My utopian idea of this economy is that 'speculation is entertainment' and 'investing is a sport'. That is not happening." He considered changing the terminology but ultimately continued using it while emphasizing education and risk management. The discomfort stems from observing friends joke about investing in gambling addiction treatment centers as a growth industry. The normalization of behavior that previous generations would consider pathological creates ethical questions that performance data does not answer. The January 2025 launch of Trump and Melania memecoins crystallized these concerns. The $TRUMP token hit $60 billion in initial valuation three days before inauguration. This represents a massive wealth transfer from retail speculators to insiders rather than democratization of finance. Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum's founder, experienced a crisis of faith in February 2024: "Do I feel good when I hear people from crypto twitter and VC firms telling me that PvP KOL degen casino that's money-losing for over 99% of its own users is the best product market fit that crypto is going to get?" This captures the tension between builders wanting utility and markets demanding entertainment. Traditional value investors see casino-ification killing price discovery and allocating capital inefficiently. When GameStop or AMC trade based on social media sentiment rather than business fundamentals, markets stop performing their core function of directing resources toward productive uses. These concerns are valid, but they do not make the Degenerate Economy Index wrong as an investment thesis. Investors face a choice. They can refuse to participate in infrastructure they find morally questionable and accept lower returns. Or they can acknowledge that opposing a trend does not stop it from generating profits. The Degenerate Economy Index provides a framework for the latter approach. By focusing on infrastructure providers rather than attempting to pick winning meme stocks, investors gain exposure to the trend without participating in its most problematic aspects. Owning Nvidia does not require endorsing AI girlfriends. Owning Apple does not require approving of mobile gambling addiction. Owning CME Group does not require celebrating leveraged speculation by retail traders. These companies provide tools that serve many purposes, some productive and some destructive. The counterargument holds that providing the infrastructure makes you complicit in the outcomes. Often people seek out “ethical” investments which avoid alcohol companies, casinos, tobacco, or any industry with negative externalities. Investors must decide their own ethical boundaries. For now, the performance data suggests that those boundaries cost money. The 60 percentage point gap between the Degenerate Economy Index and the Nasdaq-100 over 18 months represents real wealth not created for those avoiding the trend. Lindzon’s advice to his son Max perhaps illustrates a middle path: if you are going to make a parlay bet, invest an equal amount in the Degenerate Economy Index. The Degenerate Economy entered what Lindzon calls "Ludicrous Mode" in January 2025. The SEC rescinded SAB 121, allowing banks to custody Bitcoin. David Sacks serves as Crypto Czar. Robinhood, Visa, Wells Fargo, and Goldman Sachs all hit all-time highs simultaneously. Both old and new financial platforms benefit from the same trend. Traditional banks adding crypto custody compete with Coinbase while simultaneously validating the asset class. This represents market expansion rather than zero-sum competition. Lindzon predicts several developments that would further benefit index holdings. Vegas sportsbooks will morph into "degenerate economy clubs" combining gambling, trading, and entertainment. CNBC's Squawk Box could evolve into a global streaming phenomenon focused on trading as sport. On-chain peer-to-peer betting will expand to cover everything from stock movements to sports outcomes to prediction markets. The wealth gap will accelerate dramatically as asset owners vastly outperform wage earners. Retail participation may reach 30% of market volume, up from historical 20%, as platforms become more sophisticated. AI will replace traditional Wall Street analysts for many functions, further commoditizing financial research. For crypto specifically, Lindzon predicts that supply will crush demand. With 1 million tokens created weekly, most will fail spectacularly. This benefits infrastructure providers like Coinbase that collect fees regardless of which tokens succeed. The platforms always win. The question facing investors is whether this represents a temporary mania that will revert or a permanent transformation in market structure. The 18-month performance of the Degenerate Economy Index suggests the latter. The technological infrastructure exists and cannot be uninvented. The economic conditions driving participation show no signs of improving. The regulatory environment is becoming more permissive rather than restrictive. Traditional investors can question their sanity for participating in what they see as casino-ification of markets. The alternative is questioning their sanity for ignoring a trend that has doubled benchmark returns while showing no signs of reversal.

Title: Will the AI Bubble Trigger a Financial Crisis?

Experts might not expect a stock-market crash to cause a financial crisis, but what if they are wrong? With leverage built up in so many parts of the system and asset-price movements so closely correlated, the current US financial system looks like a tinder box just waiting for a spark to land on it. WASHINGTON, DC – OpenAI Co-Founder Sam Altman, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have joined the chorus of people talking about an AI bubble and expressing concern that the US economy will nosedive when it bursts. But what would a post-bubble nosedive look like? Given the weakness in almost every other sector of the US economy, it could well mean a recession. Economic slumps come in many flavors, though, and the worst tend to follow from financial crises. Yet most experts (with a few exceptions) have not warned of the AI bubble causing a financial crisis. Instead, the conventional wisdom seems to be that if there is a recession, it will look more like the one that followed the dot-com bubble in 2000 than the one following the 2008 global financial crisis. History does provide some support for this view. One well known paper on bubbles and financial crises concludes that “the post-WW2 era appears to have weathered numerous equity price bubbles that did not turn into financial crisis episodes.” But the authors also note that equity-price bubbles can precipitate financial crises if they are fueled by borrowed money. After all, the Great Depression was preceded by a debt-fueled “roaring 20s” equity bubble. This matters because, as economist Noah Smith points out, banks are funding “private credit” funds that in turn are lending money to fund the data-center construction for an anticipated AI boom. Smith wonders whether we will see defaults on those construction loans when the AI bubble bursts, and whether private credit losses could cause a crisis for the banks that ultimately extended that credit. It is also worth pondering whether a bursting AI bubble could compromise the ability of other non-bank financial institutions to repay their loans. A recent JPMorgan analyst note on hedge-fund trading observes that concentration in the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks (companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Nvidia) remains near historic highs. Yet the prices of these stocks are highly dependent on the companies’ AI ambitions. If they fall short of their goals, and prices come crashing down, highly leveraged hedge funds may be forced into fire sales, unloading stocks to meet margin calls or repay bank loans. And if those fire sales don’t fetch enough cash, the funds will default on their repayment obligations, potentially undermining the financial condition of the broker-dealers, primary dealers, and banks that extended them credit. Moreover, the same dynamics will also drive down the prices of tech stocks further, potentially forcing other leveraged financial institutions to sell off their portfolios, and so on. Nor should we assume that financial institutions desperate for cash will restrict themselves to selling off tech stocks. On the contrary, they may need – or prefer – to dump other types of assets, transmitting problems to other asset markets.

SUBSCRIBE NOW Such a scenario is not far-fetched. The Fed reports that hedge-fund leverage hit historically high levels in 2024, and in a September 2025 commentary, analyst Adam Josephson notes that “hedge fund borrowing/leverage [is] at a record high of $6.2 trillion, up more than 25% vs. a year ago at the end of March.” Specifically, outstanding margin loans from broker-dealers and repurchase agreements from primary dealers are at historically high levels. And bank lending (particularly lending by large banks) to non-bank financial institutions – including broker-dealers, primary dealers, and the hedge funds themselves – is also significantly elevated, with bank loans to NBFIs now accounting for “$1.7 trillion in bank loans, or 13% of loans outstanding.” Meanwhile, US financial regulators continue to permit this expansion of leverage, as well as greenlighting the integration of traditional financial markets with crypto markets (which are also rife with leverage). Despite narratives about Bitcoin and other crypto assets serving as a hedge against risks in other markets, their price movements are highly correlated with equities. Thus, we should expect to see crypto prices fall when the AI bubble bursts, and not just because of fire-sale dynamics. Both crypto and the AI bubble have been inflated by the same kinds of narratives about new technologies shattering old paradigms. If evidence of AI’s limitations starts to permeate the public consciousness during a market crash, more pessimistic sentiment on tech assets could well undermine crypto hype as well. This could then prompt a crash in Ponzi-like crypto assets such as Bitcoin, as well as runs on asset-backed stablecoins. If stablecoin issuers are forced to withdraw their cash reserves from banks, they could trigger a run on those institutions; and if they are forced to dump Treasuries from their reserves, another critically important financial market could be sucked into the maelstrom. Experts might not expect a stock-market crash to cause a financial crisis, but what if they are wrong? With leverage built up in so many parts of the system and asset-price movements so correlated, what if the financial system is a tinder box that could explode when the first spark lands on it? Of course, the financial system may well weather the bursting of the AI bubble, especially if the end arrives with a low hiss rather than a sudden bang. But we shouldn’t count on it.

Title: META Appears To Be A More Attractive Buy Compared To Alphabet Stock

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. META is Alphabet's counterpart within the Interactive Media & Services sector that possesses: 1) A lower valuation (P/OpInc) in comparison to Alphabet stock2) Yet higher revenue and operating income growth This disparity between valuation and performance could suggest that investing in META stock is more advantageous than purchasing GOOGL stock Investing in individual stocks can be precarious, but there is significant value in adopting a broader diversified strategy as we do with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management – a wealth management firm in the Boston area – which has implemented asset allocation strategies yielding positive returns during the 2008-09 timeframe when the S&P declined over 40%. Empirical has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio into this asset allocation strategy to deliver improved returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; providing a smoother investment experience, as shown in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – S&P 500 Poised For A 40% Crash? OpInc = Operating Income, P/OpInc = Price To Operating Income Ratio Do these figures, however, encompass the entire picture? Read Buy or Sell GOOGL Stock to determine if Alphabet still possesses an advantage that remains viable beneath the surface. For context, Alphabet (GOOGL) offers a variety of products and services, including advertising, Android, Chrome, hardware, cloud solutions, health technology, and internet services across diverse markets. This is merely one method for assessing investments. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio conducts a more comprehensive evaluation and is designed to mitigate stock-specific risks while providing potential growth opportunities. A method to evaluate whether Alphabet stock is currently overpriced compared to other tickers would involve examining how these metrics compared among companies exactly one year ago. Specifically, if there has been a notable trend reversal for Alphabet over the past 12 months, then the ongoing disparity may likely reverse. Conversely, sustained underperformance in revenue and operating income growth for Alphabet would reinforce the notion that its stock is overpriced relative to its competitors but might not revert soon. OpInc = Operating Income Considering buying based on valuation, while appealing, must be assessed thoroughly from various perspectives. This multi-faceted evaluation is precisely how we develop Trefis portfolio strategies. If you desire potential gains with a more stable journey than an individual stock offers, explore the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P, delivering over 91% returns since its inception.

Business Shares in Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica rose 14 per cent to hit an all-time high on Friday, adding nearly $20 billion in market value as investor enthusiasm for its AI-powered Ray-Ban Meta glasses gathered momentum. The Paris-listed group, founded by late Italian entrepreneur Leonardo Del Vecchio and a possible contender in the race to buy fashion group Armani, reported on Thursday third-quarter sales growth of 11.7 per cent from a year ago to 6.9 billion euros ($8.1 billion). The results beat expectations and marked the company's best quarterly performance ever amid strong demand for wearable products such as the smart glasses it has been developing with Meta since before the pandemic. Even though the smart glasses business has until now accounted for only a fraction of EssilorLuxottica's total revenue, it has become a focal point for analysts and investors, as well as a catalyst for the company's investments.
