ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. As long as large AI cloud services providers are eager to buy nuclear energy, these investments ... More could enrich your portfolio. As power hungry AI cloud services providers seek ever more energy, nuclear energy is enjoying a revival. While younger people who did not live through the near-meltdowns such as Chernobyl (1986) and Three Mile Island (1979) are bullish, the regulatory and financial barriers to building nuclear power plants remain formidable. Nevertheless, capital providers see these barriers as worth hurdling. With annual investment in nuclear power doubling to $60 billion since 2020, nuclear power could energize your portfolio. For example, Microsoft signed a 20-year agreement to use power from Three Mile Island, and Meta signed a similar deal with another nuclear power facility. To profit from this trend while considering the risks, read on for three publicly-traded stocks and three exchange traded funds which could rise along with demand for nuclear energy. With concerns about energy security and climate change on the rise, nuclear power is experiencing a resurgence. Roughly 400 reactors are now operating in 31 countries providing about 5% of the world’s electricity. What’s more, new nuclear reactors are being constructed. Of the 63 nuclear reactors being built, many deploy new technologies such as Small Modular Reactors – which are safer and smaller – and advanced Generation IV reactors, wrote Goldman Sachs. Another positive is the support for nuclear power from younger people who lack a direct memory of previous disasters and recognize nuclear’s “role in decarbonization efforts,” reports Strats Research. Nevertheless, nuclear faces significant challenges, including the following: Baltimore, Maryland-based Constellation Energy Corporation produces and sells electricity, natural gas, energy-related products and sustainable solutions in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New York, ERCOT and other power regions. Constellation is a top choice because it is the largest operator of nuclear reactors in the United States and a major provider of carbon-free electricity. The company's focus on nuclear power provides a reliable source of baseload electricity and makes it an attractive partner for technology companies needing consistent power for data centers. For instance, Meta recently announced a 20-year nuclear agreement with Constellation. Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based Cameco Corporation provides uranium through three segments: Uranium, Fuel Services and Westinghouse. The Uranium segment explores for, mines, mills, purchases and sells uranium concentrate. The Fuel Services segment refines, converts, and fabricates uranium concentrate. The Westinghouse segment makes nuclear reactor technology equipment and provides products and services to commercial utilities and government agencies, reported Yahoo! Finance. As one of the world's largest uranium producers, Cameco is a top choice because it is likely to benefit from increasing nuclear fuel demand. The company has substantial high-grade uranium reserves and long-term contracts with utility companies, providing a degree of stability. Cameco also has an ownership stake in Westinghouse Electric, providing exposure to nuclear reactor construction, according to SeekingAlpha. Corvallis, Oregon-based NuScale Power provides a small modular reactor technology system -- the NuScale Power Module. The NPM, a water reactor, can generate 77 megawatts of electricity. Founded in 2007, NuScale operates as a subsidiary of Fluor Enterprises, according to Yahoo! Finance. NuScale is a top choice due to the company’s leadership in SMR technology, which offers potential benefits in scalability, safety, and faster deployment compared to traditional large reactors. The company’s SMR design is the first to be certified by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, giving it a potential first-mover advantage in this emerging technology, according to 24/7 Wall Street. One year price change: 48.7% Top five holdings: The VanEck Uranium and Nuclear ETF The fund normally invests at least 80% of its total assets in securities that comprise the fund's benchmark index of equity securities and depositary receipts issued by uranium and nuclear energy companies, according to Yahoo! Finance. The ETF is a top choice because it offers broader exposure to the nuclear energy sector beyond just uranium miners. It includes uranium miners, nuclear power plant builders and maintainers, nuclear electricity producers, and related equipment and technology. The fund's exposure to utilities can make a portfolio more defensive. One year price change: 50% Top five holdings: Range Nuclear Renaissance Index ETF normally invests in securities of nuclear fuel and energy – particularly in the areas of advanced reactors; utilities; construction and services; and/or fuel. Under normal circumstances, the fund invests at least 80% of its net assets in securities of nuclear companies. The ETF is a top choice because it tracks a custom index reflecting the nuclear industry broadly. It offers significant exposure to advanced reactor technology, including a large position in Oklo, which makes small modular reactors. NUKZ has shown strong performance and offers exposure to the developing advanced nuclear technology sector, according to TipRanks. One year price change: 54.6% Top five holdings: Global X Uranium ETF normally invests at least 80% of its total assets in the securities of the underlying index that tracks the broad based equity market performance of global companies involved in the uranium industry, according to Yahoo! Finance. URA is a top choice because it is the largest and most popular nuclear ETF by assets under management. It provides broad exposure to the uranium and nuclear energy value chain, including uranium producers, nuclear component manufacturers and service providers. This ETF also offers direct exposure to the physical uranium commodity, which is unique among nuclear ETFs. Bottom Line With investment in nuclear power doubling over the last five years, should you invest in companies and ETFs that track its growth? Despite the risks of nuclear power – which include enormous capital requirements, regulatory and political hurdles and the risk of nuclear accidents – the stocks and ETFs highlighted above may offer upside opportunity. As long as large AI cloud services providers are eager to buy nuclear energy, these investments could enrich your portfolio

Title: Ethereum: BitMine’s Bold $60K ETH Call Fails To Offset Stock Slide

Ethereum is on the spotlight as BitMine Immersion Technologies stock took a sharp hit on Monday, falling over 25% despite a fresh round of bullish messaging from Tom Lee of FundStrat. Investors seemed unconvinced by the plan to make BitMine a major holder and staker of Ethereum. The dip came after shares slid over 10% during regular hours to $35, then dropped another 15% in after‑hours trading. According to FundStrat’s Tom Lee, BitMine plans to hold 5% of Ethereum’s total supply and become a “made in America validator network.” He highlighted that BitMine already has 600,000 ETH on its balance sheet—worth more than $2 billion at current prices. Lee even floated the idea that Ether could reach an implied valuation of $60,000, citing unnamed research firms. But those bold figures failed to calm the market. 10/18 We asked several research firms to give us “replacement” value (of Wall Street) to value ETH – this is for illustrative purposes only – implied value for ETH is $60,000 – ETH currently ~$3,800 pic.twitter.com/mXa5uCZukv — Bitmine BMNR (@BitMNR) July 28, 2025 Analysts had pointed out that BitMine’s stock had wildly surged earlier this month. The price shot up more than 3,000% to a yearly high of $135 on July 3 after the initial announcement of the Ether‑buying strategy. That rally was met with a wave of profit‑taking once the plan was fully laid out. Many traders sold into the strength, and the mood shifted quickly when shareholders saw the fine print. Based on reports from Kronos Research, treasury rollouts on this scale require a solid plan to protect capital and maintain liquidity. Vincent Liu, Kronos’s chief investment officer, warned that without clear steps for custody and staking infrastructure, holding large amounts of Ether could create big swings in value. And those swings spooked some investors when Lee’s “Chairman’s Message” failed to pin down exact timelines or reveal audit partners. On top of that, the implied $60,000 target for Ether came from sources that remain unnamed. That lack of transparency set off alarm bells. Investors want to know who did the math and whether the data holds up under scrutiny. When price targets are presented without clear attribution, doubt grows fast. Meanwhile, other firms are also loading up on Ether. SharpLink Gaming controls 438,000 ETH. Bit Digital holds over 100,000 ETH. Blockchain Technology Consensus Solutions recently boosted its stake to 29,122 ETH after raising $62 million. Finality Capital’s partner David Grider compared the trend to Strategy’s big bet on Bitcoin—saying these moves should help ETH flows and price action. Finality Capital, he disclosed, holds a position in BitMine itself. Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Up 80% This Year What's Next For Celestica Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/07/29/up-80-this-year-whats-next-for-celestica-stock/

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CHONGQING, CHINA - JULY 27: In this photo illustration, a person holds a smartphone displaying the ... More logo of Celestica Inc. (NYSE: CLS, TSX: CLS), a Canadian multinational electronics manufacturing services (EMS) company, with the company's red and gray dot-matrix C logo visible in the background, on July 27, 2025 in Chongqing, China. (Photo illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) Celestica (NYSE:CLS) has recently been experiencing significant growth — the stock has risen 80% year-to-date and has more than tripled in value over the past year. What factors are contributing to this increase? The company, recognized for its electronics manufacturing and supply chain services, is benefiting from a surge in demand for AI-powered networking equipment and cloud infrastructure, driven by major technology companies. This upswing is spurring rapid expansion in its Connectivity & Cloud Solutions (CCS) division — a segment that encompasses everything from servers and storage to high-performance networking hardware. In Q1 2025, CCS revenue reached $1.84 billion, an increase of 28% compared to the previous year. The key AI-related offerings within this segment include servers, integrated rack solutions, and high-performance networking switches, all of which are essential for modern AI workloads. The extensive AI boom is projected to maintain demand. Major technology firms are currently engaged in unprecedented cycles of infrastructure investment. Amazon is anticipated to allocate as much as $105 billion for capital expenditures in 2025. Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta are estimated to invest $80 billion, $75 billion, and $72 billion, respectively — much of this directed towards AI infrastructure. This trend should bolster demand for Celestica. How does the stock’s fundamental outlook appear, and will its momentum continue? The stock appears relatively expensive — making it a costly choice to purchase at its current price of around $170. We identify some minor concerns regarding CLS stock. Our conclusion is derived by comparing the current valuation of CLS stock with its operational performance in recent years, in addition to its current and historical financial status. Our assessment of Celestica along crucial metrics of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience indicates that the company possesses a strong operational performance and financial health, as outlined below. However, if you are looking for potential gains with reduced volatility compared to individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative — having outperformed the S&P 500 and yielded returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Also see: QuantumScape: QS Stock To $0? Celestica’s valuation seems high when assessed against the wider market. While its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 2.0 is less than the S&P 500’s 3.1, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 47.8 is considerably higher than the benchmark’s 22.8. Nevertheless, this is supported by the company's robust recent top-line growth. Revenues have risen at an average annual rate of 19.3% over the past three years, significantly surpassing the S&P 500’s 5.3%. Over the last year, Celestica’s Revenues increased by 21% to reach $10 billion, while the S&P 500 only managed a modest growth of 4.4%. However, its profitability remains behind. The net income margin over the past year was only 4.1% (compared to 11.9% for the S&P 500). Nonetheless, operating performance is showing positive trends, with Celestica achieving a record adjusted operating margin of 7.1% in the latest quarter, up from 5.9% in Q1 2024. This upward margin trend and strong revenue should, in time, lead to higher earnings, potentially justifying the company's elevated valuation. From a financial health perspective, Celestica appears robust, with a low debt-to-equity ratio of 4.8%, comfortably below the S&P 500 average of 22.6%. The company maintains a moderate cash reserve that constitutes 5.2% of its total assets. However, CLS stock has historically demonstrated sensitivity to market downturns. For example, during the Covid-19 market crash, CLS plummeted 69% compared to a 33.9% drop in the S&P 500. Likewise, in 2022, amid inflation-related shocks, the stock fell 35.6% during a broader market correction, exceeding the S&P’s 25.4% decline. Additional risks also exist. The company has a significant manufacturing presence in Asia (approximately two-thirds of production), and tariffs imposed by the U.S. government may elevate supply chain costs and exert pressure on profit margins. The high valuation of CLS stock may restrict its upside potential in the near to mid-term. As an alternative, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices), has produced strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided an effective strategy to capitalize on favorable market conditions while mitigating losses during market downturns, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Microsoft Stock Up More Than Amazon. Don’t Buy Into AI-Staff Cuts

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Companies touting AI-driven job cuts rarely see significant stock gains, with most performing only slightly better than the S&P 500.Only Microsoft has achieved market-beating returns by consistently exceeding expectations and leveraging AI for growth.True stock value comes from beating expectations and raising guidance, not just headcount reduction. WASHINGTON, DC - APRIL 01: Fired employees of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) take ... More personal belongings with them as they leave HHS Mary E. Switzer Memorial Building on April 01, 2025 in Washington, DC. Widespread layoffs began today across Health and Human Service Administration offices after it was announced last week that the Trump Administration plans to cut 10,000 jobs at HHS. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) Companies are bragging about their staff cuts even as they invest heavily in artificial intelligence, The Wall Street Journal reported. Only one company – Microsoft – could enjoy market-beating returns. A closer look at the eight companies highlighted – Microsoft, Wells Fargo, Loomis, Bank of America, Verizon, Amazon, Intel and Union Pacific – reveals an important insight for investors: On average, the companies have posted mediocre gains this year – up 9.3% compared to an 8.9% rise in the S&P 500 as of July 25, according to Google Finance. Here’s why you should think twice before investing in the shares of companies promoting their headcount reduction in the wake of AI deployments: Microsoft is the only one of the eight that beat and raised for the last four quarters. Since it is also getting growth from its AI investments, the company’s stock may be the only one of the eight likely to deliver above average investor returns. The average stock price increase of the companies touting their AI-driven job cuts is just slightly ahead of the S&P 500’s increase so far in 2025. Below are the companies along with their stock price change this year as of July 25 and what they have said about their job cuts: Job cut announcements rarely benefit investors. Moreover, such news tends to produce at most 2% stock price increases – if management convinces investors the layoffs are part of a broader AI strategy to enhance productivity. Even such modest bumps last one to three trading days, according to academic research such as Stock investors’ reaction to layoff announcements: A meta-analysis. Moreover, if the layoffs are seen as a reaction to weak demand or lack a clear efficiency narrative, returns are flat or negative, academic research suggests. So what makes investors better off? Stock prices tend to rise when companies beat investor expectations and raise their guidance. “Positive earnings surprises and upward guidance revisions typically lead to positive stock price reactions,” according to quantitative evidence from academic literature such as Warp Speed Price Moves: Jumps after Earnings Announcements. Microsoft has outperformed the other seven companies when it comes to beating revenue and earnings per share expectations and raising guidance ahead of investor views over the last four quarters. More specifically, Microsoft has surpassed investor revenue and EPS expectations in the most recent four quarters and provided positive guidance for the future – which in some cases exceeded consensus estimates. These results suggest Microsoft is monetizing its AI initiatives through growth in demand for its cloud services, according to the company’s Q1 2025 earnings call transcript. Amazon and Intel shares have fallen short of the S&P 500’s return over the last year. The shares of both companies took a beating because they did not consistently exceed investors’ revenue expectations and their guidance was disappointing. For instance, Amazon beat analysts’ EPS expectations each quarter but did not consistently exceed their revenue estimates. Moreover, investors have expressed concern over the e-commerce giant’s sometimes cautious guidance for future quarters, reported Yahoo! Finance. Intel suffered from slightly different problems. The chip giant consistently surpassed revenue estimates in the last four quarters but often missed EPS expectations and provided guidance for future quarters that often fallen short of investor expectations – indicating ongoing challenges in their turnaround strategy, noted Investing.com. Companies that tout their job cuts may repel top talent – which could slow their growth. So, consider investing in the ones that consistently beat expectations and raise guidance above consensus with help from AI investments that yield faster growth.

Title: Trump's trade deals are set to unleash an 11% rally for stocks through year-end, Oppenheimer says

Call it a comeback. After markets went haywire in April, Trump's trade deals might have just saved the bull market, according to Oppenheimer's chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus. After lowering his year-end S&P 500 price target after the Liberation Day tariff announcements, Stoltzfus has reinstated his 7,100 target from December 2024, setting the stock market up for its third consecutive year of 20% gains. In the wake of President Donald Trump's EU and Japan trade deal, Stoltzfus believes the coast is clear for the S&P 500 to continue reaching all-time highs. "We believe that enough 'tariff hurdles' have been overcome for now to reinstate our original price target for the S&P 500 of 7100 by year-end," Stoltzfus wrote in a note on Monday morning. US exceptionalism in the stock market remains intact, Stoltzfus said. The EU trade deal Trump announced on Sunday sets tariffs of 15% on most European imports, half of the 30% Trump initially threatened. The EU has also agreed to purchase a "vast amount" of US military equipment and invest an additional $600 billion in the US. It's not just trade deals, though. US companies have held up financially through the volatility, and they're on track for a better-than-expected second quarter earnings season, Stoltzfus said. Out of the companies that have already reported second quarter earnings, 84% have beaten analyst estimates. Wall Street will be watching this week closely, as 164 companies — including the S&P 500's biggest names such as Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta —are set to report results. Helping the S&P 500's continued climb is the slow place of inflation. Price increases have remained relatively steady and inflation has drawn closer to the Fed's 2% target despite tariff volatility. "Monetary policy by the Fed has brought down the pace of inflation (if not yet to its 2% target level) without thus far causing a recession. This in our view is a substantial achievement considering inflation has gone from 9% in June of 2022 when the Fed recognized that inflation was out of hand to around 2.7% in June of this year," Stoltzfus wrote. Stoltzfus' 7,100 year-end price target implies a forward multiple of 25.8x and an earnings projection of $275. Investors should continue to bet on information technology, consumer discretionary, communications services, industrials, and financials, according to Stoltzfus. Jump to

Aging Cyber Safely Laura Sang Hee Scherling, Josefina Piddo This presentation asks how we can better care for our older adults and improve cybersecurity awareness training and policies with their needs in mind. American adults over the age of 60 filed over 100,000 cybercrime-related complaints to the FBI in 2023 and experienced losses amounting to $3.2 billion. Older adults are the most vulnerable to cybercrime, and studies have found they feel ashamed to disclose having been victims. Although important initiatives exist, such as AllState's training sessions on cyber safety and AARP's free fraud helpline, there's a noticeable shortage in relevant resources. This research examines emerging cybersecurity awareness resources and policies supporting older adults, drawing from interviews with FINRA and the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC). It also presents findings from the cybersecurity awareness initiative founded by the presenters: the Cyber Care Institute, recently introduced to four organizations and over 100 students in New York City. AI Is Undermining Our Privacy. What Can We Do About It? Robert Stribley We've been grappling with evolving issues around online privacy for years now, but the recent burst in use of AI or LLMs (large language models) has quickly introduced new and sometimes alarming privacy concerns for both users and those creating AI experiences to consider. This talk will take a look at six specific areas where AI is undermining privacy and discuss what, if anything, we can do about them. The six areas to be discussed are: lack of transparency with data sharing, accidental exposure of personal data, reversing data anonymization, deceptive design patterns, AI listening in everywhere, and malicious misuse of AI. To end on a constructive note, eight guidelines that designers and developers can follow to ensure they're focusing on privacy when working with AI will be discussed. Aphantasia: A Personal Reflection Dr. Earl Brown Imagine a mind without mental images, where "picture this" has no meaning.

He will explore its impact - both good and bad - on everyday experiences such as chess, piano, drawing, reading, memory, and learning, finally speculating on how aphantasia may affect creativity and the hacker mindset. The ARTS Open Framework Sabar Dasgupta Over the past several decades, the scientific process has relied more and more on computational analysis of data to produce digital artifacts. Fields like molecular biology, neuroscience, linguistics, and astrophysics, to name a few, have been revolutionized by this trend to the point that computational workflows are ubiquitous. Although most of these workflows are very similar at a high level - collecting data, analyzing it with code, and publishing the resulting figures - implementation details differ widely. While there exist standards such as the FAIR Guiding Principles for organizing and sharing data, there are not widely adopted standards for reliably regenerating analyses from said data, especially across compute environments. This talk presents an open framework for archived, reproducible, and transparent science (ARTS) that aims to do exactly this - by packaging data, code, and figures in containers and uploading it to a persistent, trusted, and accessible archive. Ask the EFF William Budington, Lena Cohen, Cara Gagliano, JosÃ© Martinez This year, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) will be returning to HOPE for a special "Ask the EFF" panel to address some of the pressing questions the hacker community has in these troubled times. Panelists will provide updates on current EFF work, including the ongoing case against the "Department" of Government Oversight, educating the public on their digital rights, organizing communities to resist ongoing government surveillance, and more. The panel will then turn it over to attendees to pose questions and receive insights on how users can protect their civil liberties online during an increasingly volatile political and world situation. ATM Hacking: Past and Present Roman Pushkin This talk explores the evolution of ATM hacking, from classic physical attacks to modern software exploits, using two real-world case studies. Roman will demonstrate how cybercriminals bypass security measures and why banks often stay silent. Attendees will see a live demo of a custom "flusher device" built for a tabletop coin dispenser (reverse-engineered from eBay), highlighting vulnerabilities in cash-handling systems. Back to Basics: Building Resilient Cyber Defenses for Multiple Use Cases Yael Grauer In spite of novel cybersecurity threats, digital security advice has remained largely unchanged in recent years. In fact, a lot of advice in response to high-profile attacks doesn't actually address risks people are most likely to face. This talk will analyze several high-profile digital security concerns, whether viral advice to address it would have been effective, and what steps could be taken - both before and after the issue arises. You will hear of lessons learned from years of auditing and updating Security Planner, a digital security guide that provides customized plans based on responses to a few survey questions. The presentation will further delve into ways to segment digital security advice so that it's personalized to the individual, their devices, their technical capabilities, and the type of risks they're likely to face. Bitcoin Poker: Satoshi's Lost Game and Its Decentralized Revival Mattias Bergstrom Bitcoin v0.1.5, the last version personally coded by Satoshi Nakamoto, contains curious references to poker buried in its source code. While never officially documented, these fragments suggest that Bitcoin's original design may have envisioned more than just money; it may have included decentralized, trustless gaming. This talk will explore the historical and technical significance of these lost poker references, analyzing: What was Satoshi's intent? Was this an abandoned feature, an experiment, or an overlooked function of Bitcoin's game-theoretic design? How was poker referenced in early Bitcoin? There will be a deep dive into the code archaeology of v0.1.5 and why poker may have been included. The presentation will also include the introduction of Bitcoin Poker, a modern Rust-based reimagining of trustless, peer-to-peer poker, demonstrating how we can host fully decentralized poker games without a centralized server, use multi-signature escrows for provably fair betting and payouts, ensure post-quantum security for long-term cryptographic safety, and implement a sidechain execution model to handle high-frequency transactions without bloating the main chain. Bitpart: 5-In-1 Platform for Activism Over Signal Josh King Signal is one of the most critical tools we have for secure communication amongst activists, journalists, and human rights defenders. As of 2024, Signal has over 70 million active users and over 220 million downloads, with no signs of slowing down. With the global rise of the far-right and corresponding attacks on human rights, the ability to securely organize via Signal against these forces is more important than ever. To that end, Throneless Tech has embarked on an in-depth research project that resulted in the creation of Bitpart: a Rust-based software platform that allows for the creation of dynamic organizing tools on top of Signal. Depending on the end-users' tech capacity, Bitpart can be run on organizers' own self-hosted servers or through Throneless-hosted servers. The project builds on experience gained from past Signal chatbot projects, and new research conducted with targeted groups such as current organizers, activists, and journalists around the world. In this session Josh King, developer of Bitpart, will demonstrate how the platform is being used to create bots that activists can use as secure, anonymous tiplines, digital helpdesks, broadcast lists, a tool to distribute eSIMs, and a tool to share VPN download codes. Participants will come away with an understanding of how Signal can be utilized in novel ways, how to think through the threat model and risk assessment for creating secure tools for activists, and how Bitpart can be expanded upon and applied to their own communities. Both Sides of the Wire: Surveillance, Whistleblowing, and Building a Cyber Peace Movement John Kiriakou As a former CIA officer who exposed the agency's torture program, John Kiriakou paid the price with his freedom. In addition to disclosing wrongdoing, he understands surveillance from the inside. This talk brings together that firsthand knowledge with a challenge to the hacker community: we must pursue a cybersecurity model rooted in cooperation, transparency, and peace rather than conflict. This talk will explain how today's digital ecosystems - including both software and hardware - are vulnerable not only to technical compromise but also to political manipulation. The threats we face are not just from malicious actors or hostile governments, but from within our own systems. Co-opted code, opaque procurement processes, and surveillance-by-design continue to erode public trust. It is time to reclaim the hacker ethos and direct it toward a global cyber peace movement. Here you will learn why hackers, technologists, and civil society must lead this effort, and how the only sustainable security is one built collaboratively, with integrity and purpose. Bridging the Decentralized Gap: Shared Hacker Values, Cypherpunk Roots, and the Future of Blockchains Alexander Urbelis, Phil Daian, Harry Halpin This panel will delve into the deep-rooted connections between hacker and cypherpunk culture and the evolution of Ethereum and blockchain technology, tracing their shared emphasis on decentralization, privacy, and open-source principles. By revisiting the historical context of the 1990s Crypto Wars and projects like PGP and Tor, the discussion will highlight how these early movements laid the groundwork for the vision of a trustless, user-sovereign Internet. The panel also will aim to debunk common misconceptions that associate blockchains solely with scams or speculation, showcasing real-world applications such as the Ethereum Name Service and privacy-preserving technologies, while emphasizing the ecosystem's pivot towards public goods and accessibility. Ultimately, the conversation will underscore the enduring, collaborative vision of both hacker and blockchain communities - advancing censorship resistance, user empowerment, financial privacy, and a decentralized digital future. Build a Tech Community in Your Neighborhood, One Hackathon at a Time William Hutson This talk chronicles the journey of creating a vibrant tech community through short, accessible two-hour mini-hackathons that lower barriers to participation. The speaker shares their experience of building Flushing Tech's successful bi-weekly hackathon program, and provides a practical roadmap for you to try this at home in your own neighborhood. Leave with actionable guidelines for starting similar initiatives that emphasize the importance of creating an inclusive environment that welcomes participants of all skill levels while maintaining enough technical focus to drive meaningful project development. This talk is ideal for community organizers, tech enthusiasts, and anyone interested in fostering grassroots innovation in their local area. Bureaucracy Hacking - Creating Organizational Exploit Chains for Good Adam L. Hesch At their core, all bureaucracies are, fundamentally, information systems, containing the ability to store information, compute information, and share information over a network. This means they all can be hacked. In this funny, enriching, and ultimately inspirational talk, the concept of "bureaucracy hacking" will be discussed as a way to make a difference in any organization of any size, even (perhaps most especially) when you feel like "just a cog in the machine." The talk will be suitable for a novice audience of any background, with high level references to traditional information security, hacking, and of course social engineering principles. What will make it unique and interesting will be particular emphasis on the exploitation of the emergent and unique properties of bureaucracies. It will be most actionable by young, idealistic entrants into the workforce. And, it may yet inspire the younger versions of ourselves inside each of us that our (warranted) cynicism has led us to ignore or forget (at our peril). Stories will come from the speaker's (and others') experiences at organizations like Meta, the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Navy, and others. It is intended as a rebuttal to, and toolkit for, countering "Pournelle's iron law of bureaucracy." Claw Back Your Data From Big Tech With Cyd Micah Lee, redshiftzero Tech platforms can't be trusted. Oligarchs and billionaires want you to keep giving your data to their Big Tech companies for free so they can sell it and manipulate you into believing nonsense. In this talk, the Lockdown Systems collective will introduce Cyd, their open source desktop app that makes it easy for people to reclaim control over their data from Big Tech. Giving users actual control over their data is challenging when dealing with hostile, enshittified tech platforms like X and Facebook. Cyd bypasses all of that though by putting the user in the driver's seat: it runs on the user's own computer, from their own IP address, and it works by automating a web browser on their behalf - and sometimes relying on APIs, when they're available, free, and don't suck. It doesn't share any access to your accounts or your data with the Lockdown Systems collective. Attendees will learn how Cyd works under the hood, how you can use it, and how you can contribute to building tools that challenge the dominance of Big Tech. Communication and Movement in Internet Shutdown Protests: Rethinking Mesh Messaging Cora Rowena Ruiz 2024 was the worst year for Internet shutdowns ever recorded, with nearly 296 documented events across 54 countries. Frequently imposed during protests and times of unrest, shutdowns are commonly used as a tactic to suppress dissent and restrict communication. Mesh messaging is widely hailed as a potential workaround, yet these tools are generally considered unreliable, untrusted, and ultimately go unused. Mesh systems depend heavily on the spatial relationships between nodes, but existing research on how people move and communicate in protest settings is sparse. This talk explores a holistic approach to mesh tool design, grounded in qualitative firsthand experiences to build effective blackout-resistant mesh tools. Computational Techniques for Making Karaoke Harder Jamie Brew Robot Karaoke is a live comedy show that swaps lyrics with fragments of text drawn from a catalog of esoteric datasets (quora questions, web banner ads, tax forms, and more) to create and sing never-before-sung karaoke songs. This talk covers how the data is sourced, how the songs are phonetically annotated, and how the show is run and the core software (the Weird Algorithm) developed. The presentation will end with a demo of the future of karaoke. The Computer Underground Scene - Past, Present, and Future Netspooky (Phrack / HCC), TMZ ( Phrack / tmp.Out), Skyper (THC / ex-Phrack), John Threat (Masters of Deception), Bill Budington (Electronic Frontier Foundation) This is a brainstorming session together with the audience. The panel will talk and unravel a bit about the past and present, and try to find a shared vision of where we are or should be heading. Counter-Surveillance as Activism: Using Cameras Against State Violence in Israel/Palestine Aman Abhishek Palestinian, Israeli, and international anti-occupation activists in Israel/Palestine have been using cameras to deter and document violence from Israeli security forces and settlers for around two decades. Human rights organizations first started distributing cameras in the mid-2000s to facilitate documentation, and today, essentially every anti-occupation activist in the West Bank and Jerusalem carries some combination of video cameras, smartphones, and body cameras to deter and document state-settler violence. The activists also take it upon themselves to take the videos to journalists, human rights organizations, courts, and elsewhere; recently, this activism was the focus of the Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land. This talk will describe how activists organize, what happens to the footage, how this activism changed after October 7th, and what this all means for thinking about counter-surveillance as a strategic response to state violence. Cracking Enigma: A Chronology of Cryptographic Breakthroughs Brais Macknik-Conde The Enigma machine was a sophisticated encryption device used by Nazi Germany during World War II. Its mechanical design utilized three rotors that scrambled plaintext into complex ciphertext, with additional layers of security from unique internal settings. However, inherent weaknesses and poor operational procedures left it vulnerable to cryptanalysis. The first successful attacks on Enigma were conducted by Polish mathematicians in the early 1930s. By exploiting repeating message indicators and rotor cycle patterns, they deduced rotor wirings and constructed replica Enigma machines. Their breakthroughs enabled systematic decryption until German countermeasures in 1938 forced new approaches. Alan Turing and his team at Bletchley Park refined these methods, pioneering statistical techniques and mechanical computation to accelerate decryption. Techniques such as Banburismus and the Good-Turing estimation method were created under Turing's leadership. The development of the Bombe machine allowed rapid elimination of incorrect rotor settings, enabling the Allies to decipher vast amounts of enemy communication. This presentation will focus on history and cryptography, examining how breaking Enigma provided critical intelligence that shaped Allied strategies and shortened the war by an estimated two years, saving millions of lives in one of humankind's most significant intelligence operations. CRXaminer - Deep Dive Into Chrome Extensions (Plus Tool) Mark El-Khoury You spend your time configuring HTTP headers and hardening your containers. Meanwhile your CFO just downloaded a Chrome extension to make the font in Gmail Comic Sans. What are Chrome extensions, exactly? This talk will dive into details, including format, contents, static analysis with custom rules, threat modeling (when does this even matter?), and some of the unique challenges of building a security scanner. A tool will be demoed that has just been released for this: CRXaminer (crxaminer.tech). You will learn how you can immediately start using it. Dark Web Digger: Modular Scraping for Dark Web Intel Samantha Stortz, Dominick Foti Dark web forums are a major resource for the hacking community and play a large role in the spread of information, data leaks, tools, services, and related transactions. While it is common for users to keep similar usernames and identifiers across different forums to maintain their credibility, these users often need to create or change accounts. The prototype presented here looks to tie anonymized accounts to the same user, as they will likely have similar language usage, post content, tools, tactics, and procedures (TTPs). The presenters developed a modular web scraper that can extract data from forums and store said data for analysis. They explore opportunities to leverage machine learning techniques to automate and enhance the process of cyber threat intelligence (CTI) analysis in the future. This includes using natural language processing (NLP) to digitally fingerprint users based on speech patterns, trend detection between users and forums, and even a chatbot to assist the tool's users in finding specific information. The project provides analysts with a wholistic view of how users interact on these forums, making it more functional and versatile. Data Autonomy: Counter-Surveillance Strategies for Civil Society Marlon Kautz The surveillance apparatus in the West is going critical, and civil society is not prepared for the fallout. Political leadership is explicitly targeting NGOs and social movements using surveillance capabilities that have been perfected over the past decade. This talk will evaluate the merits and limitations of different counter-surveillance approaches from the vantage point of grassroots organizers, and go beyond the stock advice of "use Signal and a VPN" to offer proposals for defeating state surveillance through technical infrastructure development and political organizing. Design for Neurodiversity: Creating Neuro-Inclusive Spaces Dorothy Howard This talk will explore the concept of neurodiversity and its implications for designing events and spaces with neurodivergent people's diverse needs in mind. The neurodiversity paradigm promotes embracing neurological differences, emerging from the autistic rights and disability justice movements of the 1990s. Accessibility guides and resources rarely focus on neuro-inclusive design. The presentation will highlight strategies for creating neuro-inclusive environments informed by research in education, including examples such as low-sensory rooms in libraries and conferences. Attendees will be encouraged to reflect on how neuro-inclusive design can benefit the communities they engage with. DIY Police Scanner With SDRs and Open Source Software nop Police accountability requires transparency, but access to relevant information is frequently hindered by collaborators in government or the police themselves. Fortunately there is one source of info we can take into our own hands: their radios. Police in the United States largely use the digital, trunked radio system "Project 25." We can listen in to this using spare computers, a few Software Defined Radios (SDRs), and open source software. Even better, we can go far beyond what very simple broadcastify-style dispatch streams offer, like having our own archives of radio traffic. Based on an actual system that sees real-world use, this talk will cover how to set up your very own DIY police scanner. Ansible playbooks and supporting scripts to streamline the process will be released, and practical tips and lessons for real-world applications of such a system will be covered. Eco-Hacking Desire: The Intersection of Pornography, Sex, and Environmental Impact Jasmin Hagendorfer This talk explores the intersection of desire and sustainability, examining how even our most intimate moments leave an environmental footprint. The concept of sexecology, coined by Annie Sprinkle and Beth Stephens, bridges environmentalism and sexuality in creative ways. From solar-powered vibrators to eco-friendly sex toys, the session delves into the often overlooked world of green sex tech and eco-erotic practices. Key questions explored will include: What are the true environmental costs of online pornography? How sustainable is our streaming culture and AI technologies? Can DIY pleasure practices be a form of political activism? What role does ethical pornography play in envisioning a better future? The discussion will also cover energy consumption, server loads, and the hidden costs behind virtual acts of desire. The focus is not to shame desire, but to empower it with awareness, curiosity, and hacker ethics. The speaker, a feminist activist and artist, aims to foster a dialogue about how digital intimacy can become more visible, accountable, and hackable. This talk invites the hacker community and beyond to collaborate in rethinking the infrastructures behind online pleasure and to explore ways of making the environmental impact of these systems more transparent. Esolangs as a Hacker Folk Art Daniel Temkin The most important computational art is happening far from museums, immersive art "experiences," and the smoldering ruins of NFT platforms. Esolangs, like demos and code golf, are hacker folk art, born entirely outside the art world, yet beginning to get wider attention as more digital artists and poets contribute to the form. This should not be a surprise with the critical work it has done to explore our relationship with technology, the politics of computing, the aesthetics of code, among many other subjects. This talk will present esolangs, not as a loose collection of language associated by algorithmic complexity, but a social history of how each language influenced the next, drawing from ten years of interviews for the blog esoteric.codes. It will look at esolangs as more than technical wizardry and consider aesthetics for this form that often pretends to eschew aesthetics entirely. Expanding the BioArtBot Color Palette - A Beginner's guide to Lab Automation and Biosafety Danny Chan bioartbot.org/ is a project for encouraging curiosity in microbiology and lab automation through creative expression. It is an open source project built on a pipetting robot that draws user submitted pixel art by placing colored bacteria on agar. Using the story of the BioArtBot development as a guide, this talk will provide a basic overview of the technologies (hardware, software, and wetware) implemented in the BioArtBot. It will describe how lab automation is used in biotech companies, how it might be used by amateur/community investigators, and how the BioArtBot is an interesting framework to contribute to if you are looking to skill-up in lab automation. It will also describe how the living pigments for this project were created and sourced, how you might create/source your own, and the amazing diversity of living chemical refineries that are bacteria. So if you're interested in robots and bacteria, come find out how we can command our tireless inorganic creations to deposit aesthetically pleasing arrangements of the ancient form-factor of all life. Exploiting Emergent Property-Based Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models David Kuszmar As AI technology expands across both benign and malicious applications, our understanding of the attack surface must evolve to account for emergent properties in complex systems. In large language models, these emergent behaviors create novel classes of vulnerabilities that are not only unpatched, but largely unrecognized. By systematically manipulating the model's limited perception of reality, attackers can induce cascading failures that go far beyond traditional filter bypasses, exposing fundamental weaknesses in the internal logic and contextual binding of these systems. This session will unpack how these vulnerabilities work, walk through real examples, and explore the far-reaching implications for AI security, governance, and safety. The Five Pillars for Rewriting History and Culture Alexander J. Urbelis, Daniel Nowak, Roel Schouwenberg From printing press to blockchain, technological advances reshape historical narratives across five pillars: finance, governance, faith, communications, and consciousness. Influential entities employ sophisticated cyber and information solutions to manipulate resources and power. Governments, corporations, and NGOs manage narratives, shaping opinion and obscuring truths as they manage perception. Religious groups use digital platforms to spread doctrine, blurring traditional faith boundaries. Social media and emerging technologies amplify disinformation worldwide. These operations exploit cognitive vulnerabilities, reshaping collective memory and fueling evolving consciousness. This talk will examine how technology-driven psychological operations can unmake historical canons, normalizing new realities and marginalizing dissent. The presenters will highlight ethical dilemmas and stress the urgent need for transparency, critical awareness, and decentralization across all pillars. Lastly, they will offer recommendations for how the individual can remain resilient in the face of these existential threats and multifaceted Manichean devils. The Free Software Movement: Where It Came From, What It Means to Me, and What It Could Mean to You Craig Topham This talk is the journey of Craig's discovery of the free software movement and how it solved his need to find a position in the fight for a better tomorrow. The hope is to inspire others to share this viewpoint of free software and to see how it is a critical factor for civilization if we want to avoid the nightmare dystopia which awaits us all if the free software movement fails. From Activism to Hacktivism: Resisting Digital Repression Gabrielle Joni Verreault, Elina Castillo-Jimnez, Jane Eklund, Ken Mayers (Moderator) This panel discussion will offer insights into the challenges faced by human rights defenders and hacktivists in today's context of intensified digital repression, including surveillance, censorship, and cyberwarfare. The three panelists will report from the frontlines, sharing their technical expertise and experiences living among activists and supporting them in their work in different countries. Topics will include hacktivism in Ukraine, disrupting surveillance in Serbia and Thailand, and tech and reproductive rights in the USA and worldwide. Each panelist will briefly share their stories and insights, and then the discussion between them and the audience will be opened. The Future of Email Is Open Dejan Å trbac, William Lessard Email is one of our most essential tools, yet it's controlled by a handful of corporations that scan, monetize, and gate-keep our communication. In this talk, the presenters will introduce OpenEmail, a ground-up re-imagining of async communication built on a radically simple, open protocol. Designed for privacy, integrity, and interoperability, OpenEmail combines end-to-end encryption; decentralized delivery; and a public, extensible architecture to give users true ownership of their communication, and developers the freedom to build on top of an open social protocol. They will explore how a spam-free, surveillance-free inbox, where messages are trustworthy by design, can reclaim the Internet as a space for open, human connection, free from Big Tech. More than just a talk, this is a call to arms: to take back control of our communication and build a digital future that serves people, not profit. Getting Out of DOGE: A Discussion With a Former DOGE Engineer Adam Klasfeld, Sahil Lavingia The whole world has been watching as the "Department of Government Efficiency" (DOGE), the partnership between Elon Musk and the Trump administration, has worked to fulfill its pledge to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government. Despite promises to the contrary, there has been very little transparency about DOGE or its operations - until now. Join Adam Klasfeld, a former MSNBC legal contributor and founder of All Rise News, as he interviews Sahil Lavingia, a former DOGE engineer. This discussion aims to reveal what DOGE is really doing behind the scenes and offer the public a unique chance to ask direct questions to someone who was there. Hackers Got Talent Jason Scott It just wouldn't be HOPE without another installment of "Hackers Got Talent." This is an opportunity for hackers from all around the planet to show off their talents in this cheeky display of hacker (and totally non-hacker) skills. Just sign up at InfoDesk and the talent you decide to share is entirely up to you. (Seriously, anything you're good at is a talent.) Hacker archivist Jason Scott will again be on hand to keep everything moving. Judging will be done by a combination of panelists and audience members. First place wins a valuable prize! Second place... we'll see. Hacking for Social Justice Danacea Vo "How can my hacking skills become a force for advancing social justice?" Those who ponder this question often know what they're up against - oppression, inequality, enshitification.... But the path toward building meaningful change can feel unclear or overwhelming. This talk draws from years of experience working alongside activists, human rights defenders, and digital organizers, and offers a practical framework for lasting, meaningful change. You'll gain social impact strategies that will help you align your technical skills with the movements and communities you care about. If you've ever felt the call to do more - with purpose, with clarity, with community - this is your invitation. Hacking Search: Kagi's Revolt Against the Ad-Tech Machine Vladimir Prelovac You know the drill: search for official travel info, get an overcharging third-party site. Look for a hotel, get a misleading aggregator. "Free" search costs you time, money, and trust. Kagi is the revolt - a paid, obsessively user-centric search engine architected to serve you, not the advertisers. This session reveals how Kagi sidesteps the surveillance model, leveraging diverse sources and AI tools (under your control) to deliver clean, customizable results. Founder Vlad Prelovac will detail the tech choices enabling genuine user agency (blocking SEO garbage, elevating trusted sources via filters), the challenge of building viable alternatives outside the ad-tech ecosystem, and the fight to restore user agency against data-hoarding monopolies. If you're tired of being the product on the web, join the resistance. Hacking the Future at Tesla Science Center Michael Caprio, Jeffrey Velez, Ed Wilson The year 2026 marks the 170th birthday of Nikola Tesla and will also be the year that the grounds of his Wardenclyffe laboratory will at last open to the public. Learn about the latest goings-on from Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe detailing their visitor center renovation and opening; development of their amateur radio station and radio club; expansion of their public and educational programming with space science courses, events, and hackathons; a future hackerspace; and more exciting projects! Hacking the Tech-Industrial Complex: Learning to See Invisible Systems Seth Godin The author of more than 20 international bestsellers gives us an inside view of the systems that drive our culture. Every dominant system works to maintain itself, and we can find strategies and stories that push to make things better. Hack the Violin Part 2: The Advanced Stuff - This Time There's AI Andrew Morican, Ebmbat This is a follow-on from "Hack the Violin: A Hacker's Approach to Learning, Playing, and Teaching the Violin" from Hope XV. This will be a look at technology, most notably AI and hacking the violin. You will learn what's out there and what the presenters were able to achieve with their own AI project regarding practicing and engagement. You will also learn about AI with live performance and creation, as well as AI and string sampling - and see how sampling may be altering the stringscape. Hardware Hacking Meets Art: How Movie Special Effects Are Made Davis DeWitt Step into the world of movie magic with Davis DeWitt, a filmmaker, inventor, and former Mythbuster and learn how combining hardware hacking with art creates objects that do more than function: they evoke emotion and tell stories. From blowing up cars to building robots with personality, this talk will explore why it's important to tackle projects that blur the lines between disciplines. HOPE_16 Badge - No Badge, No Problem Victoria Joh, Vinicius Fortuna Electronic badges have become a focal point of hacking conferences and key to growing the immersive conference experience! This talk will provide a brief history of electronic conference badges, as well as discuss the good, the badge, and the ugly from the speakers' attempt at a new and improved production run this year. Sadly, while there will not be a new production of the improved HOPE badge in time for the con to be shared with HOPE_16 attendees, this will still be a lively discussion of everyone's favorite badges from past hacking conferences. The design and production challenges that inevitably cropped up will be discussed in detail. The struggle to produce a working badge aligning both funding and functionality is real. This year has been no exception, with various uncertainties such as tariffs and geopolitical norms at play. Despite the challenges, many lessons have been learned. This is an opportunity to plan for a future run, share experiences with others, and get more interested individuals to join the team and get involved. How a Handful of Location Data Brokers Actively Track Millions, and How to Stop Them Bill Budington, Lena Cohen In the past year, a number of investigations have revealed the outsized role of a few select companies in gathering, storing, and selling the location data of millions of devices - and by extension people - worldwide. These companies largely use technologies which power the online advertising industry in order to collect and disseminate this data. To make matters worse, this data has been both provided to private investigators on the mere assurance that they plan to work with law enforcement, and has been subject to data breaches which put the privacy of millions at risk. This talk will elaborate on the technologies, data flows, and industry players which comprise this complicated ecosystem. Most importantly, it will cover some basic steps you can perform to protect yourself against the wide array of location privacy harms your device subjects you to. The presenters will show tools and techniques they've developed to allow users to take back ownership of our devices, rather than our devices owning us. How I Used and Abused LLMs to Get Top 250 on HTB Rambo Anderson-You This talk explores an experiment in giving AI system-wide access to compete on Hack The Box (HTB). The talk details the development of a semiautonomous workflow for capture the flag (CTF) competitions, involving jailbreaks, LLM switching, and hardware. Through iterative diagrams, the talk traces how the workflow evolved as the AI improved at capturing flags. This presentation considers how this CTF solving AI slop might extend to real world scenarios like penetration testing, red teaming, and bug bounty hunting. How Law Enforcement Agencies Compromise Entire Encrypted Chat Platforms Joseph Cox Law enforcement agencies compromising entire encrypted communication platforms to read peoples' messages is no longer an outlier. It is the new normal. That includes the FBI taking a tech startup called Anom and inserting its own backdoor, French authorities pushing a malicious update to tens of thousands of EncroChat devices, European cops hacking another company called Sky, or any of the increasing number of related cases. In this talk, Joseph Cox, co-founder of 404 Media and author of Dark Wire will detail police tactics, pulling from his nearly ten years of covering the encrypted phone industry. How to Be Positively Transgressive: Hacking Culture for Good Johannes Grenzfurthner (monochrom) In an era where transgression has been co-opted by reactionary forces, how can we reclaim subversion as a tool for positive change? Historically, countercultures, hackers, and artists have used disruption to challenge power structures, expose hypocrisy, and expand the boundaries of what is possible. Yet today, the same methods - culture jamming, media pranks, and ideological infiltration - are increasingly wielded by ultra-right movements to erode democratic values and spread reactionary narratives. This talk will explore how we can re-hack the hacker mindset: How can we use transgressivity in ways that are constructive rather than destructive? How do we subvert without merely burning things down? Can we retool the aesthetics and tactics of countercultural rebellion to push society forward instead of backward? Through historical examples, personal experiences, and a healthy dose of mischievous strategy, this talk will try to outline actionable ways to engage in cultural hacking that disrupt oppressive systems while reinforcing community, inclusivity, and progressive values. Because giving up on the tools of subversion means surrendering the battlefield. And that, phreaky phriends, is not an option. Human Augmentation: Hacking Human Perception and Performance With Technology: Benefits and Dangers Lucas Potter, Xavier Palmer, Vivekanand Pandey Vimal Human augmentation is the idea of using technology to hack, alter, and enhance human perception and performance. Imagine being able to enhance your ability to navigate by sensing the flow of magnetic fields like a pigeon. Many industries are starting to explore human augmentation, such as space (enhancing astronauts), medical (rehabilitation), entertainment (greater immersion), military (greater performance), among others. In the first presentation, Dr. Vimal will begin by providing an overview of psychology and neuroscience research on the topics of human augmentation. Then he will share his own NASA-funded research on using sensory augmentation as a countermeasure for spatial disorientation. What dangers could arise from building a bridge between human and sensory augmentation devices that have the capability of altering human perception? This question will connect to the second presentation of the panel, where Dr. Palmer and Dr. Potter will explore how human augmentation connects to security through biocybersecurity followed by Q&A. ICEBlock and the Age of Digital Activism Joshua Aaron Learn how ICEBlock has empowered over a million users nationwide to report immigration and customs enforcement activities anonymously, despite government pushback. Discover how you can use your tech skills to drive change and advocate for causes you believe in. Plus, stick around for a Q&A session where you can interact directly with the creator! This talk will be remote due to the targeting of the speaker by the current administration. Into the Fediverse Evan Prodromou One third of Americans say that social media has negatively impacted their mental health. Almost two thirds say that social media has been bad for democracy. But the majority of us still use social media on a daily basis. We clearly need better social media - enabling user choice or even platforms built and run by the users. The Fediverse is a coalition of social networking platforms that connect together, letting users interact across platforms while maintaining their independence. Evan is one of the authors of the ActivityPub standard that drives the Fediverse. He will discuss how the Fediverse went from a dream to a reality, and how individuals and communities can start exercising control over their own social platforms. Invisible Ink of Compression XlogicX When you pop the hood of RFC 1951 (DEFLATE), there lies an interesting playground that would be otherwise unseen in the context of compression use cases. This talk will address many aspects of the ubiquitous DEFLATE compression, none of which involve compressing data! "Designer Compression" scenarios will be explored, such as blocks of DEFLATE data that can be fully ASCII printable, contain no data, buffer underflow access of nulls, and even apply forms of recursion. We will also see forensic data extraction from compressed fragments, employ difficult to detect watermarking, demo a covert channel PoC (deflate in http), and forever-cookies. The presentation style will take a high-level first pass and then dig into the technical details with the time left. Itinerant Signal Institute (Rite of Spring) Amelia Marzec "Itinerant Signal Institute" is a project that leverages open source technology to examine and communicate about land use. As we move into an era of potentially increasing climate migration, the project aims to create a network of sensors that test environmental toxins. It examines the effect of local emissions on global climate change, using small devices that test the air and soil. That information is then shared via a portal. Imagery for the project will include ritual costumes that mark the changing of seasons. The project began with visits to polluted locations in New York City, including Governors Island (a former military base) and Newtown Creek (one of the most toxic waterways), and working with the Urban Soils Institute to collect information for the project. Leading and Survival When TSHTF - A Lighthearted Look at the End of the World George Sandford There's a moment when you realize that yes, everything may actually be on fire. As individuals, we can collapse, or we can take action to at least increase the odds of a positive outcome. As leaders (managers, parents, friends), we have to hold it together, fight to create safe spaces, keep our teams motivated, and somehow find time for self-care - without letting an active adversary turn us into the human equivalent of burnt toast. This talk will explore the art of leading in the midst of chaos, drawing on a punk ethos, irreverent humor, and a sprinkling of practical advice. You'll see how to preserve diversity and inclusion when everything feels like it's falling apart, how to support your team without losing your mind, and why it's okay to cry in the shower (just not every day). Media, Vibe Coding, and the Long Tail Lydia Laurenson What is even happening in the media now? There's a resurgence of paper magazines, and now they reach a long tail of subscribers due to the powers of the Internet. At the same time, social media platforms are downgrading in complexity and Signal chats have somehow become the new social media conversation. Everything old is new again, and it's all combining and recombining with weird emergent politics and independent vibe coders. This will be a discussion of the future of media, especially as seen within alternative cultures and the weird Internet. Meshtastic Attacktastic Dave "Heal" Schwartzberg In emergencies or off-grid scenarios, Meshtastic shines, but it can crumple when adversaries go off-script. Meshtastic is an open-source platform that allows for long-range, off-grid communication through LoRa-based mesh networks. While offering powerful tools for decentralized communication, particularly in remote areas or during emergencies, Meshtastic also introduces a set of security risks that could be exploited by adversaries. This talk explores the potential vulnerabilities within Meshtastic networks, focusing on attack vectors such as physical attacks, privacy leaks, key management, and jamming. Additionally, the effectiveness of the platform's encryption and authentication mechanisms will be analyzed, offering insights into how these systems can be compromised and how users can fend off attackers. This session will include a technical breakdown of known vulnerabilities and present both simulated and real-world examples of attacks on Meshtastic networks. Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of how to defend against these threats, hardening their mesh networks against malicious actors. Whether you're a hobbyist experimenting with off-grid communications or a security professional assessing decentralized systems, this presentation will equip you with the tools and knowledge to secure your Meshtastic devices. New Journalism: Reimagining Information Networks From the Ground Up Patrick Boehler This presentation explores how communities are developing resilient information-sharing systems that outperform traditional journalism. Drawing from research on independent journalism in China, Patrick will examine how these organic networks function as advanced social technologies that challenge conventional understanding of information distribution. The talk invites the HOPE community to reimagine information infrastructure that can withstand authoritarian control, resist corporate manipulation, and genuinely serve community needs through collaborative problem-solving and the application of security expertise in distributed systems. Not Your Private Army: On the Trail of Cyber Ops Emma Best During the past two decades, hacktivist spaces have been infiltrated and co-opted by hostile interests, ranging from state actors to political and corporate entities and entitled oligarchs. This talk examines how these outside parties have attempted to build private cyber armies and task forces through the recruitment and exploitation of gray and black hat hackers. Special focus is given to the "Anonymous" brand, Western state actors, and the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. NymVPN: The First Real-World Decentralized Noise-Generating Mixnet for Anonymity Harry Halpin Nym is the first decentralized noise-generating mixnet to provision real-world network anonymity to Internet users even against nation-state adversaries. The aim here is to supersede existing VPNs in order to fight increasingly more powerful authoritarianism and surveillance. Unlike traditional centralized VPNs that can be de-anonymized by a global passive adversary - like the NSA - based on their traffic patterns, Nym adds noise ("cover traffic") to existing Internet communications. Similar to Tor, Nym routes each packet separately over a decentralized network of servers, but unlike Tor, mixes traffic and adds noise at each hop. After being introduced at HOPE five years ago, NymVPN has now shipped. NymVPN is an easy to use app for all major operating systems that makes using the Nym network as easy as using a traditional VPN for ordinary people, with both a "fast" and "anonymous" mode. The "fast" mode features speeds comparable to centralized VPNs using the same decentralized network as the mixnet, but without mixing. Via the SDK, the Nym mixnet remains free to use by hackers to build the next generation of privacy infrastructure. Off-Grid Data Running in Oppressive Regimes: The Pirate Box Project (and Sneakernet!) LambdaCalculus In today's political climate in the U.S., the Internet as we know it is in danger of becoming heavily monitored, privatized, and censored. Information may only be what the corporations and government want you to see, and it may become difficult for marginalized and poor communities to have access to free information and education that the Internet provides. But by building an off-grid, mesh networked system known as the Pirate Box, it'll become a pivotal way of being the data runner your community needs. The Pirate Box is a form of Sneakernet, and this talk will give you a brief overview of both, as well as strategic tools and ways to make a Pirate Box of your own, along with projects in the spirit of the Pirate Box. Offworld Voyage: Can Training for Mars Exploration Also Address Human Adaptation to Climate Biodevastation on Earth? Scott Beibin Elizabeth Jane Cole This talk will present the design philosophy behind Offworld Voyage, a decentralized science initiative that develops ecologically sustainable training habitats for use in simulated Mars surface exploration missions - while also solving for adaptation to extreme climate change on Earth. The Offworld Voyage M.A.R.S. Tesseract Space Analog Simulation Habitats were designed with a zero waste ethos for minimal environmental impact by inventor Scott Beibin and Michael Flood. The modular and portable structures of the habitats include: a bio-dome for cultivating organic vegan plant-based and fungi-based nutrition sources, autonomous power production, advanced waste reclamation, a science laboratory for experimentation and research, a space medicine bay, a fabrication lab for prototyping and repair, facilities for fitness and creativity as well as a kitchen and living quarters. Mission immersions incorporate a vision of the future when space has become accessible to all through the use of emerging ecologically sustainable appropriate technologies enabled by new types of egalitarian economic structures and coordination methods. Crew activities include EVA explorations in pressurized space suits outfitted with bio-sensors, 3D printed construction using regolith, utilization of open source communications tools, cooperative governance exercises and the practice of mutual aid and consensus decision-making in mission planning, problem-solving and self-sufficiency challenges in the face of extreme resource scarcity, simulated time-delayed communications, and experiments to analyze the effects of isolation on astronauts during offworld missions. The inaugural mission for the M.A.R.S. Tesseract habitats will occur in a remote desert location in late 2025. It will include the founders of the project, Scott Beibin and Elizabeth Jane Cole, who are both alumni of the Mars Desert Research Station (Mission 286) and core committee members of The Journal for Space Analog Research. Future plans for the project include the development of pressurized facilities and closed loop systems, as well as development of public goods including hardware and software for Space Analog Research and S.T.E.A.M-based educational programs. Packets Over Any Wire: Alternative Networking Mediums for Hackers Haxedalot Why limit yourself to Ethernet and Wi-Fi when every wire in your house can carry packets? This talk explores alternative physical networking technologies that exist but are often overlooked. From powerline networking (HomePlug AV/AV2) to MoCA over coaxial cables, the talk will dive into how these systems work, their encryption and security models, known exploits, and the inherent risks of non-switched cable mediums. Real-world applications, including whole-home audio and video distribution, network segmentation strategies, and the unexpected advantages of leveraging existing infrastructure will also be explored. You'll see how HDMI matrices, IP-based video distribution, and networked audio solutions like SonosNet can integrate seamlessly over alternative backbones. Segmentation techniques to isolate security cameras will also be covered. Expect deep technical insights, practical lessons from years of experimentation, and a fresh perspective on what's possible when you stop thinking of cables as just power or TV lines - and start treating them as network highways. Whether you're looking to expand connectivity in a complex environment or just want to push the limits of home networking, this talk will leave you with new tools, techniques, and ideas to explore. Phrack Magazine #72 - 40th Anniversary Release Party Netspooky, TMZ Celebrate 40 years of legendary hacking with Phrack Magazine! Netspooky and TMZ will be dropping a special hardcopy release of their magazine, packed with cutting-edge research, underground insights, and tributes to decades of digital rebellion. Don't miss this milestone issue - crafted by the hackers for the hackers. Free, of course, as always. Grab your copy, meet the crew, and honor the zine that defined an era. The talk will explain a bit about Phrack's history, how it all started, and where it's going - the vision of the new editorial staff and how Phrack is changing. You will get a rare insight into what it takes to run an underground hacking magazine. You'll learn what it's like to work with the many authors, reading and fixing articles, dealing with obscure submissions, and what it takes to get your article accepted and become an author in Phrack. For the first time ever, a "secret challenge" has been included in the hardcopy magazine for you to find and to solve. The prize for the winner will be revealed at the talk. Piracy Is the Past, Present, and Future of Streaming Abigail De Kosnik, Benjamin De Kosnik Official ratings of TV viewership and box office revenues for films never tell the whole story of how people access popular media texts and instead promote platforms or corporations. Many millions around the world consume media through unofficial channels, especially peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing networks. In this session, you will be introduced to alpha60, an ongoing research project with six years of TV and film distribution data that reveals trends and oddities in global media desire. The speakers will present data on the quantity, timing, and location of downloads for major television series and films, offering data on unofficial global audienceship and speculating on new insights about cultural circulation, transnational belonging, and fandom. Planning a Project That Has No Budget Travis Southard Projects are notoriously hard for developers to manage even with project managers, budget limits, and deadlines. Often in hacking and civic tech, we are our own PMs, funders, and timekeepers, which means projects can simultaneously have no budget and unlimited budget. Since a community is not paying for a particular feature, they have no "I think we've reached where we want to stop spending" moment, so when is something done? It doesn't cost our coworkers to ask for more features, so when are they asking too much? Travis will talk about his experiences as a professional nonprofit legal aid developer and as a volunteer project lead to explore what's helped him when working with nebulous conditions around specific requirements. The Political and AI Singularity Are Inevitable - Or Are They? Roel Schouwenberg America's transition from a literary society to one shaped by social media and AI has revolutionized how we communicate, process information, and engage politically. AI's conversational nature deepens this shift, influencing culture and cognition. This talk will explore these new realities and provide insights into how to navigate them. The Present and Future of Online Discourse Harper Reed Today's technologies greatly empower individuals and groups, while simultaneously creating tremendous risks to freedom and privacy. How can major forces like big tech, artificial intelligence, and political governance be guided towards pro-social outcomes? What can individuals do? Is there hope for social media to heal divisions, rather than amplify discord? These and other topics will be addressed during this lively and far-ranging presentation. Print, Build, Fly, Heal: 3D-Printed Autonomous Planes for Medical Delivery in Rural Mexico Dana Gretton, Jaguar Kristeller This talk focuses on a project with medical students in Alamos, Sonora, Mexico to develop affordable delivery drones that can get urgent medical supplies to remote communities. What currently takes days to reach by mule through mountainous terrain can hopefully be accomplished in minutes by air. This talk chronicles the evolution from off-the-shelf hobby planes to locally-built, 3D-printed aircraft capable of autonomous waypoint missions. The speakers will discuss the technical choices behind their current $1000 prototype (and how they plan to cut costs in half), alongside the organizational structure they're developing to sustain this work. Recently, they established "club guilas" with local medical students - one of whom has completed pilot training for the test aircraft. The biggest challenges faced aren't the technical ones, but rather organizational sustainability: how to transition from a project driven by visiting engineers to one owned and operated by local communities. Plans will be shared for creating a federated network of university clubs, and the blueprint for a lean nonprofit structure to support them. PrivacySafe and 3NWeb: Engineering User-Centric Digital Sovereignty Mikalai Birukou We want to control the technology we use, and we want to trust it. At the same time, we expect it to be convenient. 3NWeb is a groundbreaking framework that gives users full control over their digital interactions across devices, while preserving privacy and independence from centralized systems. Grounded in core principles like the principle of least authority (PoLA) and web-style federation, 3NWeb reimagines how services should operate in a user-first Internet. This presentation includes a demo of PrivacySafe, a client-side 3NWeb platform that is real, downloadable, and ready to use today. Its careful implementation raises meaningful questions from a range of perspectives: users, organizational administrators, application developers, and service providers. The session will address practical considerations and continue with in-depth conversations in the hallway track. PrivacyTests.org: Web Browser Leak Testing Arthur Edelstein PrivacyTests.org is an open source privacy audit of popular web browsers. The project subjects web browsers to automated leak tests and regularly publishes the browsers' test results head-to-head on a website and on social media. The goal of PrivacyTests is to encourage all web browsers to mend their ways and comprehensively protect everyone's privacy. By thoroughly exposing the leaks in web browsers, the website helps users choose a more private browser, and thereby puts pressure on browser makers to fix their privacy leaks. In his talk, Arthur will give some details about the project's approach to testing and presenting test results, and show how browser privacy has evolved over the past four years. Quantum Computing and AppSec: Preparing for the Post-Quantum Threat Sheshananda Reddy Kandula Quantum computing is poised to disrupt modern cybersecurity. With the potential to break widely used encryption algorithms, such as RSA and ECC, quantum threats pose a significant risk to web applications, APIs, and secure communications. This talk provides an introduction to quantum computing for application security professionals, outlines the threats to current AppSec practices, and explores how organizations can begin transitioning to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Attendees will leave with an understanding of the timeline, tools, and strategies required to prepare for the post-quantum world. The Quantum Curtain Ed Ryan High technology has taken on a new meaning. As AI technologies grow increasingly creepy and quantum computing catches major headlines, the U.S. government is scrambling to cover its posterior. Recognizing that these technologies pose a significant security risk, the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security has imposed export controls on AI and quantum computing technologies in an attempt to limit their spread. This talk will discuss the history of export restrictions, touching on cryptography and the Playstation 2, before moving on to explain the new restrictions and their implications for those working in impacted fields. The idea of a "deemed export," which limits who is even allowed to learn about certain technologies, will be addressed. QWK Packets and the Muffled Spark Jason Scott A deep dive into the QWK packet - a revolutionary addition to the Bulletin Board Experience of the 1980s - and the ramifications of what it represents in a very changed world. RDP Spray and Pray: Research on Modern RDP Attacks From Spray to Exploit Tess Mishoe RDP has been around the block for a while. Since 1998, admins shudder at the mere mention of port 3389. It's anything but old-hat, though - even today, there are a lot of active attack methods and adaptations for the modern world. This talk will be going through the world of RDP attacks from the perspective of an attacker, a defender, and us - the researchers and engineers. Some mass RDP attack data will be showcased, along with how to identify, label, and further prevent these attacks in the future. A Red Team Exercise 2025, 15 Years Later Tom Brennan, Vladislav Gostomelsky, Logan Klein This presentation is about red, blue and purple teams, along with the rest of the rainbow. Dig in for a fun and interactive presentation where the panel threat models and then attacks people, process, and technology. Bring your creative thinking and defensive skills and try to stop the... hackers. rim: Reclaiming Personal Data Sovereignty in the Age of Wearables Dana Gretton, Jaguar Kristeller As we approach a future where body-worn devices capture increasingly intimate biometrics, the question of who controls that data has never been more urgent. This talk introduces rim, a techno-social vision and set of protocols challenging the standard model of cloud-based data extraction by building tangible, person-to-person systems for storing and sharing potentially intimate live data streams, innovating at the edge of taboo to expand human connection while preserving privacy and autonomy. There will be a demonstration of early prototypes of wearable devices implementing an "SD-core" aesthetic and detailing the technical underpinnings of protocol concepts including data "dissolution" and "crystallization" with erasure coding and intermittent connection tolerance. Beyond technical implementation, the presenters will discuss how this paradigm shift creates space for entirely new forms of human-to-human connection at the boundary of what's technically possible and socially acceptable. The Shape of the Legal Battlefield for InfoSec Professionals at Work Ken Vedaa It is no secret that sometimes there can be tension between InfoSec professionals and the organizations that they work for. Security professionals spend their days (and sometimes nights and weekends as well) buried in the dirty laundry that others pretend does not exist. These tensions can bubble up in unexpected ways. As an InfoSec professional, what are the common legal concerns that you need to be aware of at work? How do these challenges change over time? What should you keep in mind when considering a new job? A Sleuth's Stories on Detecting and Revealing Large-Scale Research Fraud Mu Yang In this talk, the speaker will share how they stumbled into this work by accident and what it's like to operate as a scientific sleuth within academia. The bulk of the presentation will focus on real-world cases of research fraud and misconduct, spanning fields from neurodegenerative diseases to chemistry, physics, and materials science. The talk will, through these examples, explore: the techniques and tools used to detect irregularities; how issues are reported to journals and publishers; the distinction between honest mistakes and deliberate manipulation; the collateral damage caused by misconduct, including its impact on public trust in science. The final section will examine the social and economic drivers of research fraud - and outline the systemic changes needed, globally, to break this cycle and restore integrity in science. Small Budget, Big Protection: Cyber Defense for SMBs Robert Wagner Small businesses often face significant challenges in defending their organizations with limited budgets. This talk will provide valuable insights into budget-friendly approaches to long-standing cybersecurity issues, helping small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) improve their security posture without excessive costs. Attendees will learn how to navigate the delicate balance between driving digital innovation and managing the risks of cyber threats and data breaches. Obstacles that prevent smaller companies from accessing affordable security resources will be explored along with practical solutions to overcome these hurdles. Many smaller organizations make the mistake of focusing solely on technology to solve their security problems, neglecting crucial aspects like people and processes. This talk will emphasize the importance of a holistic approach to cybersecurity, sharing strategies that larger companies have learned over decades. By understanding and implementing these strategies, SMBs can avoid common pitfalls and effectively raise their security standards. Attendees will leave with actionable tips on improving their cybersecurity practices within a limited budget, ultimately enhancing their overall defense capabilities. Solving My Identity Crisis Dr. Phill Hallam-Baker Traditionally, Internet accounts are controlled by the service providing them. There is no 'number portability' for email addresses. Switching costs discourage service changes. Recently, Bluesky has disrupted this model and 32 million users now use account names based on the Internet identity infrastructure, DNS - names that users can register and control directly through DNS handle providers. This presentation will describe three standards proposals extending this approach. @nywhere extends the authentication approach to allow DNS handle accounts to be used at any Internet resource, not just those running ATprotocol. @nyone combines the DNS handle approach with JSContact to provide account portability and secure exchange of credentials for end-to-end secure communication. @nything allows network connected devices to become true Internet things with an Internet DNS name, WebPKI credentials, and using @nywhere and @nyone to support access control. Spooky Action at a Discount: DIY Meshtastic Nodes Kody Kinzie To anyone interested in off-grid communication at a low cost, Meshtastic allows even beginners to communicate with (or control) devices from miles away. Thanks to applications in emergency communication, sensor monitoring, and censor-proof encrypted chat, Meshtastic is exploding in popularity even as the cost for making nodes is going down. This talk will cover the basics of Meshtastic, setting up and customizing nodes, plus outlining the tips and tricks to building affordable custom Meshtastic nodes, learned from building custom Nibble Meshtastic nodes for the conference. Attacks against Meshtastic and issues observed in the wild will also be covered. Expect to learn about LoRa, Meshtastic node and antenna options, how to deploy nodes for specific applications, attacks against Meshtastic, and how to join larger mesh networks in your local area! StickTock.com: An Open-Source Alternative in the Age of Digital Protectionism Sean O'Brien The threatened U.S. ban on TikTok represents a turning point in global digital policy, reflecting the rise of "data tariffs" - restrictions on the movement of information modeled after traditional trade barriers. While concerns over privacy and national security have fueled the decision, the move also aligns with economic protectionism that benefits domestic tech giants. The fallout from this policy shift could further fragment the global Internet, leading to retaliatory restrictions against American firms and diminishing access to diverse digital platforms worldwide. In response, privacy advocates and open-source developers have taken action. StickTock.com is a free and open-source frontend for TikTok, designed to allow users to access and share TikTok content without invasive tracking, advertisements, or the need for a proprietary app. Built by the team at PrivacySafe, StickTock.com is hosted in Iceland - a jurisdiction with strong commitments to Internet freedom and privacy. Their mission is to demonstrate that digital independence and free speech can thrive in the face of restrictive policies. This talk will delve into the development of StickTock.com as a case study in open-source innovation as a means of circumventing censorship and preserving privacy. The challenges of building privacy-first digital alternatives, the broader implications of government-imposed digital barriers, and the future of decentralized platforms will be explored. In an era where the free flow of information is increasingly under threat, open-source solutions offer a critical pathway toward digital resilience and user autonomy. The Struggle for Connection in a Fragmented World: Rebuilding Third Spaces Jack Gangi Third spaces - those vital, informal gathering places between home and work - have long been central to hacker culture, but they're vanishing. This talk will explore why third spaces matter more than ever for connection, creativity, and counterculture, and how we can rebuild them in a world increasingly fragmented by gentrification, digital monopolies, and social isolation. From hackerspaces to IRC to local meetups, Jack will trace our roots and offer ideas for rekindling authentic community, both online and off. Systems of Dehumanization: The Digital Frontlines of the War Against Bodily Autonomy Daly Barnett This presentation covers the years of security research and surveillance investigations that Daly (a senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation) has done on the various threats facing movements for bodily autonomy. She covers the bad Internet bills that made sex work more dangerous, the ongoing struggle for abortion access in America, and the persecution of trans people across all spectrums of life. These issue-spaces are deeply connected, and the digital threats they face are uniquely dangerous. Come to learn about these threat models, as well as the cross-movement strategies being built for collective liberation against an authoritarian surveillance state. Things You Wish You Knew About Software Testing Dan Nagle Everybody agrees that software testing is important, but how does one actually go about accomplishing this efficiently? Here is a presentation about testing that has actual examples, immediate tools that can be used, and some really interesting and unexpected ways that code can break. This is a fast moving presentation discussing techniques in a way that both coders and non-coders can learn. Tips on Living Life in Interesting Times Mitch Altman What motivates us to do what we do? How do we find meaning in doing it? What makes us choose what we choose? Can we do better? What is important? Can we thrive and feel excellent, regardless of particular outcomes? These questions may now be more pressing than ever in our most interesting of times. Throughout our lives we tend to go with the flow of what is happening, making choices by default. Where do those choices come from? In the face of the rapidly changing and challenging times that we live in, personal and political, social and economic, can we find motivation to do what we do? Can we actually improve anything? Can we find and maintain enthusiasm to move forward into the unknown and feel good about our choices, regardless of outcome? Mitch will draw from lessons learned (and re-learned), doing his best to face the challenges while often haphazardly wandering through his 68 years on the planet. This talk will attempt to address these existential, important questions that we all face (whether consciously or not). Top Ten: Democratic Open Source Software Defined Radio and Amateur Radio Applications That Matter Today Steve Bossert A major benefit of the widely used open source Git platform is every project is voted on by its followers, making selection easy for what is the most popular and worth paying attention to. This presentation focuses on the top voted applications focused around software defined radio, as well as amateur "ham" radio. Time only permits the top ten to be covered. This is a great way to showcase how diverse these two crossover topic areas have become in recent years. Some projects are purely software-based while others are a mix of open source hardware plus software. High level coverage of these amazing projects will be included, but will be explored in more depth as part of a separate hands-on workshop during HOPE_16, making this presentation a must attend for anyone interested in radio-related topics! The Trials and Tribulations of Building Your Own Phone Wesley Appler (aka lamemakes) Over the last two decades digital surveillance has become baked into our daily lives. Your current and past location, who you're in contact with, habits/interests, sensor data, and a trove of other personal information is constantly being sent to third parties by the smartphone that is nearly always carried on us. What would it look like if we reconsidered the mobile phone entirely, putting extra emphasis on privacy and intentional disconnection via open source hardware and software? This talk will follow Wesley's journey to do just that, starting at the conception of the idea, getting acquainted with mobile networks/operators, obtaining proprietary datasheets, designing hardware, failed/successful prototypes, the current state of the project (along with demos), and how any interested parties can get involved. Turning Leaks Into Leads With OCCRP Aleph Ezana Ceman, Klil Eden You've got a leak, a name, or a suspicious company. What's your next move? In a world where corruption thrives in the shadows, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) provides the infrastructure to bring truth to light. At the core is Aleph, a powerful data platform built to help investigators follow the money and uncover complex networks across diverse sources. Bring your own data or explore the presenters' - the OCCRP data team collects and curates four billion records from nearly 200 countries, ranging from corporate registries and sanctions lists to court filings and leaked documents. This session will walk through how Aleph powers live investigations, transforming raw, chaotic data into structured insights that expose the actors and assets behind fraud and abuse of power. Designed by journalists, researchers, and developers on the frontlines, Aleph is more than a tool - it's a global community working together to uncover the truth. What will you find? Unearthing Air Todd Whitney Breathing polluted air is an unfortunately common human experience. Yet even as particulate matter settles in our lungs and occupies our minds more than ever, most of us lack the words and abilities to create better breathing environments. This talk will invite the HOPE community to develop personal and proactive approaches to the air we breathe by bringing it down to earth. Air is invisible, but very material and personal. This talk demonstrates hacking opportunities in the tools we traditionally use to sense, measure, and make air make sense. The presenter will dive into communication tools like the air quality index, open source sensors, and the emerging ethics of community air quality monitoring. Importantly, everyone will come away with fresh frameworks and tools they can use to begin designing their personal pollution priorities. When the Lawman Comes Calling - Government Data Demands and Online Platforms Fred Jennings Drawing on over a decade of experience, this talk will first introduce the statutes, rules, and concepts governing law enforcement requests for user data, ranging from basic subpoenas to secret FISA search warrants. From that foundation, the discussion will cover practical steps that web services and individual users can take to reduce their legal attack surface, minimize their risks, and maximize their protection from invasive data disclosures. Zodiac Killer Marketing: How I Used Codes, Cyphers and Nefarious Means to Launch a Covert Food Business Chef Adam Sobel During the pandemic, Adam launched Galactic MegaStallion, a new vegan food business, but decided traditional marketing was boring and morally icky. Instead, he created an elaborate system of codes, cyphers, a mysterious hotline, and strategically (and illegally) placed billboards that led curious people to find his food through coordinates. This presentation will cover how and why he developed this unconventional marketing approach, and how breaking traditional marketing rules and business conventions actually built a delighted customer base. HOPE_16 Closing Ceremonies Nothing lasts forever and that even applies to HOPE (the conference, not the concept). We will reminisce about what happened this weekend as if it was a decade ago. And we can guarantee there will be many fun stories to share. If you're really lucky, you'll get to help us clean up!

Title: Wells Fargo Warns Fed Rate Cut and Additional Catalysts Could Trigger Pullback for Group of Assets – Here’s the Bank’s Outlook

Banking titan Wells Fargo is unveiling a scenario that could trigger a correction for artificial intelligence (AI)-focused stocks. In a new CNBC interview, Chris Harvey, the head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, says investors are skeptical about the sustainability of stock market rallies after equities rebounded in a massive way from the April lows. Rather than a pullback, Harvey expects the stock market to consolidate as he sees the Fed cutting rates in the coming months. “A lot of people are looking for a pullback. They are talking about things being overextended. They’re talking about uncertainty with the Fed, and earnings and lions, tigers and bears, oh no. I don’t know what the short term holds. I think we could see a consolidation. It’s really unclear for me, but the underlying fundamentals: still strong. We do think the Fed will certainly have to be dovish in the next couple of months, and what we also think is that rates are going to rally because the deficit, in all likelihood, while not going to be good, will probably be better than expected based on some of the tariff news that we’re getting.” Looking at the tech sector, Harvey warns that a string of good news could hurt the AI trade. He notes that a more favorable macroeconomic landscape could stimulate risk-taking behavior and encourage investors in AI stocks to seek higher gains in other sectors. “One thing I think that could potentially hurt the AI trade is if you do get the Fed cutting, if growth is better than expected, if rates do come down, suddenly the contrarian trade starts to look better, and you could see rotation. And I think that’s the biggest fear for AI right now.” Popular AI names include Nvidia, AMD, Palantir, Microsoft, Meta and Google.

Title: What Analysts Think of Microsoft Stock Ahead of Earnings

Time Published: 2025-07-27T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
Microsoft (MSFT) is scheduled to report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell today, with Wall Street resoundingly bullish on the software giant heading into the results. All 20 analysts covering Microsoft tracked by Visible Alpha have a "buy" or equivalent rating for the stock. Their consensus price target around $580 implies 13% upside over Tuesday's close just above $512, after setting a record high Friday at $513.71. The shares have added about a fifth of their value in 2025 so far, hovering around $512 in recent trading. Wedbush, which has Microsoft on its "Best Ideas List," recently raised its price target to $600. The company "is just hitting its next phase of monetization on the AI front," Wedbush said, thanks to the adoption of Copilot, its chatbot, and the cloud-computing platform Azure. Revenue from Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Azure, is expected to grow 22% to $28.96 billion, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Citi analysts have called Microsoft their "top pick," giving it a price target of $613. The bank said Microsoft has pricing and margin power that is "nearly unmatched in enterprise software." Jefferies analysts issued a price target of $600 earlier this month. Analysts on average expect Microsoft to report quarterly revenue of $73.86 billion, up 14% year-over-year, and net income of $25.27 billion, or $3.38 per share, compared to $22.04 billion, or $2.95 per share, a year earlier. Wall Street will be watching for updates on Microsoft's AI spending ambitions in fiscal year 2026, which began this month. In April, CFO Amy Hood said capital expenditures are expected to grow this fiscal year, but at a slower rate than in fiscal 2025. Microsoft at the time said it expected $80 billion of capex in fiscal 2025. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) last week raised its projected 2025 capital expenditures to $85 billion from $75 billion. Rival hyperscaler Meta (META), like Microsoft, is set to report earnings after the bell today. Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) are slated to follow tomorrow. UPDATE—July 30, 2025: This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent analyst estimates and share price values.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has sold 6.6 million shares worth around $1.5 billion, according to a filing with the US SEC. The sale, executed just days before Amazon's Q2 earnings release, follows a steady pattern of disposals under a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. Since late June, Bezos has offloaded nearly $5.7 billion in shares. He plans to sell up to 25 million more by mid-2026, while also donating millions to charity. His total share sales since 2002 now top $50 billion. (Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Title: The S&P 500 is ‘extremely concentrated,’ Apollo economist says, warning the best AI investment may not be in the Magnificent 7
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/07/25/sp500-magnificent-7-pricing-apollo-economist-torsten-slok/
Time Published: 2025-07-25T17:35:59Z
Full Content:
Sasha Rogelberg is a reporter and former editorial fellow on the news desk at Fortune, covering retail and the intersection of business and popular culture. It’s time to question the soundness of continued zealous investment in the Magnificent Seven, one top economist warns. The S&P 500 has become “extremely concentrated,” with the top 10 stocks contributing 54% of market returns since January 2021, Apollo chief economist Torsten Sløk said in a Friday blog post. With the cluster of tech stocks at the top beginning to unravel, he is pouring cold water on continued aggressive investment in the index and in the Magnificent Seven. “The textbook idea that the S&P 500 gives you a diversified exposure to risk is just simply no longer the case,” Sløk told Fortune. “You are very focused and concentrated in a small group of names, in particular in tech, making up such a significant share of your overall risk exposure.” The top 10 companies in the S&P 500 now prop up 40% of the index’s market capitalization—more than 30% of which is from the Mag Seven—meaning the fortune of the markets has become increasingly reliant on investor optimism about AI. Alphabet’s AI rally not only helped mint CEO Sundar Pichai as a billionaire, for example, but the Google parent’s earnings beat gave the S&P 500 its fourth consecutive record close on Thursday. But as the AI bubble swells larger than the IT bubble a quarter-century ago, as Sløk has previously noted, the extreme hype around the technology risks creating even broader economic consequences than the dotcom crisis. To protect one’s individual investments, now is the time to reconsider pouring money into the Mag Seven, Sløk argued. “One should have some exposure to the S&P 500 and should certainly also have some exposure to AI,” Sløk said. “But it’s very clear that [owing to] the market’s extreme focus and concentration on this story, this is the time to have a conversation around, What are the things I should be doing with my money?” Mounting concerns over the ramifications of a growing AI bubble coincide with the unraveling of the Magnificent Seven stocks. “We’re beginning to have conversations about the ‘Magnificent Six,’ maybe it’s only five,” Sløk said. “This is also just telling you that the Magnificent Seven are seven very, very different companies that have very different businesses.” Popularized in 2023 by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett, the “Magnificent Seven” term acknowledged a group of companies alike in their goal of pushing toward an AI future, but these seven firms, once in lockstep, are beginning to diverge in their levels of success and areas of investment. Apple, for example, has lagged behind competitors like Microsoft and Meta in developing AI products and services. With its stock down about 12% year to date, some market watchers have called for CEO Tim Cook to step down, despite Cook’s boosting the stock price by nearly 1,500% over the past decade-plus. Tesla has meanwhile failed to deliver on promises of autonomous driving, continuing this week its streak of sales misses and disappointing quarters. Tesla’s stock has fallen nearly 15% in 2025 as investor confidence in CEO Elon Musk continues to be tested. Nvidia this month became the first publicly traded company with a more than $4 trillion valuation as its stock price surged by approximately 1,460% over the past five years. The company is expected to see strong sales growth, despite increasing competitive pressures. Ahead of next week’s earnings reports for Meta, Apple, and Microsoft, analysts are continuing to scrutinize the pricing of these companies’ stocks, assessing if there are other options in the tech sector worth buying into. “AI will continue to have a dramatic impact on all our lives,” Sløk wrote in his blog post. “But the question remains whether the Magnificent Seven are correctly priced, and if they will even be the best AI investments over the next five to 10 years.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Calls to replace Tim Cook as Apple CEO are getting louder every quarter – analyst

Update font size. Reset A Wall Street analyst advises caution on Apple stock due to the company’s unclear artificial intelligence strategy, particularly in generative AI. Needham’s Laura Martin warns that Apple risks lagging behind Big Tech competitors if it doesn’t clarify its AI approach, potentially jeopardizing Tim Cook’s job. Patrick Seitz for Investor’s Business Daily: ‎ “Apple must articulate a GenAI action plan,” Martin said in a client note Friday. “Apple is 1-2 years behind its Big Tech competitors, so any GenAI plan will be expensive to catch up through higher costs to the P&L and higher capex, and maybe even an acquisition.” Further, if it doesn’t act, tech talent will leave Apple to work for big players in artificial intelligence such as Meta Platforms, OpenAI, Anthropic and others, she said. “We believe that Apple’s share price will fall once investors understand the investment levels required to catch up with the other Big Tech conglomerates that were early adopters of GenAI,” Martin said. Lack of a clear AI strategy could even cost Chief Executive Tim Cook his job, she said. “Press and Wall Street’s calls to replace Tim Cook as Apple CEO are getting louder every quarter that Apple doesn’t lay out a comprehensive GenAI strategy,” Martin said. “With Apple shares down 14% year to date (vs S&P 500 up 8%), it’s clear to us that investors are insisting that Apple get off the sidelines.” ‎ MacDailyNews Take: Not loud enough, yet. ‎ Please help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.

Apple won’t get serious about fixing itself until it can figure out how to do so by way of obnoxious leftwing virtue signaling. Analysts always conveniently dish up anything they like to account for stocks going up or down. In this case the analyst conveniently ignores the effects on Apple stock of tariffs imposted by the tangerine tyrant. If the haters want to get rid of Tim Cook the path forward is easy for them. Buy up a majority of Apple stock and vote him out. Calls getting louder …. predictable. That is what whiners do. No facts required. The guy that many here pushed as a candidate to lead Apple is currently presiding over an implosion in his company, with stock plummeting 21.7% so far this year, with no turnaround in sight. He’s also a known drug addict, philanderer, and had a major falling out with the POTUS. This beleaguered cyte has a worse track record than Steve Jobs in picking effective long term leaders. The other guy some other out-of-touch people keep bringing up was an arrogant ass who, after bungling Maps and blaming others, finally got himself canned. No other tech firm hired him, and he’s been out of the industry for many years. Sorry but production of a play doesn’t quite impress on a resume for someone who wants to run a multinational corporation. Who’s the “known drug addict, philanderer and faller-out?” It sure appears TC is the subject, but you’re bringing news with those nouns. Let’s not forget; in addition to the “many here,” Jobs picked The Cyte (is that supposed to be derogatory?) and both figures have effectively been the leaders of the once richest co of the World. You don’t like Mr. Broadway either. Prescience and brilliance almost requires you make public who the next, best and inevitable leader is to be? Who’s a whiner? I’m not a fan of The Cell either, btw. I think he was referring to Musk, since before the anti-Cook campaign here , MDN spent ridiculous amount of time lionizing the dude. Not sure why anyone would follow that wacked so-called genius. That “wicked so-called genius” is building rockets to Mars. Now tell us, Mr. Genius, have you done anything compared to that? Moron. Musk, the man with conviction that many seem to dislike, IS a genius. To say otherwise and to besmirch him displays allegiance to a paradigm despite his achievements of excellence. Space-craft, AI, motor vehicles, land boring/infrastructure, disability solutions, financial solutions, community media. Reported recently is his following the puck, with purchase of an energy company. AI and some crypto services will require energy needs way beyond current supply. What a dummy, he is. Except for Boring (which I don’t understand as revolutionary), his pressing the boundaries in EVERY one of his business, but you’re disturbed by an entity “lionizing” him. I have a feeling you might be suffering from The Syndrome? Did your Musk antipathy coincide with his partnership with the Orange-Man Bad’s campaign and perhaps were tickled before with his clean-energy magic carpets? Meanwhile carnage of AAPL’s forays into advance tech litters the horizon. BUT, Apple Pay remains and its capturing the the World. It’s only a matter of time before he goes. However the question arises as to how much more damage he will cause to the company its innovation and product line. It’s not just Tim Cook who needs to be replaced.he’s populated the senior positions with those who seem to lack the vision for innovation and are content to keep on leveraging the revenue from an existing product range until it runs out Nokia Ericsson Motorola etc the difference is Steve jobs and Johny Ive gifted Cooke a range of products to play with so he can continue the game longer. It’s time to go now and he should show some respect for the customers and investors. Investors are fluid individuals and may be willing to extract as much value as long as the party lasts before moving on. Pity this company and brand has a long way to go with the rights leadership As an add on maybe it’s time to invite Elon Musk on to the the board of apple get rid of the woke nonsense get back to basic innovation and brain storming and sideline the Oscar’s as this seems to be Tim Cookes main driver. Is it worthy of celebration the F1 is scoring well at the box office but apple intelligence and Siri are completely stalled?Just look at the headlines on Macdaily for the last month how many refer to movies and tv shows this website is not Variety it’s a site promoting a technology servicing company – many will say this is not what apple is but whatever Tim Cook has tried to create because of his distaste of innovators and lack of understanding it’s not a film and to business. Ti Musk can’t even focus on his own company. No way that Apple’s core base would support him. Nor can Tim Cook be a least Musk is innovative as a board member he’ll galvanise it or rallies it better than sinking out of inactivity intrangience and a complete lack of understanding of what’s needed TIM COOK: “LIKE COLBERT SAID TO TRUMP…. GO FSCK YOURSELF!” Why so angry! This is what’s wrong in the World now. If you are this angry about a forum disagreement the rest of you life must be miserable. It is clear that Apple needs new direction from a Product Guy not a Logistics Guy! There has been some innovation but not in the right places. Tim likes movies and TV shows not computers.

Written by Asif Ali You want more customers, and you’re ready to advertise your business. But how should you do it? There’s Google Ads. Instagram. Flyers. Billboards. TikTok. And dozens of other online and offline options. Some deliver better results than others: But that doesn’t mean they’ll work for you: You have to find the right channels for your business, not just the ones that are popular. At the agencies I’ve worked with, I’d often see small businesses like auto repair shops and restaurants boost ad returns by 50-200% — just by switching to better-fit channels. In this guide, I’ll help you pinpoint the winning channels for your business — the ones that can unlock real revenue potential. I’ll go through it step by step in three phases, covering: And I’ll show you exactly how I’d do it if I had a starting budget of $500. Note: Want a quick list of ad ideas? Grab this free sheet with 30 ways to promote your business. There are dozens of channels you can use to advertise your business. But unless you have a lot of time and budget, you can’t be everywhere. In this phase, we’ll find out which ones are actually worth testing for your business. I’ll use a local furniture store as a running example. But you can follow the same steps no matter what you sell. Let’s start with the step most people skip: If you’re short on time and want results fast, paid ads can absolutely work. But that doesn’t mean they’re the best move right now. Think of it like this: Ideally, you’d do both. Paid gets you quick wins, while organic builds trust and visibility in the long run. But when you’re working with limited time and budget, you’ll need to choose: (Check out our ultimate SEO tutorial to get started with organic marketing.) If you’re ready to move forward with ads, let’s lock in your #1 goal. You can’t run effective ad campaigns until you know what you want it to achieve. Your goal decides everything, from where you advertise to what your ad looks like. One goal = one outcome = one high-converting ad. Not “get more attention.” Not “build awareness.” We’re talking actual business outcomes, like: Can ads do more than one thing? Sure. But when you’re starting out, trying to get five outcomes with one campaign just spreads your budget thin and hurts your ROI. So pick one. Ask yourself: “When someone sees my ad, what’s the one action I want them to take?” Let’s say I run a local furniture store. I’m not trying to sell sofas online, I just want people to visit the showroom. That’s my goal, and everything in the ad should lead there. Make yours just as clear (and measurable). Pro tip: Use the SMART framework to help you choose the right goal. Before you spend a dollar, look at how your last 20-30 customers found you. Because chances are, your next customers will come from the same places. Here’s how to do it: You’re looking for repeat mentions, or anything that stands out. For example: If 12 out of 30 found you on Google? That’s a sign to use Google Ads. If multiple people say they found you on Instagram? That’s your sign to create ads on Instagram. If you don’t have the answers yet, start collecting data now. Ask every new lead: “How did you hear about us?” Track the next 30 manually. Write each one down in Google Sheets or Docs. Here’s what that might look like for my local furniture store: Note: If you’re a brand new business with zero customers, clearly you won’t have any data yet. You can still use advertising channels, but your market research and competitor analysis (see below) will become even more important. Your competitors are already advertising. Which means they’ve already spent time and money figuring out what works. So instead of guessing, reverse engineer them. Here’s how it might look for my local furniture store: One competitor sends weekly promo postcards. Another runs billboard ads on the freeway and has flyers at the nearby mall. That tells me they’re spending heavily on local print and outdoor ads (and likely getting results from it). I won’t copy them blindly. But I’ll take notes: Then I’ll go online. I’ll start by manually checking if my competitors are running ads on major platforms. Many ad platforms have public ad libraries you can search. Like Google’s Ad transparency, where I can see if my competitors are running ads on Google Search, Google Shopping, and YouTube: I can also look up their Instagram or Facebook ads in Meta’s Ad Library: TikTok, LinkedIn, and Pinterest have similar ad libraries. I’ll go to each one manually and check what they’re running. If I want to save time and go deeper, I’ll use a tool like Semrush’s Advertising Research. I simply plug in my competitor’s domain and instantly see: All the keywords they’re bidding on in Google Ads and how much they’re paying per click: The exact text they’re using in their ads: And what landing pages they’re using in their campaigns: To analyze competitors’ display and social ads, I’ll use the AdClarity App. It shows how much they’re spending and how visible those ads are: It also shows what kind of ad creatives they’re using: Both tools give me a sharper picture of what’s working in my niche. If I’m researching just one or two competitors, I’ll stick to manual checks. But if I’ve got five, seven, or more? I’ll use Semrush. It saves time, and it surfaces details I’d miss on my own. Once I’ve gathered everything, it’s time to look for overlap: Let’s say two of my top competitors are running Google Ads for “recliner sofa,” and both are pushing showroom visits in their CTAs. That’s a clue that these ads drive in-store visits that lead to sales. Or maybe I notice all three competitors are mailing out seasonal promo postcards. That’s not something I planned to do. But if everyone’s doing it, there’s probably a reason. This is how to use competitor data to narrow down which channels are actually worth testing. Pro tip: Use our free Google Ads competitor analysis tool if your rivals are using search ads. Before you finalize your three channels, sanity-check them. Just because a platform is popular doesn’t mean your audience is paying attention there. You need to use what you know about your ideal customer’s habits to spot the right fit for your business specifically. For instance, for my furniture store, let’s say I know that most of my buyers are homeowners in their 40s or 50s shopping for higher-ticket items. (Ideally, you’ll have internal data to help here, but tools like Semrush can help here with their demographics feature.) Based on that insight, they’re probably searching on Google, browsing Facebook, checking mailers, and listening to local radio. Not scrolling Snapchat or TikTok. So I’ll cross those off my list, and I’ll focus on the ones that match how they already consume info. To validate that, I’ll use Semrush’s Audience Intelligence app. The tool’s Online Habits report shows when my audience is most active and how likely they are to use each social network. Meanwhile, the Media Affinity report shows which offline sources (e.g., newspapers, radio, and magazines) they pay attention to. It also shows what kinds of online media they prefer: If I see strong signals around Google and local news (but nothing for Instagram or YouTube), I know which channels belong on my list. That way, I’m picking channels based on actual behavior, not assumptions. You’ve done the research. Now it’s time to lock in your top three channels. Pick channels that line up with your goal, your audience’s behavior, and what’s already working for others in your space. And make sure they fit your budget. For example, some competitors can afford to run full-page ads in The New Yorker, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Or they may run radio ads that can cost up to $1400 for a 30-second spot, depending on the state. That’s fine if you’ve got the budget and it’s where your target audience is reading or listening. But if not, skip it. Remember: in this guide, we’re working with a $500 test budget. For my furniture store, I’m going with: Write yours down. These are the first three channels you’ll test. Need help choosing your three ad channels? We put together a detailed prompt you can upload to Claude, Gemini, or ChatGPT. It’ll ask you a few questions, then suggest three ad channels that fit your business, goals, and budget. It’s not a replacement for manual research. But it can help you move faster, with a starting plan that actually makes sense. Download the prompt file and drop it into your LLM tool to get started. Note: This works best with reasoning models. In this phase, you’ll choose what to promote, craft your offer, build the ads, and launch your first campaign. Here’s what this process looks like at a glance: I’m working with a small $500 budget, and I’m treating this as a live test. The goal: get your ads live, see how people respond, and make sure everything runs the way it should. Before you build anything, learn how your three chosen channels actually work. You don’t need to master everything. But you do need to know: That’s how you avoid beginner mistakes to launch campaigns that achieve positive ROI. (And save you from wasting time and money.) Let me walk you through the three channels I picked. Google search ads appear when someone actively searches for something you sell. For example, I can bid on the keyword “buy recliner sofa queens.” This way, whenever someone searches this phrase, my ad might appear. Google search ads follow the pay-per-click (PPC) model. You only pay when someone clicks on your ad. These are great for local businesses. Why? Because they let you show up right when someone’s actively looking to buy. But to make them work, you need to know the basics, like: Further reading: How to Use Keyword Match Types in Google Ads In my example, I also chose Facebook for one of my channels. But Facebook and Instagram both use the same Meta ad platform. So I can run one ad and show it on both platforms if I want. Instead of targeting keywords (like Google Ads), you can reach people based on: You can choose from image ads, videos, carousels, or Stories. Meta lets you set your own budget and charges you per result (like per click, impression, or DM). Before you run your ad, there are a few things you should understand to ensure good ROI: Postcard campaigns are straightforward. You create a physical card, choose the delivery area (like ZIP codes or neighborhoods), and send it to local homes through a provider like USPS Every Door Direct Mail or FedEx. But to get real results, you need to understand the fundamentals: This is one of the simplest ways to advertise your business locally if you’re trying to drive foot traffic fast. Some channels are simple. Like designing a flyer and dropping it off. Others take more time and practice to get right. Like running Meta ads or setting up Google Ads campaigns. You don’t need to master every feature. But you do need a handle on how your chosen channels actually work. That way, your campaign isn’t based on guessing. It’s grounded in real data. That’s why I’ve put together a free resource library with guides for all major channels. This will help you get up to speed with how each channel works. Download the free resource library with curated guides for popular ad channels. Don’t try to promote everything all at once. When you focus on one product or service, everything gets easier — from writing the ad to measuring results. Pick something simple, proven, and easy to sell. Ideally: For my furniture store, I might go with loft chairs. They’re popular and high-margin. And one of my competitors is promoting them in Google ads: You can test other products later. But for your first campaign, keep it focused. Even the best ad won’t work if there’s no reason to act. That’s what your offer does. It gives people a reason to click, call, or visit now — not “later.” Great offers are: For my furniture store, I’ll offer “25% off all loft chairs until Sunday, June 22, while stock lasts.” Like this competitor does: It’s clear. It’s specific. And it makes people move. A lot of small businesses don’t want to cut into their margins. That’s totally fair. There are plenty of other ways to make your offer feel urgent, without lowering your price. You could offer: Write down your offer clearly before you move on. This is what you’ll build your ad around. Every ad needs one clear next step. Click. Call. Visit. Book. Not all four. Just one. For my furniture store, I want people in my showroom. So across Google Ads, Facebook, and postcards, the action would be the same: to get directions to my store. One of my competitors does this with Google ads: Whatever action you choose, make it obvious. This is where it all comes together — your channel, your offer, and your CTA. Now you decide the ad format, write the copy, and choose (or design) the visuals. For my furniture store, I’m running three ads across three channels: Google Search, Facebook, and postcards. On Google, I’ll keep it tight. The ad will match what someone’s searching for. Like “recliner chairs near me.” The headline? Something like: “20% Off Loft Chairs – This Week Only.” The description line makes it actionable: “Visit our showroom in Queens. Free parking. Sale ends Sunday.” No fluff. Just keywords + urgency + next step. On Facebook, I’ll go visual. I’ll use a clean image of the actual loft chair in a styled room. The headline might match the offer (“20% Off Loft Chairs”) and the text could highlight one feature. Like “Reclines fully, fits small spaces.” The CTA button would be something like “Get Directions.” Like this: For postcards, I’ll design it around simplicity. Large product photo. Bold offer right up top. Short subtext that reinforces the benefit. And the bottom section will show store hours, our address, and a small map. No matter the channel, the roles of each part of your ad are the same: If anything’s vague, crowded, or trying to do too much, it gets ignored. So before you launch, ask yourself: If the answer isn’t yes within 3 seconds, it’s not ready yet. But if it is ready, it’s now time to work out how to get the most out of your ad budget. Not every advertising channel costs the same to get results. And not every channel works the same way. That’s why you don’t want to split your $500 evenly. Instead, think through each channel using three simple questions: Let’s walk through my setup. For my ads on three channels, here’s how I’d split the budget: Google Ads: $250 People are literally searching for what I sell. So the intent is high — and I want to show up. But clicks cost more here. $1.11 is the average cost per click for a keyword like “buy lounge chair.” Just to give you a sense of scale: If I spend $250 at $1.11 per click, I’ll get roughly 225 clicks. (This is an estimate. CPC is an average, not a fixed price per click.) And if just 5% of those people visit the showroom, that’s 11 visits. That’s why I’m putting the biggest share of my budget here. It costs more to show up, but the intent is also higher. And that makes it worth testing. Facebook Ads: $130-$150 I can reach local homeowners for less on Facebook than I can on Google Ads. These ads aren’t as targeted by intent, but they’re great for visuals and awareness. I’ll test a couple of versions to see what lands. Postcards: $100-$120 These have a flat cost with no bidding to worry about. I’ll send around 500 cards to homes near the store and track if anyone brings one in. This will cost me approximately $115 to print at FedEx. Will this split be perfect? No. But that’s not the point. You’re not trying to get every dollar “right.” You’re testing to see which channel shows real promise. Then you can double down in the next round with more data, more confidence, and better returns. You’ve built the ads. You’ve set your budget. Now it’s time to launch. And when you do, launch everything at once. Here’s why: If your Google ads go live on Monday, your Facebook ads on Wednesday, and postcards land the week after, that’s three different tests. You won’t know what’s working and what’s just a matter of timing. Launching all campaigns within the same 1-2 day window gives you a clean read. Same market. Same conditions. Real signals. That means: And once they’re live, don’t touch anything. No tweaking. No pausing. No panic edits. You’ll optimize later. In the next phase, you’ll learn how to track the results and double down on what’s working. Note: Setting up and launching your first ad campaign takes time. It has a steep learning curve and can feel overwhelming. Here are a few things that’ll make it easier: Your ads are live. The budget’s spent. This phase is simple: Check your results, keep what worked, and fix or cut what didn’t. Over the next few steps, you’ll learn how to track, compare, improve, and reallocate budget across your three channels. This will help ensure your next ad campaign achieves better ROI (and avoid you wasting money). Don’t try to measure everything. Just focus on the one action you wanted each ad to drive. For my furniture store, here’s what I’m tracking: Log your results in a simple spreadsheet, and check once a day for 14 days. Two weeks should give your ads enough time to generate meaningful data for this small $500 budget. Here’s how my spreadsheet might look: Ad platforms generally provide detailed campaign reports that show metrics like clicks, impressions, cost, and more. Like Google Ads: And Facebook: If you’re running offline ads, they’re harder to measure. But here’s what I’ve seen work: You don’t need a fancy tool — just a clear record of what happened. Because you’ll need that data to figure out what paid off, and what didn’t. We’ll get into that next. You’ve seen what happened. Now it’s time to make sense of it. Ask this question: Was this ad worth my money? Let’s say, for my furniture store: Let’s say 10 of those visits turned into customers, and each sale averaged $350. That’s around $3,500 in revenue from a $500 budget. If I have a 30% profit margin, that’s $1,050 in profit. This isn’t deep analytics. It’s a simple check to understand your ROI. Later, as you test more channels and scale up your spend, you’ll want better tracking systems. But for your first campaign, this level of insight is enough. Next, we’ll figure out why certain channels didn’t perform and what to do about them. Some ads hit. Some didn’t. That’s normal. The important part is knowing why. Because a low-performing channel doesn’t always mean it was the wrong channel. It might just mean the message was off. Or the audience was too broad. Or the offer didn’t land. In my experience working with clients, there are four main reasons an ad doesn’t perform: Go back to your underperforming ads and assess them against these factors. Write down where the breakdown likely happened. And don’t just look at what failed: do the same for what worked. For my Google Search ads, here’s what likely helped: For my postcards campaign, here’s what may have held it back: Don’t guess. Use your campaign data to spot friction and fix it before the next round. Your sprint 1 campaign is done. Now it’s time to level up. You’ve seen what worked. You’ve seen what didn’t. Here’s what you’ll typically do in the second sprint: In my case, for my next cycle, I’ll: And I’m going to increase my budget to $1,000. Because now I know what works, I’m comfortable putting in more. Eventually, as every subsequent sprint improves based on data, we’ll optimize our ads even further. And with that, our ROI will go up.
