Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Strategy chairman Michael Saylor, a vocal promoter of Bitcoin, stoked renewed chatter among crypto circles with his recent enigmatic tweet. Thursday’s message stating merely “Bitcoin is Calling” left many asking if a forthcoming significant purchase looms. The company recently acquired 3,450 Bitcoin at a price of $285 million. This was done after a short one-week break from their consistent acquisition pattern. Strategy has been steadfast in its aggressive acquisition strategy despite the fact that nearly all of its crypto acquisitions since November 18 have been made at higher-than-current market prices, according to reports. Saylor’s post might be a tease regarding another future purchase, given his history of sending such sarcastic remarks ahead of new acquisitions. The post also appeared to urge his 4.2 million followers to purchase BTC, which he has frequently called “the future of money.” Bitcoin is Calling. pic.twitter.com/0jo19Qbr5q — Michael Saylor (@saylor) April 17, 2025 Strategy’s shares have trounced the performance of America’s largest technology stocks, Saylor’s Wednesday filing showed. The crypto-focused firm has posted an astonishing 130% gain over the last year. These returns more than dwarf the returns of Tesla (57%), NVIDIA (30%), Apple (17%), Meta (4%), and Alphabet (2%). There is a @Strategy to beat the Magnificent 7. pic.twitter.com/TlD57hW0w0 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) April 15, 2025 Some top tech firms actually lost value during the same period. Amazon and Microsoft saw drops of 2% and 7% respectively. These comparisons highlight the significant rewards Strategy has reaped from its heavy crypto investment strategy. The chairman of Strategy has issued some provocative comments on BTC in recent weeks. Only two weeks ago, he asserted that the price volatility of the top crypto asset actually proves its utility instead of constituting a disadvantage. When someone brought up Bitcoin’s link with risky assets, Saylor contended this is so because Bitcoin is “the most liquid, salable, and accessible asset on the planet.” A day earlier than that remark, he underscored Bitcoin’s singular status among commodities by noting that there are no tariffs on it. His remark highlighted its digital nature and liquidity as central to what makes it functionally decentralized. Saylor has established himself as one of Bitcoin’s most vocal proponents. His tweets tend to center on the fact that there are only 21 million coins in existence, which he recently referred to as “the most important number in finance.” He has also likened Bitcoin to chess, although the meaning behind this comparison wasn’t elaborated in coverage. The chairman’s most recent statement comes as Strategy maintains its focus of continuing to buy Bitcoin for the long term, no matter what happens in the short term. With the company’s shares outperforming technology giants and Saylor’s ongoing public support, most crypto observers are now looking to see if another significant purchase of crypto comes after his cryptic “calling” tweet.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: AppLovin (APP) Under Pressure: Analyst Downgrades Follow Short Seller Barrage, Investor Lawsuit – Hagens Berman

April 18, 2025 14:36 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, April 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Just months after basking in the glow of a meteoric 700% stock surge, fueled by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence technology and burgeoning ad business, AppLovin Corp. (NASDAQ: APP) is facing a shift in sentiment on Wall Street. Several prominent investment banks have significantly lowered their expectations for the stock following the release of multiple critical reports from short-selling firms about the mobile advertising technology firm. Adding to its woes, AppLovin is now facing a securities class action lawsuit. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Analysts Downgrade APP Shares The latest blow came on Friday, April 11, when The Goldman Sachs Group slashed its price target for AppLovin from a lofty $500.00 to a more sobering $335.00. This downgrade followed a similar move by UBS Group earlier in the week, when the firm reduced its price target on AppLovin from $630.00 to $450.00. Short Seller Onslaught: Allegations of Data Exploitation and Inflated Metrics These downward revisions follow a barrage of critical reports from short sellers. Most recently, on March 28, Muddy Waters Research alleged that AppLovin's ad technology "systematically" violates app store rules by "impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs" from major platforms to deliver targeted ads without user consent. The report also claimed a significant churn rate among e-commerce advertisers, contradicting company statements. Earlier, in February, Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research had also critiqued AppLovin's AXON software, with Fuzzy Panda later urging the S&P 500 committee to exclude the company due to alleged "data theft" and "revenue fraud." Securities Class Action Alleges Misleading Statements Adding to AppLovin's challenges, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against the company. The lawsuit alleges that AppLovin misled investors about the capabilities of its enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and its "cutting-edge AI technologies." Specifically, the lawsuit claims that AppLovin created a false impression that its technology would efficiently match advertisements to mobile games and expand into web-based marketing and e-commerce. However, the suit alleges that AppLovin was instead exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices, including a "backdoor installation scheme," to force unwanted apps on customers. This allegedly inflated installation numbers and, consequently, the company's profit figures. The class action lawsuit further points to the short seller reports released on February 26, 2025, which detailed AppLovin's alleged reverse engineering and exploitation of advertising data from Meta Platforms. These reports also claimed that AppLovin utilized manipulative practices to artificially inflate ad click-through and app download rates, such as self-clicking ads and employing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads. Following the release of these reports, the price of AppLovin shares reportedly fell by more than 12%. Hagens Berman’s Investigation Prominent shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the claims. “The allegations detailed in the short reports and outlined in the recently filed class action complaint, detailing the purported exploitation of user data and manipulative installation schemes, raise serious questions about the integrity of AppLovin's reported growth and the accuracy of its disclosures to the investing public,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Title: Meta's antitrust trial heats up: Here's what we learned in week one
URL: https://qz.com/meta-ftc-antitrust-trial-week-1-zuckerberg-1851776650
Time Published: 2025-04-18T18:06:00Z
Full Content:
In week one of the Federal Trade Commission’s blockbuster monopoly trial against Meta (META-1.69%), CEO Mark Zuckerberg spent around 10 hours on the stand as the agency questioned him about revealing emails from another era. This trial is only just getting started. Throughout it, the FTC will argue that Facebook engaged in a “buy or bury” ploy to eliminate its rivals and gain monopoly power in the social media market. Meanwhile, Meta will make the case that it is responsible for its acquisitions’ runaway successes — and that even after buying Instagram (in 2012) and WhatsApp (in 2014), Meta still faces formidable competition from the likes of TikTok and YouTube (GOOGL+1.23%). At stake is Zuckerberg’s $1.27 trillion social media empire; if the FTC gets its way, Meta will be forced to give up Instagram and WhatsApp, eliminating “up to half of its ad business,” Jasmine Enberg, vice president and principal analyst at eMarketer, told Quartz earlier this week. The research firm expects Instagram alone to represent 50.5% of Meta’s U.S. ad revenue this year. Instagram and WhatsApp are both critical to Meta’s continued growth as legacy social app Facebook loses momentum with young people. Read on for a look at some of the key takeaways from the trial’s first week, including Zuckerberg’s old emails and the price Meta reportedly tried to pay to avoid the trial altogether. “The FTC kicked off the case with the biggest witness on its list. Only one other witness, the FTC’s economics expert Scott Hemphill, is slated to spend anywhere near as long on the stand as Mr. Zuckerberg,” Holland & Hart antitrust attorney Paul Swanson said in an email to Quartz. “Yet while the FTC confronted Mr. Zuckerberg with cringeworthy emails about Facebook’s schemes to beat back competition in the 2010s, none of that hit the key question: Is Meta currently maintaining a monopoly by virtue of the Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions?” According to Swanson, the agency didn’t get the “critical testimony it needs to show that Meta dominates a narrow market that excludes other social media platforms like TikTok and LinkedIn (MSFT+0.24%).” Swanson added, “Mr. Zuckerberg deftly described a market in which Meta’s power is checked by competition from those companies.” In one example, Zuckerberg argued on the stand that Meta’s “growth slowed down dramatically” due to the rise of TikTok. In another comment, he said he thinks “people spend more time on YouTube than on Facebook and Instagram combined, certainly more than either one independently.” The FTC brought in old emails sent by the Meta CEO, and in one message Zuckerberg floated the idea of spinning off Instagram. He wrote at the time, “As calls to break up the big tech companies grow, there is a non-trivial chance that we will be forced to spin out Instagram and perhaps WhatsApp in the next 5-10 years anyway.” Zuckerberg added, “While most companies resist break-ups, the corporate history is that most companies actually perform better after they’ve been split up.” These comments contrast Meta’s extensive efforts to keep its “family of apps” together under one proverbial roof. The FTC brought in other Zuckerberg emails as evidence, including a 2011 message that called Instagram a “large and viable competitor to us on mobile photos” and a 2012 message that critiqued the teams led by Facebook’s chief tech officer at the time, Mike Schroepfer. “Messenger isn’t beating WhatsApp, Instagram was growing so much faster than us that we had to buy them for $1 billion,” Zuckerberg said. “That’s not exactly killing it,” he added, per a CNN (WBD+0.75%) report. The following year, Facebook’s current chief operating officer, Javier Olivan, shared concerns with Zuckerberg about WhatsApp’s growth. Messages presented in court, according to The Hill, show that Olivan told Zuckerberg that he’d “been thinking hard about this for the past couple of sleepless nights since I am really worried … these guys are the real deal,” he said. Zuckerberg was reportedly worried at the time that WhatsApp could offer features similar to Facebook and “start winning in the U.S. and other markets.” Rebecca Allensworth, an antitrust law expert and Vanderbilt’s associate dean for research, told Quartz on Thursday: “So far, the government has done a good job using Zuckerberg’s own words against him, and he has done a good job deflecting them to the degree possible.” “But there is only so much Zuckerberg can do now to walk back on what he said then,” Allensworth added. “These are the worst facts of the case from Meta’s perspective, and the government laid some important blows.” Sheryl Sandberg, Meta’s former chief operating officer, also took the stand this week. There, the FTC confronted Sandberg about a message she sent in 2011, when Google debuted its now-defunct Facebook clone. Remarking on Google+, she reportedly told staffers that “the most important thing to acknowledge is that for the first time we have real competition and consumers have real choice.” About a year later, Sandberg said she “would block Google” from advertising its rival on Facebook, according to court evidence published by Bloomberg. Sandberg argued that these messages weren’t about putting its rivals at a disadvantage. “I said that to rally the troops,” she countered. Lots of interesting bits surfaced this week. In 2022, for example, Zuckerberg floated purging users’ friend lists as a “potentially crazy idea” to breathe some life into Facebook, according to evidence presented in the trial. Zuckerberg reasoned at the time that “wiping everyone’s graphs and having them start again” could reinvigorate engagement on the service, but it never came to pass. In a call to the FTC’s chair Andrew Ferguson, Zuckerberg tried to convince the agency to settle its antitrust case for $450 million — and later $1 billion, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. The FTC, meanwhile, was looking for a settlement worth 30 times as much, per the Journal. Going forward, “the big thing I’m looking for is some expert testimony on what is the right way to think about the market here and Meta’s alleged monopoly power,” Allensworth said. “So far, on that front, we only have testimony by executives at Meta and potential other competitor (like YouTube) about their perceptions of whether Meta faces meaningful competition from social media companies that are not ‘personal,’ like TikTok and YouTube.” Allensworth added, “Judges tend to put a lot of stock in expert opinion in antitrust cases, especially when it comes to market definition and monopoly power.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Stream ingest data from Kafka to Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases using custom connectors
URL: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/stream-ingest-data-from-kafka-to-amazon-bedrock-knowledge-bases-using-custom-connectors/

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances AI responses by combining the generative AI model’s capabilities with information from external data sources, rather than relying solely on the model’s built-in knowledge. In this post, we showcase the custom data connector capability in Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases that makes it straightforward to build RAG workflows with custom input data. Through this capability, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases supports the ingestion of streaming data, which means developers can add, update, or delete data in their knowledge base through direct API calls. Think of the examples of clickstream data, credit card swipes, Internet of Things (IoT) sensor data, log analysis and commodity prices—where both current data and historical trends are important to make a learned decision. Previously, to feed such critical data inputs, you had to first stage it in a supported data source and then either initiate or schedule a data sync job. Based on the quality and quantity of the data, the time to complete this process varied. With custom data connectors, you can quickly ingest specific documents from custom data sources without requiring a full sync and ingest streaming data without the need for intermediary storage. By avoiding time-consuming full syncs and storage steps, you gain faster access to data, reduced latency, and improved application performance. However, with streaming ingestion using custom connectors, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases processes such streaming data without using an intermediary data source, making it available almost immediately. This feature chunks and converts input data into embeddings using your chosen Amazon Bedrock model and stores everything in the backend vector database. This automation applies to both newly created and existing databases, streamlining your workflow so you can focus on building AI applications without worrying about orchestrating data chunking, embeddings generation, or vector store provisioning and indexing. Additionally, this feature provides the ability to ingest specific documents from custom data sources, all while reducing latency and alleviating operational costs for intermediary storage. Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies such as Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Stability AI, and Amazon through a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities you need to build generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI. Using Amazon Bedrock, you can experiment with and evaluate top FMs for your use case, privately customize them with your data using techniques such as fine-tuning and RAG, and build agents that execute tasks using your enterprise systems and data sources. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases allows organizations to build fully managed RAG pipelines by augmenting contextual information from private data sources to deliver more relevant, accurate, and customized responses. With Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, you can build applications that are enriched by the context that is received from querying a knowledge base. It enables a faster time to product release by abstracting from the heavy lifting of building pipelines and providing you an out-of-the-box RAG solution, thus reducing the build time for your application. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases supports custom connectors and the ingestion of streaming data, which means you can add, update, or delete data in your knowledge base through direct API calls. For this post, we implement a RAG architecture with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases using a custom connector and topics built with Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) for a user who may be interested to understand stock price trends. Amazon MSK is a streaming data service that manages Apache Kafka infrastructure and operations, making it straightforward to run Apache Kafka applications on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The solution enables real-time analysis of customer feedback through vector embeddings and large language models (LLMs). The following architecture diagram has two components: Preprocessing streaming data workflow noted in letters on the top of the diagram: Runtime execution during user queries noted in numerals at the bottom of the diagram: The implementation follows these high-level steps: To build a generative AI stock analysis tool with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases custom connector, use instructions in the following sections. To try this architecture, deploy the AWS CloudFormation template from this GitHub repository in your AWS account. This template deploys the following components: In the precreated MSK cluster, the required brokers are deployed ready for use. The next step is to use a SageMaker Studio terminal instance to connect to the MSK cluster and create the test stream topic. In this step, you follow the detailed instructions that are mentioned at Create a topic in the Amazon MSK cluster. The following are the general steps involved: To create a knowledge base in Amazon Bedrock, follow these steps: Now, using API calls, you configure the consumer Lambda function so it gets triggered as soon as the input Apache Kafka topic receives data. The Apache Kafka consumer Lambda function reads data from the Apache Kafka topic, decodes it, extracts stock price information, and ingests it into the Amazon Bedrock knowledge base using the custom connector. Now that the required setup is done, you trigger the workflow by ingesting test data into your Apache Kafka topic hosted with the MSK cluster. For best results, repeat this section by changing the .csv input file to show stock price increase or decrease. If the data ingestion and subsequent processing is successful, navigate to the Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases data source page to check the uploaded information. Within the Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases console, you have access to query the ingested data immediately, as shown in the following screenshot. To do that, select an Amazon Bedrock FM that you have access to. In my case, I chose Amazon Nova Lite 1.0, as shown in the following screenshot. When it’s completed, the question, “How is ZVZZT trending?”, yields the results based on the ingested data. Note how Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases shows how it derived the answer, even pointing to the granular data element from its source. To make sure you’re not paying for resources, delete and clean up the resources created. In this post, we showed you how Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases supports custom connectors and the ingestion of streaming data, through which developers can add, update, or delete data in their knowledge base through direct API calls. Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases offers fully managed, end-to-end RAG workflows to create highly accurate, low-latency, secure, and custom generative AI applications by incorporating contextual information from your company’s data sources. With this capability, you can quickly ingest specific documents from custom data sources without requiring a full sync, and ingest streaming data without the need for intermediary storage.

Title: Damn the tariffs! Full speed ahead on AI!

Time Published: 2025-04-18T14:58:35Z

UPDATED 10:58 EDT / APRIL 18 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof Seemingly oblivious to the faltering economy, new artificial intelligence models kept coming fast and furious this week, especially from OpenAI — and apparently they’re pretty popular. China’s DeepSeek? Not so much, at least with the U.S. government, as a House committee just labeled it a security threat. In perhaps a sign that its massive funding is burning a hole in its pocket, OpenAI is also looking at creating a social network. Perhaps Sam Altman sees an opening, given that TikTok still faces having to shut down in the U.S. and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg tried and failed to pay off the FTC to drop its antitrust lawsuit this week, which could force it to unwind its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. But honestly I don’t really get it any more than I get Elon Musk trying to goose Grok by connecting it to X. IPOs surprisingly aren’t quite dead yet, as Figma filed confidentially this week and Kodiak Robotics said it will go public via a SPAC. But with Trump kicking the economy into a ditch, it’s hard to see any kind of IPO revival. Meanwhile, the tariff gyrations caused tech stocks to plunge again Wednesday, and the overall market fell Thursday too. Nvidia is producing its latest-generation Blackwell AI chips in Arizona with TSMC, and it’s building AI supercomputers in Texas with Foxconn and Wistron — both no doubt in the works for years, even if Trump likely will try to take credit. But that won’t help prevent more troubles from tariffs and other trade limitations, as Nvidia faces a $5.5 billion sales hit from limits on shipping its H20 chip to China. AMD also estimates an $800 million charge from U.S. restrictions on China trade, and ASML missed order expectations amid tariff uncertainty. And surely there’s more trouble coming. No wonder Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang just hopped on a plane to China to smooth things over with officials and local customers. Private equity is staying busy as the stock market creates bargains and targets: Elliott Management has bought up $1.5 billion worth of HPE’s stock. Suffice to say, expect some changes ahead for HPE. Meantime, Intel sold 51% of Altera to Silverlake for $3.4 billion, at a valuation of $8.75 billion — a big haircut from its original acquisition price of $16.7 billion. Google lost another antitrust case, this one on its ad tech offering. But Google will appeal and ad tech is 17% of its business, so the previous case declaring Google Search a monopoly, which awaits a judge’s remedies, remains the bigger deal. If government agencies can still work together in this day and age, it’s not a stretch that a deal involving both cases could happen in place of years of further litigation. The critical CVE Program for tracking cybersecurity vulnerabilities got a last-minute funding reprieve, but it never should have come to this. It’s hard not to feel that we’re one more bad decision by the confederacy of clowns away from disaster. Infrastructure is still getting some big fundraises: Hammerspace raised a hefty $100 million for its Linux-powered data management platform. And Auradine nabbed $153 million to develop bitcoin mining and AI networking hardware. Tech earnings season gets underway in earnest next week with SAP, Tesla, IBM, ServiceNow, Check Point Software, Pegasystems, Intel and Alphabet. The results won’t be nearly as interesting as the outlooks, which surely won’t be robust.

Title: Freshman Rep. Suhas Subramanyam Blasts Data Centers While Cashing In on the Tech Companies That Own Them

Time Published: 2025-04-18T09:00:18Z
Full Content:
He's talking tough on big tech—but banking on their servers. Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, a freshman Democrat who represents Northern Virginia, is sounding the alarm about the large data centers that have cropped up in his district, blasting them as "invasive" pollutants that could attract cyberattacks. Those centers support more than 78,000 jobs in Northern Virginia. And while Subramanyam doesn't want them in his backyard, he owns hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of stock in the companies that own them, records show. Subramanyam is sitting on at least $630,000 worth of stock in companies like Amazon, Meta, and NVIDIA, with holdings potentially in excess of $1 million, according to congressional financial disclosures. The companies own or provide critical support to a lion's share of the Virginia data centers, which help power the internet by storing user data for some of America's largest companies. Subramanyam's district is home to more data centers than any other in the country—but during a recent committee hearing, he portrayed them as a creeping menace. "They seemed like a great idea at the time ... but our community is paying the price now, and we're a cautionary tale for the rest of the country," Subramanyam said, calling the centers "not great for the communities." "[In]the next five years alone, data centers can increase customers bills by up to $276 a year, and people's utility bills may double in the next 7 to 10 years just to power data centers," Subramanyam said. "And the environmental impact is real as well. These green spaces are disappearing. Pollution is rising and water supplies are being stretched thin. It's making reaching our clean energy goals in Virginia nearly impossible." "And it's also a security risk," the congressman continued, warning that Russia or other malign actors would be tempted to target the data center hub which had emerged in his district. "You just look at the Ukraine war. When Russia failed to hack Ukraine’s telecom networks, what did they target? They targeted the data centers." A combination of factors—including tax incentives, an abundance of skilled labor, good climate, and proximity to cable internet infrastructure—has made Northern Virginia an ideal spot for the tech sector's data centers. Should they move elsewhere, Subramanyam's stock portfolio would likely rebound—and the area he represents would lose some $31 billion in economic output, according to the Northern Virginia Technology Council. Subramanyam specifically holds at least $500,000 in NVIDIA and at least $130,000 more in Amazon and Meta, according to his most recent personal financial disclosures. Amazon alone maintains at least 93 data centers in Northern Virginia, according to DataCenters.com, a third-party monitoring website. Meta's data center in Sandston, Va., occupies 450,000 square feet and cost $1 billion, according to the Virginia Economic Development Partnership. And while NVIDIA does not own centers outright, they play an integral role in the data center ecosystem. The company's NVIDIA DGX-Ready Data Center program partners with centers by providing coveted certifications guaranteeing they are optimized to handle the various demands and requirements of their parent companies. Rep. Nick Langworthy (R., N.Y.) sent a message to the companies operating data centers in Subramanyam's district. "We need to focus on keeping America competitive and powering our future," he told the Washington Free Beacon. "If Rep. Subramanyam is too foolish to want these great jobs in his district, bring them to mine!" Subramanyam did not respond to a request for comment.

Title: Netflix Earnings: What To Know About Lofty Expectations Behind Today’s Q1 Report

Netflix had its best quarter ever, according to earnings results announced Thursday afternoon, setting the stakes for Netflix stock moving forward after it emerged as a perhaps surprising stock market safe haven during the recent slump. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos attends a Netflix premiere in February. In its Q1 report released shortly after 4 p.m. EDT market close, Netflix reported its best-ever quarterly earnings per share and revenue numbers. Netflix scored $6.61 EPS ($2.9 billion net income) and $10.54 billion last quarter, besting consensus analyst estimates calling for the entertainment titan to report $5.67 adjusted EPS ($2.5 billion net income) and $10.5 billion in sales, according to FactSet data. The company said it expects $11 billion in sales and $7.03 EPS during the second quarter, topping top and bottom line forecasts of $10.9 billion and $6.25, respectively. Shares of Netflix rose 1.2% to $973 on Thursday, surging another 3% in after-hours trading to nearly $1,000 per share. Netflix has emerged from the 2025 stock losses stronger, gaining 4% since April 2 and 9% year-to-date. That came as the S&P 500 (down 6% since April 2, 10% year-to-date excluding dividends) and the Nasdaq (-7%, -15%) both pulled back as President Donald Trump’s trade war heightened recession concerns. Many analysts herald Netflix stock as a safe parking spot as economic slowdown fears swirl. “If a recession hits, we would expect Netflix subscribers to be sticky as Netflix is a stay-at-home cheap diversion, of the type that has held up well in past recessions,” Rosenblatt analyst Barton Crockett wrote in a Monday note to clients. “Amid recent market volatility, Netflix's strong subscription model with critical entertainment (which historically has performed well in a recession) has made the stock a defensive choice for investors,” Bank of America analysts led by Jessica Reif Ehrlich concurred in a Tuesday note. Netflix has far outperformed other members of the “FAANG” group, smashing returns this year from the other high-growth technology names: Facebook parent Meta (down 14% year-to-date excluding dividends), Amazon (-21%), Apple (-21%) and Google parent Alphabet (-19%). Netflix has also outperformed Disney (-23% year-to-date) and Max parent Warner Bros. Discovery (-23%), though audio streamer Spotify’s 29% gain this year tops Netflix’s. Fellow FAANG constituents Alphabet and Amazon will join Netflix in reporting Q1 earnings next week. Both West Coast titans will deliver results next Thursday. One Community. Many Voices.

Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce.

The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures.

Title: You Know Who Else Really Hates Trump’s Tariffs? Hollywood

Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter The pandemic and strikes were bad enough. But, with entertainment companies struggling to stay in the black amidst Trumpian chaos, a recession could be an extinction-level event. By Alex Weprin Media & Business Writer In March 2009, just a few months after the 2008 stock market crash, Disney CEO Bob Iger gathered company shareholders inside Oakland’s Paramount Theatre, a short drive from Pixar’s headquarters in Emeryville. “We are meeting during perhaps the most difficult economic times of our lifetime. And these are conditions that even the strongest companies can’t fully escape,” Iger told the crowd. “I’m confident, though, that our brands, our products and our people can overcome the challenges ahead.” Eventually, the economy recovered, and so did Disney. But that didn’t diminish the short-term discomfort. As damaging as that crash was, however, the media business had a strong foundation to fall back on; 2008, in fact, represented the peak of pay TV, per Leichtman Research Group, with 87 percent of households, more than 100 million strong, paying their cable or satellite bills every month as entertainment giants reaped their share amid the pain. Related Stories Business Streaming Profit Report: Netflix Leads, Disney Rises, Warner Grows. Is Consolidation Next? Business The Incredible Shrinking Studio Chief Now the economy feels as if it is again on a precipice, with a tariffs-induced shock stinging global markets. But this time, TV’s financial system is radically different. Disney is in many ways a textbook example. Yes, its advertising took a hit in 2008, as did its theme parks business, the result of consumers reexamining vacation plans. But ESPN saw growth, thanks to contractual rate increases and pay TV’s ubiquity. Pay TV was a utility, something every household needed to have, like electricity and water. Now, it is a shell of its former self, with fewer than 70 million households and falling rapidly. Consumers get their entertainment, news and sports through a hodgepodge of streaming services, with some seen as necessities (maybe YouTube and Netflix) and others seen as expendable. And unlike cable TV, unsubscribing is as easy as clicking a button. And while the 2020 pandemic shock worked to the benefit of legacy media entering the streaming fray (bolstered by consumers largely staying home), 2025 is a different beast, with inflationary concerns top of mind and no shortage of other entertainment options available. In an April 10 report titled “never-ending tumult,” Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich noted that “traditionally, cable companies have tended to be viewed as defensive in recessions. This view has been driven by the utility and subscription-based nature of their offerings as well as limited competition against those offerings. However, Cable operators now face increased broadband/video competition vs. prior recessions. This backdrop challenges the traditional perception of Cable companies as safe havens during an economic downturn.” Most know that advertising is always impacted in recessions, but there’s reason to believe that a recession this time could be worse than in downturns past. In 2008, TV was the king of advertising, accounting for the lion’s share of ad spend, according to Magna. Today’s advertising environment is vastly different, with tech giants Google, Meta and Amazon dominating the space with performance-driven ads as TV’s piece of the pie shrinks (though streaming and connected TV ads are growing, albeit not enough to offset linear’s losses). A recession now could be the thing that pushes linear TV off the edge. “Given the ongoing secular headwinds facing the linear TV ecosystem, we worry that television could mirror the fate of radio and newspapers during past recessions,” MoffettNathanson’s Michael Nathanson wrote in an April 9 report, adding that $45 billion in ad revenue could be lost in a recessionary situation. “Should budgets shift away from linear TV at an accelerated pace, we see risk of a more permanent reallocation toward connected TV and broader digital channels.” “We continue to believe that Online advertising will hold up better than traditional TV and other legacy channels,” he continued. “In a more cautious environment, marketers will prioritize performance-driven advertising over broad brand campaigns — a dynamic that favors digital and measurable media.” Media analyst Brad Adgate was an executive at Horizon Media in 2008. He recalls the mass layoffs that the advertising and media businesses went through amid the tumult. “That’s what I remember most vividly,” he says, adding that he sees TV as particularly at risk in this moment. “There’s concern that if the budgets are going to remain flat or even drop, it’s going to be much more pressure on video and television to compete with all the choices marketers have.” But even tech giants are exposed. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy was asked April 10 on CNBC if his company is feeling a pinch in its advertising business. “When you have things like tariffs, it’ll create macro issues where it depresses demand or drives inflation,” he noted. At Warner Bros. Discovery, CEO David Zaslav sent a note to staffers telling them to batten down the hatches and reduce discretionary spending because of “market volatility and reduced consumer confidence.” That said, TV still has an ace up its sleeve in the form of live sports — the NFL in particular. Its scale is unmatched, and advertisers are unlikely to meaningfully scale back their sports investments. Or as Reif-Ehrlich writes: Sports “remain resilient in tepid advertising markets.” But even there, any benefit is splintered and offset. Disney benefits from sports thanks to ESPN, but its theme parks are extraordinarily exposed in a downturn. While Disney and NBCUniversal’s experiences business are brand-defining in most economies, in a recession, their high fixed costs become a burden, as consumers pare spending. Disney and NBCU also have historically benefitted from such consumer products as toys and clothing, where licensing deals mean fat margins for the IP owners. But given the steep tariffs on China and Vietnam, those margins are bring pressured. That said, Reif-Ehrlich notes the opening of Epic Universe could help NBCU manage some of those issues, given likely demand for the entirely new Orlando theme park. Despite all the doom and gloom and the difficult comparison to past recessions, some analysts still see green shoots. The music business is vastly healthier than it was in 2008, when Spotify was still an experiment in Sweden, the record labels were reeling and Apple’s iTunes carried the day. Multiple analysts are framing Spotify and music industry stocks as a safe haven. “We very much doubt that a recession would drive a meaningful increase in churn at what are reasonably priced music subscription services,” TD Cowen’s Doug Creutz wrote April 9. Similarly, Netflix is seen as “more resilient” than other entertainment companies, says Nathanson, given its dominance in subscription streaming and the fact that advertising is not yet a meaningful driver of its business, allowing it breathing room that more established media companies don’t have. Even there, of course, pressure remains. “Tougher macro/recession could delay [Netflix] price increases in certain markets,” JPMorgan’s Doug Anmuth noted on April 8. And yet anxiety remains high, with tariffs and a recession not the only tail risks facing the industry. One media veteran says that entertainment executives they have spoken to are already gaming out scenarios where interest in American popular culture sours and the globalization of entertainment that has spread U.S. franchises and brands around the world begins to reverse in favor of more localized fare. That is a world where some of Hollywood’s greatest strengths — its decades of beloved IP — could work against it, and the ramifications of that new world order, should it come to pass, would be sweeping.

Markets sank sharply on Wednesday after back-to-back tariff-related headlines from Nvidia and the Federal Reserve rattled investor confidence. The sell-off started after a disclosure on Tuesday evening after markets closed from Nvidia, which warned of a $5.5 billion hit due to export rules on H20 AI chips developed for the Chinese market. Nvidia appears to be caught in the increasing tension over tariffs between the US and China. Stock losses deepened after Federal Reserve President Jerome Powell cautioned that renewed tariffs under the Trump administration could create a "challenging scenario" for the economy. He warned that the Fed's dual mandate — low unemployment and price stability— could be tested if tariffs drive up consumer prices while slowing growth. Here is how much each of the Magnificent 7 lost on Wednesday — and since Trump's inauguration — at market closing at 4 p.m. ET, according to Yahoo Finance. Loss in stock value since January 21: 20.51% Loss in stock value on April 16: 2% Alphabet, Google's parent company, took a comparatively smaller loss on Wednesday but still saw about one-fifth of its stock value wiped out since Trump became president. In February, Nvidia replaced Alphabet as Wall Street's third most valuable company. Alphabet donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration. Loss in stock value since January 21: 22.16% Loss in stock value on April 16: 2.93% Amazon, the global e-commerce giant, has lost about one-fifth of its share value since Trump's inauguration and could be hit further by tariffs, especially the up to 245% in duties imposed on China. Amazon donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund, and founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos attended. Small businesses selling on Amazon told Business Insider they are struggling to keep their doors open as their already razor-thin margins shrink further under tariffs. Loss in stock value since January 21: 9.21% Loss in stock value on April 16: 3.89% Apple shares briefly rallied on Monday on a surprise tariff exemption on key tech products, but the reprieve was short-lived. The tech giant is also planning to spend and invest more than $500 billion in the US over the next four years. Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, personally donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee and attended the ceremony. Loss in stock value since January 21: 15.40% Loss in stock value on April 16: 3.68% Meta, parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is currently facing a blockbuster antitrust trial with the Federal Trade Commission that opened on Monday and is expected to run up to eight weeks. The tech giant had donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg attended the ceremony. Loss in stock value since January 21: 9.98% Loss in stock value on April 16: 3.66% Microsoft has been rethinking its performance reviews and is mulling another round of job cuts that could come as soon as May, after already having fired "low-performers" in January. Loss in stock value since January 21: 20.33% Loss in stock value on April 16: 6.87% A main character of Wednesday's stock market woes, Nvidia, the chipmaking giant, took a heavy loss in shares and at one point neared a 10% loss before bouncing back toward market close. The semiconductor maker developed H20 AI chips for China but disclosed Tuesday that new US export restrictions have effectively blocked Nvidia from selling the inventory, which weighed down share values of the broader tech sector. Loss in stock value since January 21: 40.08% Loss in stock value on April 16: 4.94% Tesla, the EV giant, had an especially difficult year in terms of sales and share value for reasons that go beyond tariffs or generally low consumer sentiments. Public backlash over Musk's political involvement and ties to the White House's DOGE office resulted in mass protests and boycotts of Tesla vehicles, and his focus on DOGE made investors question his commitment to the company. Elon Musk has donated over $260 million to support Trump's return to the White House, along with $12 million toward a failed conservative bid in Wisconsin's Supreme Court race. Jump to

The GeForce RTX 4060 Ti was arguably Nvidia's least-appealing last-generation graphics card. It shipped for $399 with just 8GB of GDDR6 memory and a crippling 128-bit memory interface, which combined to make it a deeply unappealing option compared with the standard RTX 4060, the RTX 4070, or AMD’s Radeon RX 7700 XT. (Nvidia also released a 16GB version for $499, an even tougher sell.) Today's release of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, available with either 8GB ($379) or 16GB ($429) of GDDR7 video memory, is poised to right some of these wrongs. We've put PNY’s $429 GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB Overclocked Dual Fan model through our rigorous tests to see how it fares. While Nvidia, bafflingly, retained its narrow 128-bit memory interface, the RTX 5060 Ti is far more appealing than the RTX 4060 Ti ever was, with GDDR7 offsetting this shortcoming quite well. This point is particularly true when considering the RTX 4060 Ti 16GB launched at $499, with the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB costing a surprising $70 less. The RTX 5060 Ti is ideal for gamers who want to play at 1440p or 1600p, where it can run current games with near-maximum settings while maintaining a smooth refresh rate. That earns it our Editors’ Choice award for mainstream 1440p play. (Gamers looking to run games at 1080p with a high refresh rate would also get a lot of joy from the RTX 5060 Ti, but it's edging on overkill for that resolution.) All this is contingent, of course, on the supply of the GPUs and how the ultimate pricing shakes out for US shoppers, with tariffs and possible shortages looming. The GeForce RTX 5060 Ti houses a GB206 graphics processor based on Nvidia’s "Blackwell" graphics architecture. This is the first desktop graphics card we’ve seen to use this graphics chip, which is similar to the AD106 chip inside the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti but with some enhancements. In addition to the performance boost the Blackwell architecture provides, the RTX 5060 Ti also has a higher core count than the RTX 4060 Ti. It has 36 streaming multiprocessors (SMs) compared with the RTX 4060 Ti’s total of 34. Most of the hardware resources of an Nvidia graphics chip sit inside these SMs, and so this increase brings with it a higher number of CUDA cores, texture mapping units (TMUs), tensor cores, and ray-tracing cores, all of which you can see in the spec chart. Nvidia’s reference design for the RTX 5060 Ti calls for it to be clocked slightly higher than the RTX 4060 Ti. (Note: There is no Founders Edition version of this card.) This increase in clock speed, combined with the bump up in hardware resources, should provide around a 10% increase in performance, in addition to any gains derived from the improved Blackwell architecture. Unfortunately, the RTX 4060 Ti's least appealing feature, its narrow 128-bit memory interface, lives on in the RTX 5060 Ti. Memory bandwidth is essential for driving fast graphics performance, and this design choice hampered the RTX 4060 Ti's performance, particularly at higher resolutions. This 128-bit-wide memory interface is one of the key reasons the RTX 4060 Ti was a bummer of a card. This interface remains a limiting factor on the new Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, but it is far less significant than it was on the 4060 Ti. Nvidia equipped the RTX 5060 Ti with 28Gbps GDDR7 memory, which is far faster than the 18Gbps GDDR6 memory that the 4060 Ti shipped with. This resulted in a greater than 50% increase in overall memory bandwidth (to 448GBps, from 288GBps). Assuming you can find a card at the actual MSRP, you'll also find improvement in this generation in terms of pricing, particularly on the 16GB models. The RTX 4060 Ti launched at $399 for the 8GB model and a prohibitively high price of $499 for the 16GB model, which I genuinely hope no one paid full price for. The 8GB RTX 5060 Ti is a little more affordable than its predecessor at $379, and the 16GB model is much more enticing at $429. I would have considered this a bit high for the RTX 4060 Ti in retrospect due to its memory issues, but as you are about to see, GDDR7 goes a long way to address those limitations. The memory interface on a component like the graphics card essentially works like pipes; think of data as the water. The wider the interface, the more pipes you have, and the more data can travel to or from the graphics chip at any given time. Naturally, if we increase the number of pipes by widening the interface from, say, 128 bits wide (like on the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti) to 192 bits wide (like on the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070), we enable more data to be in motion between the graphics chip and the VRAM at any given time. We typically measure the bandwidth of how much data can pass through this connection in terms of gigabytes per second, or GBps for short. Widening the memory interface is an effective way to increase the amount of bandwidth a graphics card has. But it comes at a cost: You will need more memory chips, a more complicated PCB, and additional circuitry on the graphics chip itself to support this. All of that naturally will impact the price, but there's an easier way to increase bandwidth: by simply opting for VRAM that runs at a higher speed. Going back to our pipes analogy, this effectively works like increasing the water pressure, forcing more through each second. This is why the adoption of GDDR7 memory for the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti is so impactful. This GDDR7 is rated to push 28Gbps (gigabits per second) as opposed to the 18Gbps of the GDDR6 used on the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti. The math for calculating bandwidth works like this: Memory interface width in bits x RAM speed = Bandwidth in Gbps From here, all we have to do in order to get the bandwidth in GBps is to divide by eight. Plugging in those numbers for the RTX 4060 Ti, we get this this: 128 x 18 = 2,304Gbps Dividing that by eight gives us a final bandwidth for the RTX 4060 Ti of 288GBps. If we do the same for the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, we have the following equation... 128 x 28 = 3,584Gbps ...which then gives us a total bandwidth of 448GBps after dividing by eight. Effectively, this means that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti has roughly 56% more bandwidth than the RTX 4060 Ti while maintaining the same 128-bit interface. This goes a long way to reducing the negative impacts of having a 128-bit bus. Before delving into the benchmark tests, let’s look at the specific RTX 5060 Ti model we received for review. PNY’s GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB Overclocked Dual Fan graphics card is a relatively plain model in the series. It lacks RGB lighting and uses a simple dual-fan thermal solution. It also has a metal backplate and occupies only two open expansion slots. This card's rear I/O bracket features three DisplayPort connections and a single HDMI port. For power delivery, this particular PNY card requires just a single 8-pin power connection, which is a refreshing change from the banks of multiple 6-pin or 8-pin connectors or the polarizing, Nvidia-specific 12VHPWR connector that has dominated the higher-end RTX 50-series cards we have tested. PNY suggests a minimum 600-watt PSU for use with this card. We tested the PNY GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB Overclocked Dual Fan graphics card on our recently rebuilt graphics card testbed, which features an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X CPU. This CPU is installed on a Gigabyte X870E Aorus Master motherboard with two 16GB sticks of DDR5 RAM in a dual-channel configuration, using an AMD EXPO memory profile to set the RAM to 6,000MHz. The CPU is also cooled by a 360mm Cooler Master liquid cooler. This system is configured with two 2TB Crucial PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSDs, one dedicated to holding games and the other to holding Windows 11 and everything else. It is powered by a 1,500-watt Corsair power supply. As the name indicates, our PNY card has a slight overclock over stock speeds, as indicated by the base/boost clocks in the chart above. Upon launch, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti meets an open playing field in its price range. The AMD Radeon RX 9070 and the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 are both $549 MSRP, creating substantial space between them in terms of cost and direct competition. This gap leaves only last-generation graphics cards, like the AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT and Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti, to compete with the RTX 5060 Ti near its price point. These older cards can still put up a fight, but as they use older technology, the RTX 5060 Ti has the advantage. The synthetic test results suggest a substantial performance gain when moving from the RTX 4060 Ti to the RTX 5060 Ti across the board. Results against AMD’s Radeon RX 7800 XT were more mixed, but the RX 7800 XT came out ahead more often than not. These test results also clearly show that the RTX 5070 and AMD’s Radeon RX 9070 are far ahead of the RTX 5060 Ti, which is reflected in their shared starting price. UL’s Procyon AI text generation is one of the first reliable tests we have to gauge AI performance. (Testing AI performance in any holistic sense is difficult, particularly as on-card AI muscle addresses a wide range of tasks—training versus inferencing, for one thing. It is impossible with current tools to test a very broad set of AI local-processing scenarios in an all-encompassing way.) This test presses the GPU on a series of text-creation inferencing tasks via four popular AI large language models (LLMs) run locally, and produces an overall score in each case. (Here, Procyon uses versions of Mistral, Microsoft's PHI, and two flavors of Meta AI's Llama.) It also reports how many tokens (or discrete units of text, in the context of text generation) the hardware can produce per second with each model. It also measures the time it takes to produce the first token. Regarding AI performance, the RTX 5060 Ti was once again a notable step ahead of the RTX 4060 Ti. (Note that our RTX 4060 Ti test sample was an 8GB card.) It was substantially faster in all of the tests, and the RTX 5060 Ti ran the Llama 2 tests without issue, whereas the RTX 4060 Ti failed to run those benchmarks. AMD didn't stand much chance here, with the RTX 5060 Ti beating even the Radeon RX 9070 XT in this area in all but three tests. That’s a big deal if you care about AI performance and plan to heavily use local-processed AI in your work or leisure time, but for most people, this likely isn’t important right now. And AI pros aren't buying mainstream consumer cards like these. Using graphics cards for GPU-accelerated content creation tasks is common today, and here, Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 5060 Ti scored a more substantial win over AMD's cards. The RTX 5060 Ti effectively tied with the Radeon RX 9070 XT in Adobe Premiere, and it was far faster than the Radeon RX 7900 GRE in Blender. The RX 9070 XT failed to run the Blender benchmark, but unless it would have nearly doubled the performance of the RX 7900 GRE, it will be slower than the RTX 5060 Ti in this area, too. The RTX 5060 Ti also significantly outpaced the RTX 4060 Ti here. However, I wouldn’t recommend anyone upgrade from the RTX 4060 Ti to the RTX 5060 Ti, as I don’t consider these gains enough to justify the cost of replacing such a recent card. Regardless, you would see a noticeable uplift in many content creation tasks. AMD’s FSR, Intel’s XeSS, and Nvidia’s DLSS technologies work in two ways to algorithmically enhance performance. First, they use algorithms crunched on GPU silicon to upscale images rendered at lower resolutions into sharper images. Second, they similarly use algorithms to generate and insert additional frames between originally rendered frames to boost frame rates. DLSS is the most advanced in this second technique, generating up to three additional frames per raw frame render via what Nvidia calls Multi-Frame Generation in its 50-series cards. Regardless of version, each of these techniques works differently from each other to achieve similar goals, so you should be careful when considering results using these technologies against each other. However, due to the popularity of these techniques, it’s helpful to know how they compare in terms of performance. In these tests, the RTX 5060 Ti outpaced the RTX 4060 Ti again. The RTX 5060 Ti wasn’t a match for the RTX 5070 or the AMD Radeon RX 9070, but it performed similarly to the Radeon RX 7800 XT. With frame generation off, the RX 7800 XT lagged behind the RTX 5060 Ti, but it pulled ahead when this feature was enabled. I do not doubt that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti's GDDR7 memory helps it overcome the limitations of its narrow 128-bit memory interface. Still, as I said earlier, it doesn’t entirely fix the issue. In-game benchmarks give us the best idea of how much of a problem the 128-bit memory interface is, and they clearly show that the issue was much improved. A technical glitch prevented us from testing the RTX 5060 Ti at 1080p in Cyberpunk 2077, but with the resolution set to 1440p and 4K, the RTX 5060 Ti outpaced the RX 7900 GRE and the RX 7800 XT, both of which have wider 256-bit memory interfaces and more memory bandwidth. The RTX 5060 Ti’s improved graphics cores and faster GDDR7 memory speeds enabled it to pull ahead despite this disadvantage in Cyberpunk 2077. It also trounced the RTX 4060 Ti. At 1080p in F1 2024, the RTX 5060 Ti was slightly ahead of AMD’s Radeon RX 7900 GRE before it effectively tied at 1440p and 4K. The RTX 5060 Ti still holds the overall advantage, but it notably dropped further than the RX 7900 GRE when transitioning from 1080p to 1440p. This is likely due to the RTX 5060 Ti having less bandwidth than the RX 7900 GRE. The impact here is slight, but the issues that the narrow 128-bit interface can cause are more evident in Far Cry 6. Typically, if memory bandwidth isn’t a problem, performance tends to scale linearly with resolution. This means most graphics cards tend to have their frame rates drop a similar proportional amount when moving from, say, 1080p to 1440p. When we see one card dropping faster than the others, it's typically a sign of a bottleneck somewhere, and for the RTX 5060 Ti, that’s almost certainly its narrow memory interface. In F1 2024, the impact of this was negligible. The RTX 5060 Ti lost 36% of its frame rate when transitioning from 1080p to 1440p, whereas the RX 7900 GRE dropped by 33%. This is enough difference to close the performance gap between the two, but not much else. This is far more noticeable in Far Cry 6, where the RTX 5060 Ti went from having a significant lead over the Radeon RX 7900 GRE and the Radeon RX 7800 XT at 1080p to being slower than both at 1440p and 4K. From 1080p to 1440p, the RTX 5060 Ti dropped 22% of its performance while the RX 7900 GRE only lost 8%. Both dropped a fair bit when cranking the resolution up to 4K, but the RTX 5060 Ti remained behind. A similar situation is observable in Returnal, where the RX 7900 GRE tied with the RTX 5060 Ti at 1080p, but the RX 7900 GRE came out on top at 1440p and 4K. This is again likely due to the RTX 5060 Ti's memory-bandwidth limitations brought about by the card's narrow 128-bit interface. The RTX 5060 Ti was behind the RX 7900 GRE at all resolutions in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, and this likely wasn't a result of the limited memory bandwidth. The bandwidth constraints of the RTX 5060 Ti aren't likely to impede 1080p resolutions, which the performance in the other games we tested supports—the RTX 5060 Ti is generally faster at 1080p. Instead, AMD's win here is likely due to better optimization for AMD hardware in these two games. In games that don’t support ray tracing, like Total War: Three Kingdoms and Shadow of the Tomb Raider, AMD’s previous-generation Radeon RX 7900 GRE and Radeon RX 7800 XT held a sizable lead over the RTX 5060 Ti. Those cards struggled to compete with the RTX 5060 Ti in games with ray-tracing support as their ray-tracing hardware is less robust, but if ray tracing is out of the equation, they can handily beat the RTX 5060 Ti. The Radeon RX 7900 GRE's and RX 7800 XT’s performance triumph in Shadow of the Tomb Raider, in particular, was helped by the RTX 5060 Ti’s narrow memory interface, which again held it back at 1440p and 4K. We use a Kill-A-Watt wall meter to measure the power consumption of our graphics card testbed as a whole during select tests to gauge the power draw of each tested graphics card. Power consumption in gaming increased a fair bit from the RTX 4060 Ti to the RTX 5060 Ti. The performance increase outweighs this increase in power draw, but drawing more power is never ideal. However, the RTX 5060 Ti’s power consumption was considerably lower than that of the AMD competition, except for the faster Radeon RX 9070, which is more efficient overall. The gaming thermals we recorded from the PNY GeForce RTX 5060 Ti weren’t terrible, but they certainly could have been better. Most of the other graphics cards in the chart stayed cooler during the testing process. Different models of the RTX 5060 Ti with more robust thermal solutions could perform better here. However, it isn’t strictly necessary, as 70 degrees C is within the safe operating range for a modern graphics card.

Plugging in those numbers for the RTX 4060 Ti, we get this this: 128 x 18 = 2,304Gbps Dividing that by eight gives us a final bandwidth for the RTX 4060 Ti of 288GBps. If we do the same for the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, we have the following equation... 128 x 28 = 3,584Gbps ...which then gives us a total bandwidth of 448GBps after dividing by eight. Effectively, this means that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti has roughly 56% more bandwidth than the RTX 4060 Ti while maintaining the same 128-bit interface. This goes a long way to reducing the negative impacts of having a 128-bit bus. Before delving into the benchmark tests, let’s look at the specific RTX 5060 Ti model we received for review. PNY’s GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB Overclocked Dual Fan graphics card is a relatively plain model in the series. It lacks RGB lighting and uses a simple dual-fan thermal solution. It also has a metal backplate and occupies only two open expansion slots. This card's rear I/O bracket features three DisplayPort connections and a single HDMI port. For power delivery, this particular PNY card requires just a single 8-pin power connection, which is a refreshing change from the banks of multiple 6-pin or 8-pin connectors or the polarizing, Nvidia-specific 12VHPWR connector that has dominated the higher-end RTX 50-series cards we have tested. PNY suggests a minimum 600-watt PSU for use with this card. We tested the PNY GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB Overclocked Dual Fan graphics card on our recently rebuilt graphics card testbed, which features an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X CPU. This CPU is installed on a Gigabyte X870E Aorus Master motherboard with two 16GB sticks of DDR5 RAM in a dual-channel configuration, using an AMD EXPO memory profile to set the RAM to 6,000MHz. The CPU is also cooled by a 360mm Cooler Master liquid cooler. This system is configured with two 2TB Crucial PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSDs, one dedicated to holding games and the other to holding Windows 11 and everything else. It is powered by a 1,500-watt Corsair power supply. As the name indicates, our PNY card has a slight overclock over stock speeds, as indicated by the base/boost clocks in the chart above. Upon launch, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti meets an open playing field in its price range. The AMD Radeon RX 9070 and the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 are both $549 MSRP, creating substantial space between them in terms of cost and direct competition. This gap leaves only last-generation graphics cards, like the AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT and Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti, to compete with the RTX 5060 Ti near its price point. These older cards can still put up a fight, but as they use older technology, the RTX 5060 Ti has the advantage. The synthetic test results suggest a substantial performance gain when moving from the RTX 4060 Ti to the RTX 5060 Ti across the board. Results against AMD’s Radeon RX 7800 XT were more mixed, but the RX 7800 XT came out ahead more often than not. These test results also clearly show that the RTX 5070 and AMD’s Radeon RX 9070 are far ahead of the RTX 5060 Ti, which is reflected in their shared starting price. UL’s Procyon AI text generation is one of the first reliable tests we have to gauge AI performance. (Testing AI performance in any holistic sense is difficult, particularly as on-card AI muscle addresses a wide range of tasks—training versus inferencing, for one thing. It is impossible with current tools to test a very broad set of AI local-processing scenarios in an all-encompassing way.) This test presses the GPU on a series of text-creation inferencing tasks via four popular AI large language models (LLMs) run locally, and produces an overall score in each case. (Here, Procyon uses versions of Mistral, Microsoft's PHI, and two flavors of Meta AI's Llama.) It also reports how many tokens (or discrete units of text, in the context of text generation) the hardware can produce per second with each model. It also measures the time it takes to produce the first token. Regarding AI performance, the RTX 5060 Ti was once again a notable step ahead of the RTX 4060 Ti. (Note that our RTX 4060 Ti test sample was an 8GB card.) It was substantially faster in all of the tests, and the RTX 5060 Ti ran the Llama 2 tests without issue, whereas the RTX 4060 Ti failed to run those benchmarks. AMD didn't stand much chance here, with the RTX 5060 Ti beating even the Radeon RX 9070 XT in this area in all but three tests. That’s a big deal if you care about AI performance and plan to heavily use local-processed AI in your work or leisure time, but for most people, this likely isn’t important right now. And AI pros aren't buying mainstream consumer cards like these. Using graphics cards for GPU-accelerated content creation tasks is common today, and here, Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 5060 Ti scored a more substantial win over AMD's cards. The RTX 5060 Ti effectively tied with the Radeon RX 9070 XT in Adobe Premiere, and it was far faster than the Radeon RX 7900 GRE in Blender. The RX 9070 XT failed to run the Blender benchmark, but unless it would have nearly doubled the performance of the RX 7900 GRE, it will be slower than the RTX 5060 Ti in this area, too. The RTX 5060 Ti also significantly outpaced the RTX 4060 Ti here. However, I wouldn’t recommend anyone upgrade from the RTX 4060 Ti to the RTX 5060 Ti, as I don’t consider these gains enough to justify the cost of replacing such a recent card. Regardless, you would see a noticeable uplift in many content creation tasks. AMD’s FSR, Intel’s XeSS, and Nvidia’s DLSS technologies work in two ways to algorithmically enhance performance. First, they use algorithms crunched on GPU silicon to upscale images rendered at lower resolutions into sharper images. Second, they similarly use algorithms to generate and insert additional frames between originally rendered frames to boost frame rates. DLSS is the most advanced in this second technique, generating up to three additional frames per raw frame render via what Nvidia calls Multi-Frame Generation in its 50-series cards. Regardless of version, each of these techniques works differently from each other to achieve similar goals, so you should be careful when considering results using these technologies against each other. However, due to the popularity of these techniques, it’s helpful to know how they compare in terms of performance. In these tests, the RTX 5060 Ti outpaced the RTX 4060 Ti again. The RTX 5060 Ti wasn’t a match for the RTX 5070 or the AMD Radeon RX 9070, but it performed similarly to the Radeon RX 7800 XT. With frame generation off, the RX 7800 XT lagged behind the RTX 5060 Ti, but it pulled ahead when this feature was enabled. I do not doubt that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti's GDDR7 memory helps it overcome the limitations of its narrow 128-bit memory interface. Still, as I said earlier, it doesn’t entirely fix the issue. In-game benchmarks give us the best idea of how much of a problem the 128-bit memory interface is, and they clearly show that the issue was much improved. A technical glitch prevented us from testing the RTX 5060 Ti at 1080p in Cyberpunk 2077, but with the resolution set to 1440p and 4K, the RTX 5060 Ti outpaced the RX 7900 GRE and the RX 7800 XT, both of which have wider 256-bit memory interfaces and more memory bandwidth. The RTX 5060 Ti’s improved graphics cores and faster GDDR7 memory speeds enabled it to pull ahead despite this disadvantage in Cyberpunk 2077. It also trounced the RTX 4060 Ti. At 1080p in F1 2024, the RTX 5060 Ti was slightly ahead of AMD’s Radeon RX 7900 GRE before it effectively tied at 1440p and 4K. The RTX 5060 Ti still holds the overall advantage, but it notably dropped further than the RX 7900 GRE when transitioning from 1080p to 1440p. This is likely due to the RTX 5060 Ti having less bandwidth than the RX 7900 GRE. The impact here is slight, but the issues that the narrow 128-bit interface can cause are more evident in Far Cry 6. Typically, if memory bandwidth isn’t a problem, performance tends to scale linearly with resolution. This means most graphics cards tend to have their frame rates drop a similar proportional amount when moving from, say, 1080p to 1440p. When we see one card dropping faster than the others, it's typically a sign of a bottleneck somewhere, and for the RTX 5060 Ti, that’s almost certainly its narrow memory interface. In F1 2024, the impact of this was negligible. The RTX 5060 Ti lost 36% of its frame rate when transitioning from 1080p to 1440p, whereas the RX 7900 GRE dropped by 33%. This is enough difference to close the performance gap between the two, but not much else. This is far more noticeable in Far Cry 6, where the RTX 5060 Ti went from having a significant lead over the Radeon RX 7900 GRE and the Radeon RX 7800 XT at 1080p to being slower than both at 1440p and 4K. From 1080p to 1440p, the RTX 5060 Ti dropped 22% of its performance while the RX 7900 GRE only lost 8%. Both dropped a fair bit when cranking the resolution up to 4K, but the RTX 5060 Ti remained behind. A similar situation is observable in Returnal, where the RX 7900 GRE tied with the RTX 5060 Ti at 1080p, but the RX 7900 GRE came out on top at 1440p and 4K. This is again likely due to the RTX 5060 Ti's memory-bandwidth limitations brought about by the card's narrow 128-bit interface. The RTX 5060 Ti was behind the RX 7900 GRE at all resolutions in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, and this likely wasn't a result of the limited memory bandwidth. The bandwidth constraints of the RTX 5060 Ti aren't likely to impede 1080p resolutions, which the performance in the other games we tested supports—the RTX 5060 Ti is generally faster at 1080p. Instead, AMD's win here is likely due to better optimization for AMD hardware in these two games. In games that don’t support ray tracing, like Total War: Three Kingdoms and Shadow of the Tomb Raider, AMD’s previous-generation Radeon RX 7900 GRE and Radeon RX 7800 XT held a sizable lead over the RTX 5060 Ti. Those cards struggled to compete with the RTX 5060 Ti in games with ray-tracing support as their ray-tracing hardware is less robust, but if ray tracing is out of the equation, they can handily beat the RTX 5060 Ti. The Radeon RX 7900 GRE's and RX 7800 XT’s performance triumph in Shadow of the Tomb Raider, in particular, was helped by the RTX 5060 Ti’s narrow memory interface, which again held it back at 1440p and 4K. We use a Kill-A-Watt wall meter to measure the power consumption of our graphics card testbed as a whole during select tests to gauge the power draw of each tested graphics card. Power consumption in gaming increased a fair bit from the RTX 4060 Ti to the RTX 5060 Ti. The performance increase outweighs this increase in power draw, but drawing more power is never ideal. However, the RTX 5060 Ti’s power consumption was considerably lower than that of the AMD competition, except for the faster Radeon RX 9070, which is more efficient overall. The gaming thermals we recorded from the PNY GeForce RTX 5060 Ti weren’t terrible, but they certainly could have been better. Most of the other graphics cards in the chart stayed cooler during the testing process. Different models of the RTX 5060 Ti with more robust thermal solutions could perform better here. However, it isn’t strictly necessary, as 70 degrees C is within the safe operating range for a modern graphics card. For as long as I can remember, I've had love of all things tech, spurred on, in part, by a love of gaming. I began working on computers owned by immediate family members and relatives when I was around 10 years old. I've always sought to learn as much as possible about anything PC, leading to a well-rounded grasp on all things tech today. In my role at PCMag, I greatly enjoy the opportunity to share what I know.

April 16, 2025 18:15 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, April 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On March 27, 2025, investors in AppLovin (NASDAQ: APP) saw the price of their shares drop $65.92, wiping out about $20 billion of the company’s market value, after prominent short seller Muddy Waters Research revealed its short position in the stock. Muddy Waters’ report comes on the heels of a recently filed securities class action lawsuit, captioned Quiero v. AppLovin Corporation, et al., No. 4:25-cv-02294 (N.D. Cal.). The suit seeks to represent investors who purchased AppLovin securities between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. Hagens Berman is investigating the claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Recent Development: On March 27, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a scathing report titled “AppLovin: Deep Data Analysis Shows APP is Just Another Scammy AdTech Company.” The report’s focus is in part on “retargeting” (a strategy that aims to re-engage potential customers who have previously interacted with a brand), “incrementality” (the additional or incremental lift in sales or conversions that a marketing activity generates), and AppLovin’s compliance with third party platforms’ TOS (terms of service). Muddy Waters contends that “APP e-commerce is Mostly Retargeting, Incrementality is Low, and it Clearly Violates Platforms’ TOS.” Muddy Waters alleges that: AppLovin Corporation (APP) Securities Class Action: The Muddy Waters report follows the filing of a securities class action complaint alleging AppLovin made false and misleading statements, while failing to disclose critical details about its flagship AXON 2.0 digital advertising platform. The company had heavily promoted the platform as "the best and fastest-growing product we’ve ever released." Investors were allegedly led to believe that the platform, which reportedly leverages “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would redefine the digital advertising landscape by enhancing ad placement efficiency and expanding into e-commerce and web-based marketing. However, the alleged narrative first shifted on February 26, 2025, when short sellers Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research published damaging reports that raised pointed questions about the company’s claims. Both research firms accused AppLovin of misleading investors regarding the platform's true capabilities and ethical practices. Fuzzy Panda Research alleged that the company violated app store policies by exploiting user data in questionable ways, predicting that tech giants Apple and Google would ban AppLovin from their app stores. Additionally, they accused AppLovin of “stealing data from Meta” as part of its e-commerce initiatives, foreseeing swift retaliation from Meta. Culper Research criticized the company for allegedly using AXON 2.0 as little more than a promotional facade to obscure the real drivers behind its business strategy. Culper's report further claimed that AppLovin's growth in mobile gaming has relied on “systematic exploitation of app permissions that enable advertisements themselves to force-feed silent, backdoor app installations onto users’ phones, with just a single click – an event that is often inadvertent thanks to the Company’s notorious UX gimmicks” and that “each illicit install translates directly to profit.” “We are investigating claims that AppLovin may have misled investors about whether its growth may be attributable to illegitimate conduct,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Netflix (NFLX) is slated to report first-quarter results after markets close Thursday, and options markets suggest traders are expecting a big stock price move in the following days. Netflix options pricing on Wednesday signaled the stock is expected to move approximately 8.5% in either direction in the week after Thursday’s report, suggesting a stock-price range of between $893.47 and $1,059.09. (U.S. financial markets are closed on Friday, which means any big move in the stock won't happen until next week.) Uncertainty is high heading into Netflix’s report, and that uneasiness is reflected in options prices for nearly all stocks. “The market is pricing in the highest average implied moves since 1Q20,” wrote JPMorgan analysts in a note on Monday. By their calculations, the average implied earnings-day move for the stocks they cover is 8.1% this quarter, compared with a realized average of 6.5% last quarter and 5.9% over the last three years. In the same note, JPMorgan compared the historical post-earnings moves of the 60 largest S&P 500 stocks and their implied volatility this quarter. They found Netflix was among the stocks with the most underestimated—or "cheapest"—post-earnings volatility. Over the past three years, the stock’s post-earnings move has averaged about 11%, making it and Meta Platforms (META) the most volatile names in JPMorgan's sample. Netflix's "cheap" implied volatility puts it in the minority. Traders are pricing in smaller-than-average moves for only nine of the 60 largest stocks in the S&P 500, according to JPMorgan's analysis. Tech giants Nvidia (NVDA), Meta, Broadcom (AVGO) and Oracle (ORCL) are among those nine. Netflix stock has jumped following each of its last two earnings reports. Shares advanced nearly 10% the day after fourth-quarter earnings topped estimates in January. The company also raised its revenue forecast for 2025 and boosted its share buyback program by $15 billion. In October of last year, Netflix beat expectations for its top and bottom lines, and indicated strong demand for its ad-supported subscription tier, sending shares soaring more than 11% the next day. Netflix stock popped on Tuesday after a report that the streaming giant is aiming to double its revenue to about $78 billion by 2030, an ambitious goal that the company hopes will propel it into the $1 trillion market-capitalization club alongside tech giants like Alphabet (GOOG) and Amazon (AMZN). Analysts are generally bullish on Netflix stock heading into earnings. Oppenheimer on Monday stuck by its “buy” rating and $1,150 price target—among the highest on Wall Street—and expressed confidence the streamer will be mostly insulated from tariffs and an economic slowdown. Netflix shares fell 1.5% on Wednesday amid a broad sell-off. Even with the decline, the company's shares are up about 8% so far this year and have risen 56% over the past 12 months.

Title: Netflix Set To Kick Off Earnings Season Well Positioned As Wall Street Weighs Recession Risk
URL: http://deadline.com/2025/04/netflix-q1-2025-earnings-tariffs-wall-street-media-1236368789/
Time Published: 2025-04-16T14:33:11Z

By Jill Goldsmith Co-Business Editor Netflix unveils its first-quarter results Thursday afternoon. The report will kick off a rather momentous earnings season for media amid churning stock markets and recession jitters prompted by the Trump administration’s global tariffs. Traditionally the company that fires the starting gun for entertainment and tech numbers every three months, Netflix may be a calming place to start this time. As tariffs cast a pall across business sectors including media, the streaming giant may be Wall Street‘s top stock pick to weather the macroeconomic storm. Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein calls it the “cleanest story” in media in the case of a U.S. or global recession. The company has little tariff exposure, sustainable 2025 growth, strong engagement data and has gotten to the other side of a round of price increases, which bug customers but enthuse profit-hungry investors. This will be the first quarter when Netflix doesn’t report subscriber numbers, but it has a number of other metrics to trumpet and has been solidly profitable for years, a claim most other streaming players can’t yet make. Watch on Deadline Netflix is only minimally exposed to advertising, which right now is ideal, after introducing a cheaper ad tier less than three years ago. A nascent business is less exposed as low consumer confidence, anticipated inflation and economic uncertainty have Wall Streeters warning of an advertising pullback. Advertising makes up a big chunk of revenue and profit at companies like Fox Corp., Paramount Global and Warner Bros Discovery to Meta and Snap. The ad business was hit hard during the past two recessions and slow to recover, which left leaving the media landscape transformed. “Given the ongoing secular headwinds facing the linear TV ecosystem, we worry that television could mirror the fate of radio and newspapers during past recessions,” research firm MoffettNathanson wrote in a recent client note. “Should budgets shift away from linear TV at an accelerated pace, we see risk of a more permanent reallocation towards connected TV and broader digital channels.” He see $45 billion in lost U.S. advertising spend versus current forecasts if GDP growth slows in 2025. To limit downside risk, the firm’s Michael Nathanson pinpoints Netflix and Alphabet as “offering compelling entry points.” The firm has “buy” recommendations on both, as well as on Disney, WBD and Meta. It has “hold” ratings on Fox, Paramount, Roku and Snap. But it also said it’s waiting to revise forecasts ahead of “further clarity during earnings calls.” It’s an understatement to say that CEO commentary over the next few weeks is highly anticipated. Beyond advertising, analysts fret about parks, which generate key revenue at Disney and Comcast, with the latter’s NBCUniversal division set to open Epic Universe in May. Nathanson notes that historical recessions (in 2001-2002 and 2008-2009) squeezed domestic parks. In the event of a recession, he predicted, Disney’s U.S. revenue would be several billion dollars below his estimates for both this year and next. Trump’s tariffs have angered U.S. allies. Airlines are sounding a cautionary note and analysts in that sector note dips in foreign travel to the U.S. in March from the year before. Jessica Reif Ehrlich of BofA Securities think Epic Universe could provide a nice boost to the sector in trying times, along with new Disney cruise ships and a rise in per capital spending at Disney parks. That said, BofA has had to rethink its outlook. “Entering the year, we were bullish on the Media & Entertainment industry in part driven by a potential cycle of M&A, but this thesis has clearly not played out (and appears unlikely) given the current Administration’s unfavorable view of some companies in our coverage,” Reif Ehrlich wrote in a note to clients. Media and entertainment, in a state of seemingly never-ending tumult, navigating Covid and then Hollywood talent strikes over the past few years, “now faces the economic uncertainty and market volatility created by the risk of tariffs.” BofA economists are not forecasting a recession but see a drag on growth that could bring the economy to the precipice. “While typical recession risk mainly impacts revenue, tariffs could lead to higher costs,” the analyst noted, in areas like raw materials for sets, or a loss of foreign tax incentives for production. She sees Netflix and Spotify as best-positioned in the field and preferred buys as both have nascent ad businesses and strong subscription models with “critical entertainment which historically performs well in a recession.” Oppenheimer’s Helfstein says that Netflix could be confronted with higher churn, weaker gross subscriber additions or subscribers trading down to cheaper plans given the deteriorating economic picture. Still, he says the firm sees “limited risk overall.” Citing a 2011 Stanford survey, he said consumers spend more time at home during economic hardship, and time spent watching TV increased during the last U.S. recession. (And we all remember the explosion of viewing and sign-ups in 2020.) Netflix is offering both secular growth, as it embarks on a new advertising revenue strategy among selective price increases, says David Joyce of Seaport Research, calling it “the best of both worlds as the low price points globally offer a great deal of value for the engagement levels – which is exhibited in good times and bad.” Generally, what makes Netflix and other streamers a “defensive stay-cation alternative if we enter a recession is that it’s likely to be one of the last expenditures cut from a consumer’s budget.” A monthly premium subscription is cheaper than a sporting event, a concert and even an Imax ticket. Although exhibitors also tend to benefit in economic downturns. He has a buy on the stock. The first quarter brought one of the company’s biggest hits ever, Adolescence, showing continued momentum after it blew past estimates to top 303 million subscribers as of the end of 2024. Loop Capital’s Alan Gould said the Ted Sarandos- and Greg Peters-led streamer should be among the most economically resilient companies in the current climate and least impacted by tariffs. For the first three months of 2025, Gould is forecasting $10.54 billion in revenue; operating income of $3 billion; net income of $2.456 billion; and diluted earnings per share of $5.63. Wall Street consensus is close at $10.51 billion of revenue; just under $3 billion in operating income; $2.473 million net profit; and EPS of $5.67, he noted, as per investment researcher VisibleAlpha. “Both we and the Street and us are expecting a small revenue, operating income and EPS beat. The quarter will benefit from about a half quarter of the price increase in the UCAN region and a month in the UK. As discussed in our March 24 report, here, engagement appears to have been up 5% for the quarter based on NFLX’s weekly Top 10 global titles in English, non-English, film and series,” Gould said in a report yesterday. “Engagement was down for the 4 weeks from late February to mid-March, coinciding with 1 month after the US price increase was fully in effect, but engagement has since bounced back the past 3 weeks.” Any and all financial metrics will be taking on increased significance when company reports after market close Thursday because – and this is big – it will be the first quarter ever Netflix won’t be revealing monthly subscriber numbers. That prospect freaked out analysts when it was floated last year although some say it has the benefit of tamping down some of the volatility around the stock, which can get buffeted subscriber numbers from quarter to quarter. Netflix has said that it will still provide that data in certain situations, like when it hits milestones. It also will likely continue characterizing growth in its ad-supported tier, using montly active users (MAUs) as the key metric, which is different from subscribers. Upbeat sentiment on the streamer accelerated this week after a WSJ report that the company’s top brass shared some ambitious goals at an annual business review with senior staff – namely, plans to achieve a $1 trillion market cap and double its revenue by 2030. The outlook included growth targets for ad sales – of $9 billion globally by 2030, and tripling operating income from $10 billion in 2024. The saga of tariffs – imposed under a Trump declared “national emergency” in foreign trade – has been fast-moving, hard to follow and value-destroying. On April 2, the administration announced sweeping tariffs targeting 60 countries with a baseline 10% tariff on nearly all remaining imports that had not been taxed already, calling it Liberation Day. Trump then announced hefty, additional reciprocal tariffs on most countries, tanking markets. He later walked those back to allow for negotiations. When China publicly chastised the administration, Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%. China quickly confirmed will cut back imports of Hollywood films, which could impact media company revenue. Last Friday, Trump suspended tariffs on electronics like iPhone and laptops from China – where most are made. But the administration also said it’s probing the “whole” tech supply chain, meaning products like chips and semiconductors may not be excluded from tariffs. He also has hinted yesterday that he might give tariff relief to certain automakers to give them more time to move production the U.S. Relief also might also extend to car components. Tariffs on a major trading partner, the European Union, will likely stay in place as negotiations appear to have stalled, according to a number of developments on Tuesday. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who has been putting out sometimes twice-daily updates on the tariff situation in recent weeks, said Tuesday that “the price impacts from this head-scratching tariff slate could result in demand destruction of 15%-20%” for new car purchases in the U.S. this year. That would add $100 million to automakers’ costs and raise the price of new cars by up to $15K. Automakers are a key advertising category. Trump’s goal is to move production back to the U.S., but that would take years after decades of globalization. “We reiterate the concept of a U.S. made car with all U.S. parts is a fairy tale fictional narrative” and not even possible now, Ives wrote. Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson has also been among those pointing out that a shift by Apple from China-based iPhone production to American manufacturing for the device, which accounts for half of the tech giant’s revenue, would take decades. Given the uncertainty, companies are unlikely to commit capital based on protectionist policies that may not last beyond 2028, Nathanson said. Entertainment, unlike auto parts or lumber or liquor or shoes, is a service, not a good, so not subject to tariffs. Of the more than 300 CEOs surveyed in April by an industry group called Chief Executive that conducts monthly polls, 62% saw a recession or other economic downturn in the next six months – up from 48% who had that forecast in March. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said during a recent interview that the U.S. may already be in a recession or getting close to one due to Trump’s tariffs. The tariff debate escalated as banks were out with quarterly numbers, the first sector to report each earnings season. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said Monday the prospect of a recession has increased amid the uncertainties of a trade war alongside growing indications that economic global economic activity is slowing. Influential JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon also said tariffs could spur inflation, weaker economic growth and, potentially, a recession. “Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,” he said in his annual letter to shareholders Monday.

Title: The FTC Discredited Its Case Against Meta In Its Opening Statement

ByJohn Tamny ByJohn Tamny, Contributor. WASHINGTON, DC - APRIL 14: The Dome of the U.S. Capitol Building is visible as FTC attorney Daniel ... More Matheson departs E. Barrett Prettyman United States Court House on April 14, 2025 in Washington, DC. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has begun an antitrust trial against Meta over the company's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp and allegations that the company holds a monopoly over the social networking market. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) “They decided that competition was too hard and it would be easier to buy out their rivals than to compete with them.” Those were the words of FTC lawyer Daniel Matheson in the opening statement of the FTC’s antitrust case against Meta. Matheson unwittingly exposed his own argument as meritless. To understand why, it’s important to remember that when Facebook purchased Instagram in April of 2012, it could claim just 30 million users at a time when Facebook’s users were already in the billion category. Which is a comment that FTC and Matheson are rewriting history in an attempt to make their case. If readers are confused, consider yet again that Instagram could claim all of 30 million users when its acquisition was announced. So, while it should be said that antitrust is always and everywhere an unfortunate look backwards by government lawyers constrained by the known, it’s no wonder that the Barack Obama DOJ and FTC didn’t raise an objection to Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram. The simple truth is that Instagram was largely unknown in 2012, and as an unknown, not at all a Facebook rival or peer. Evidence supporting the above claim can be found in the price Facebook paid for Instagram: $1 billion in cash and stock. Sorry, but such a purchase wasn’t evidence of a social media giant in Facebook buying its way out of competitive pressures, rather it was Mark Zuckerberg speculating on a future of social media that brought new meaning to opaque. In other words, if Instagram had even somewhat appeared as a future threat to Facebook or Facebook’s competition, there would have been a ferocious bidding war for Instagram that would have pushed its purchase price far, far above $1 billion. From there, consider Meta’s U.S. sales in 2025. Instagram presently accounts for 50 percent. Looking back to 2012, if Instagram had at all been seen as such a substantial future source of Facebook or Meta revenues, then the 2012 buyout price for it would once again have been far, far above $1 billion. Yet Matheson is basing his case on Facebook spending what was even then a somewhat piddling sum to ward off its oncoming status as a has-been victim of Schumpeterian “creative destruction”? Such a view isn’t serious. What is serious and dangerous at the same time is that Meta and Zuckerberg are being forced to spend precious time in court for having seen the future of social media much more clearly than their rivals. In other words, rather than rest on his wildly successful Facebook laurels, the future-seeing Zuckerberg worked feverishly to discover ways to continue to meet, and much more important, lead the needs of a social media user base that had alternate options then, and still does now. It all raises a question: since when is vastly improving the user experience with free services the stuff of antitrust violations? Tick tock, tick tock. All of which brings us back to how Matheson framed his opening statement, and most notably the case-neutering line about Facebook buying out its rivals rather than competing with them. Which means Matheson is basing his gossamer thin argument on the easy-to-discredit notion that 2012 resembled 2025 in a commercial sense. Except that it didn’t, and Meta still has its $1 billion receipt from its Instagram purchase to prove that it didn’t.

Title: 'I don't know how you couldn't be embarrassed': Wall Street is rethinking its Trump bet

Good morning. Bill Gates says AI is coming for a slew of jobs, including two that once seemed tech-proof: teachers and doctors. What will be left for us humans to do? "Retire early," Gates said. In today's big story, Wall Street dealmakers thought Trump was the answer. Now, they're not so sure. What's on deck Markets: Why I want to work on Wall Street: College students explain. Tech: OpenAI is on a hiring spree, and one area of investment stands out. Business: Realtors and Zillow are going to war, but homebuyers will pay the price. But first, Wall Street is having doubts. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. "I don't know how you couldn't be embarrassed," a managing director at a middle market-focused investment bank told BI. They were talking about the many soothsayers in Wall Street's C-suites who had bet that the new administration would revive a comatose dealmaking market. Things haven't quite worked out that way. Goldman Sachs said that the paralyzed deal market dragged revenue from deal work down 22% in the first quarter, compared with the same period last year. On every bank's Q1 earnings calls in recent days, one person loomed large: President Donald Trump. No CEOs mentioned him by name. Instead, they talked about uncertainty, worried clients, and a concerning economic outlook, BI's Reed Alexander writes. "While our corporate and consumer clients are resilient and in good financial health, the world is in a wait-and-see mode and is facing a more negative macro outlook than anyone had anticipated at the beginning of the year," Jane Fraser, the CEO of Citigroup, said. Behind the scenes, bankers told BI that they were feeling less diplomatic about the Trump administration and its tariff policies: "If you're an executive in finance and you talk to clients frequently and you understand how the world works, there's no way you can't be upset." A fuller picture of how Trump is impacting Wall Street may not emerge until the next earnings season later this summer. Many of the worst days of recent volatility happened in April — the second quarter. Whether the White House will care is another matter. 1. Netflix: Sell-off, who? Netflix's shares have climbed more than 10% in 2025, outperforming its mega-cap tech peers and a struggling broader market. Some analysts consider the stock to be recession-resistant. 2. Bring it on, Wall Street. A career path in finance can be notoriously brutal, but young people are embracing it anyway. More than 150 Wall Street-bound college students told BI their hopes, fears, and reservations about launching careers in the industry. 3. Should investors go risk-on again or stay defensive? President Trump recently hinted at a potential exemption for the auto industry. It's not the first time he's walked back on tariffs, and some investors are questioning if they should stop taking his remaining tariff threats seriously. 1. OpenAI's hiring spree. The AI startup's looking for new talent as it ramps up its infrastructure ambitions. Dozens of open roles related to AI infrastructure are listed on its website. 2. Zuck still seems salty about a failed deal from 12 years ago. Mark Zuckerberg's failed Snapchat bid from 2013 resurfaced at Meta's antitrust trial, and it doesn't sound like he's over it. He told the court Meta would've accelerated Snap's growth if the deal went through, FWIW. 3. Alphabet's supply-chain project is going solo. Chorus, Alphabet's bet on optimizing the global supply chain, is becoming an independent company, its CEO told BI. After several years under Alphabet's X incubator, the companies believe spinning it off will help Chorus move faster. 1. Realtors and Zillow are going to war. Last week, Zillow unveiled a new rule that would ban home listings that are initially selectively marketed to the public. The move takes direct aim at giant real estate brokerages — and it's bound to start an ugly fight. 2. This app wants to pay you to shop. No, it's not a scam. Claim gives users money to redeem at partner businesses each week. Its CEO told BI he wants it to disrupt the advertising sector and help combat the youth loneliness epidemic. Here's how it works. 3. Fewer planes in the skies. United Airlines announced it's cutting domestic flights by 4% starting in July, citing less travel demand. The company said it was "impossible to predict this year with any degree of confidence." The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York (on parental leave).

April 15, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, April 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP), Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRVI), e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE: ELF), and Manhattan Associates, Inc. (NASDAQ:MANH). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) Class Period: May 10, 2023 - February 25, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 The AppLovin class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period created the false impression that AppLovin’s enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform, in addition to its “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. In truth, AppLovin was exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices that forced unwanted apps on customers via a “backdoor installation scheme” which inaccurately inflated installation numbers, and, in turn, its profit figures, the complaint alleges. The AppLovin class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 26, 2025, analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures, the complaint alleges. On this news, the price of AppLovin shares fell by more than 12%, the AppLovin class action lawsuit alleges. For more information on the AppLovin class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/APP Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRVI) Class Period: August 7, 2024 - February 24, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 On February 25, 2025, before the market opened, Maravai announced it was postponing its fiscal 2024 earnings release and would delay filing its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. The Company had identified an error in revenue recognition that “resulted in approximately $3.9 million in revenue being recorded in the final week of the second quarter of 2024 upon shipment when it should have been recorded in the first week of the third quarter of 2024 upon receipt by the customer.” The Company had identified “a material weakness in its internal controls over revenue recognition.” Maravai also required additional time to “complete its assessment of a potential non-cash impairment charge related to goodwill associated with its previous acquisition of Alphazyme LLC.” On this news, the Company’s share price fell $0.87, or 21.70%, to close at $3.14 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Maravai lacked adequate internal controls over financial reporting related to revenue recognition; (2) as a result, the Company inaccurately recognized revenue on certain transactions during fiscal 2024; (3) its goodwill was overstated; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. For more information on the Maravai class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/MRVI e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE: ELF) Class Period: November 1, 2023 - November 19, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. To maintain investor confidence, e.l.f. Beauty inflated revenue and other financial measures over multiple quarters. The Company suffered from rising inventory levels. The Company falsely attributed its rising inventory to changes in sourcing. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about e.l.f. Beauty, investors suffered damages. For more information on the e.l.f. Beauty class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ELF Manhattan Associates, Inc. (NASDAQ:MANH) Class Period: October 22, 2024 - January 28, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 28, 2025 The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants provided investors with material information concerning Manhattan Associates' expected revenue for the fiscal year 2025. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Defendants' statements included, among other things, confidence in the Company's ability to forecast guidance despite macroeconomic fluctuations, the growth potential of their professional services offerings, and the ability for their cloud revenue to drive revenue for its professional services. On January 28, 2025, Manhattan Associates issued a press release reporting its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. Among other items, the Company disclosed services revenue of $119.5 million for the quarter, growing by only 0.3% compared to the year-ago quarter and falling approximately $2 million short of the guidance provided in October 2024. Manhattan Associates attributed the results to delays in professional services work and deferred deals, predicting that the Company's services revenue would reach a low point in the first quarter of 2025 and that solid revenue growth would not resume until mid-year. Manhattan Associates further revealed emerging challenges in its services business, noting that around 10% of customers with ongoing implementations had scaled back their planned services work for the upcoming calendar and fiscal year. The Company also announced that its 2025 revenues would see modest growth of just 2% to 3%, while GAAP EPS was expected to decline by 10% to 13%. On this news, Manhattan Associates' stock price fell $72.26 per share, or 24.49%, to close at $222.84 per share on January 29, 2025. Then, on February 10, 2025, Manhattan Associates announced that Eddie Capel, Manhattan's President and Chief Executive Officer, would retire from those positions effective February 12, 2025. On this news, Manhattan Associates' stock price fell $23.20 per share, or 11.55%, to close at $177.70 per share on February 10, 2025.

Title: How To Begin A WordPress Blog: A Step-By-Step Guide For Beginners

Share this article 7 Day Free Trial. Cancel Anytime. Blogging helps people express their views, opinions and insights online. Many newcomers aim to start their own site yet hesitate because they fear all the implicit technical barriers or worry about managing costs and expenses. Over time, however, platforms have adapted to match the capabilities and needs of beginners, making it simpler to get started than ever before. The following article reveals each step in setting up a WordPress blog, from picking a theme to using plugins for security and performance. Keep reading to find out how to establish your site in a straightforward manner. Before purchasing a domain or signing up for a host, it helps to think through the subject you plan to cover. A personal website can revolve around travel, cooking, product reviews, music, or any hobby that sparks your curiosity. Sticking with an area of genuine interest encourages consistent writing, which helps an audience grow. Beginners often question how specific their chosen subject should be. If a person launches a site devoted to music, for instance, they could lose track of unique angles or competition from existing publishers. Those who narrow their scope, such as focusing on a single genre or target demographic, often see steadier growth in an audience. The next step is reflecting on a name that is easy to recall, with keywords related to the topic. Reserving an available domain matching that concept means visitors will likely recognize the subject and return. A blog name typically aligns with the domain. If a blogger chooses âHelenâs Pastriesâ as a name, they might select helenspastries.com as the address, presuming it is not taken. People can verify availability on sites that offer domain searches (Dynadot, Namecheap, GoDaddy, Name.com), or hosting providers that suggest similar names. Lengthy domain names with punctuation can be more difficult to remember, so try to keep it short and to the point. After picking a domain, the next step involves selecting a host. Hosts store files, databases, and media for your blog on servers so visitors can access them around the clock. Well-known providers like Hostinger, SiteGround, and Bluehost offer beginner packages. Low-tier shared plans usually offer one-click WordPress installation and a free Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate. That helps maintain smooth loading and safe data exchange. Many packages include a free domain registration for a year, lowering setup costs further. These approximate prices reflect promotional rates, which can shift by season. Each plan typically includes email addresses and 24/7 support. Over time, upgrading to a higher tier might be wise if traffic surges. Those searching for fewer steps may opt for WordPress.com, although that path has constraints on customization and monetization options. A self-hosted approach with WordPress.org is more flexible for design control and performance tweaks. After signing up for a hosting plan, installation rarely takes more than a few minutes due to automated setup tools. You can learn more about good hosting providers at The Blog Starter â How to Start a Blog. Hosts vary slightly, but most present a button or installer labeled âInstall WordPressâ in their dashboards. After clicking, the system installs core files, configuring them behind the scenes. When that completes, you receive login credentials for the admin panel, accessible at yourdomain.com/wp-admin.Â Note: If you ever need to install WordPress manually, itâs known for its â5-minute installation.â This involves downloading WordPress from WordPress.org, uploading the files to your server, and running the setup script. However, beginners rarely need to do this thanks to managed hosting tools. After installation, you can log into your WordPress admin dashboard by visiting yourdomain.com/wp-admin and entering the credentials you set. Newer versions of WordPress may prompt you with a setup or welcome wizard to configure the basics. In the WordPress dashboard, go to Settings â General to set your Site Title and Tagline. The title is your blogâs name (displayed in the browser tab and header), and the tagline is a short phrase that describes your site. For example, Site Title: Travel with Amy, Tagline: Adventures around the world. You can change these anytime. Next, configure SEO-friendly URLs (permalinks) from the start. Navigate to Settings â Permalinks and choose the âPost nameâ option for your URL structure. Using the post name (e.g., yourdomain.com/my-first-post) makes links descriptive and human-readable. This structure is considered the best choice for most sites due to its user-friendliness and SEO benefits Some WordPress dashboards automatically enable an SSL certificate to secure traffic. If not, consult the hosting dashboard or contact support to activate SSL. That changes your address to https:// for added data protection. In addition, remove default content, such as the sample post âHello World,â so you can start fresh. Spend a few minutes exploring the WordPress admin dashboard. Key areas include Posts (for blog posts), Pages, Appearance (themes and customization), Plugins, Settings, and Users. Knowing where things are will make the next steps easier.Â Readers appreciate an orderly, attractive layout that helps them find topics. WordPress relies on themes to control colors, fonts, and structural design. A WordPress theme controls your blogâs design, layout, and style. Upon installation, WordPress activates a default theme (which may look plain). Youâll likely want to switch to a theme that matches your style and niche. In your dashboard, go to Appearance â Themes â Add New. You can browse over 7,000 free themes in the WordPress.org repository by popularity, latest releases, or feature filtersâ . Each theme includes a live preview, giving a sense of how titles, menus, and images appear. Popular ones are: Plenty of other themes exist, yet these remain frequent go-tos because of their consistent updates and user forums. When you find a theme you like, use the Live Preview to see how it would look on your site (with placeholder content). Keep in mind the preview is just an example; youâll customize the details later. Once youâre satisfied, click Install, then Activate to apply the theme to your blogâ. With your theme active, navigate to Appearance â Customize (this opens the WordPress Customizer, or Site Editor for some themes). Here you can adjust key design elements: Logo, Colors, Fonts, Headers, Menus, etc. Some newer themes (called block themes) use Full Site Editing, where you edit the whole layout with blocks. If you chose a block theme, the Customizer might be replaced by a Site Editor (under Appearance â Editor). The idea is similar â you can edit headers, footers, and templates visually. Test your new theme on multiple devices or screen sizes. You can resize your browser or use WordPressâs preview options to see how your site looks on mobile and tablet. Responsive themes should automatically adjust, but always verify that text is readable and images scale properly on smaller screens. Remember, though: Customize gradually! You donât have to perfect your design all at once. Get the basics in place (logo, colors, menu) and launch your site. You can always refine the appearance over time. Many successful blogs start with a simple theme and evolve their design as they grow. WordPress plugins add optional features to expand your siteâs capabilities, from SEO tuning to spam detection. To add a plugin, go to Plugins â Add New in your dashboard. You can search for plugins by name or functionality. Always check the pluginâs reviews, active installations, and last updated date to ensure itâs reputable and compatible with your WordPress version. Install and activate the plugin, then configure its settings (many plugins add a menu item or settings page).Â Tip: Try not to go overboard with pluginsâinstall only what you need. Each plugin can potentially affect site speed or security, so quality is better than quantity. The above four categories (SEO, caching, backup, security) cover the essentials for a solid foundation. Â Some must-have plugins stand out: While each plugin delivers a beneficial function, installing too many at once can slow a site down. Stick to core essentials, then expand carefully. Always check that each plugin remains updated, because older versions sometimes contain flaws. A blog can offer more than routine articles. Readers often look for pages like âAbout,â âContact,â and âPrivacy Policy.â These show who you are, how to reach you, and the ways you handle data. Privacy disclosure can prove beneficial if you collect any user details. Once the basic pages are ready, craft your first post.Â Go to Posts â Add New to open the WordPress post editor. Hereâs how to craft your first post: A short piece might suffice as an opener, but regular writing leads to a more engaging site.Â Many bloggers aim to post at least once per week, although that target can vary by schedule. Readers often appreciate consistency, so if you prefer monthly posts, simply keep to that timeline. WordPress can also schedule upcoming posts automatically, which helps maintain momentum. Search engine optimization affects how people discover your site.Â Remember that SEO is a gradual process. You likely wonât rank on the first page of Google overnight, but by consistently applying these practices, your content can gain visibility. See some of the key SEO tips below. On-Page SEO Best Practices: To attract readers from search engines, optimize your content and site structure: Some consider once the theme is applied and posts are published, the job is complete. Yet regular maintenance aids uptime, security, and performance. WordPress and plugin creators issue updates that remove bugs and vulnerabilities. Check the admin panel weekly for update notices. One of the simplest yet most critical security measures is to keep your WordPress core software, themes, and plugins up to date. Updates often include fixes for security vulnerabilitiesâ. In your dashboard, youâll see update notifications whenever a new version is available. Get in the habit of checking for updates regularly (WordPress can also auto-install minor core updates by default). Enable auto-updates for plugins and themes if your site environment allows it, but be cautious â occasionally an update could introduce a compatibility issue. A good practice is to run backups before applying major updates, so you can roll back if something goes wrong. Remove any plugins or themes you arenât using. Inactive plugins and themes can still pose security risks if left on your server.For instance, if you tried out a plugin but decided not to use it, delete it entirely. Similarly, you might switch themes during setup â feel free to delete old themes except one default theme (WordPress requires at least one theme installed). Having fewer add-ons reduces potential vulnerabilities and also makes your site leaner. (Best practice: remove unused plugins/themes or at least keep them updated if you canât remove them During WordPress installation, you set an admin username and password. Make sure your administrator username is unique (avoid the default âadminâ username, as that is the first guess for hackers)â Even though we set up a backup plugin earlier, itâs worth reiterating: maintain regular backups as part of your maintenance routine. Backups not only help with security incidents (like restoring after a hack) but also with any site crash or accidental content deletion. Test restoring a backup at least once (perhaps on a staging site or locally) so you know the process works. Many backup plugins can be set to automatically delete old backups to save space; configure those limits according to your storage capacity. If you enabled comments on your blog posts, check the Comments section in the dashboard periodically. Mark spam comments as spam (your Akismet plugin will catch most). Approve legitimate comments and reply to them to build community. Also, promptly delete any toxic or inappropriate comments to keep your site welcoming. Adjust discussion settings to your comfort â for example, you might require that a comment author has a previously approved comment or that all comments await moderation, which can control spam and troll comments. Part of maintenance is also reviewing your content occasionally. As your blog grows, update older posts if information changes or if you can improve them (this helps SEO and keeps content fresh). Check for broken links with a plugin or online tool (broken external links can frustrate readers and hurt SEO slightly; update or remove any broken links you find). Readers who sense sincerity and accuracy often return. That means double-checking facts, linking to reliable references, and disclaiming if a statement reflects personal experience. Inserting quotes from experts or sources can anchor your words in real-world context. People also appreciate a blog design free from pop-ups or intrusive ads. While ads can generate revenue, excessive promotion early on might frustrate newcomers. Prioritize a stable reading experience so that your site remains inviting. Selecting high-quality images can support your discussions. For instance, a food blog with crisp, properly lit images of completed dishes may gain fans faster. Similarly, a travel blog might feature original photos from trips. Avoid using copyrighted images without permission. Stock photo websites grant licenses for general purposes, so check usage terms before uploading. Over time, blog owners can encourage comments by replying promptly. Readers interested in a topic sometimes have questions, so providing answers fosters engagement. Those interactions can shape future posts or spark ideas for expansions. It also helps to incorporate a contact page or form so that visitors can reach out privately. Sometimes, they want to suggest improvements or ask about collaborations. If you plan on affiliate partnerships or sponsored articles, follow transparent guidelines by disclaiming any benefit. This practice instills trust. Maintaining social presence can further expand a blog. Each new entry can be shared on platforms like Twitter or Instagram. Many readers discover posts through these channels rather than direct searches, so a consistent effort helps you remain visible. Keeping the site up to date means ensuring the theme and plugins stay current. Changes in web standards affect WordPress over time, prompting new features or best practices. If your theme is no longer supported by its developers, or if a plugin remains unmaintained, it might be time to switch. Readers hoping to start a WordPress site can adopt this method for a thorough, well-structured online presence. They begin by settling on a topic and searching for a domain that matches their theme. Selecting a reliable host secures a stable foundation, with automated WordPress installation removing the bulk of the technical load. Next, they pick a theme that looks appealing across various devices. Adding a few essential plugins ensures protection, provides caching benefits, and helps with website optimization. When creating pages, offering an âAboutâ section promotes an authentic connection with visitors, while a âContactâ page enables constructive interaction. That steady building process continues after the first posts go live. Bloggers can keep refining their craft, analyzing traffic data, and seeking feedback to shape subsequent material. Any site worth visiting includes elements like trust, strong style, and clear intent. Posting valuable content on a consistent basis fosters loyal readers. The steps listed here form a reliable approach for beginners who crave a quick start. By investing time in meaningful posts and practicing safe maintenance routines, owners often develop a unique platform that resonates with individuals worldwide.

Title: Internet Governance - The End of Multi-Stakeholderism?

Internet Governance - The End of Multi-Stakeholderism? April 2025 When the Internet outgrew its academic and research roots and gained some prominence and momentum in the broader telecommunications environment its proponents found themselves to be in opposition to many of the established practices of the international telecommunications arrangements and even in opposition to the principles that lie behind these arrangements. For many years, governments were being lectured that the Internet was special, and to apply the same mechanisms of national telecommunications and trade regulations to the Internet might not wreck the entire Internet, but they would surely isolate the nation that was attempting to apply these measures. Within this broad category was the notion that conventional means of conducting trade in services was not applicable to the Internet. While an early mantra of âThe Internet must be free!â quickly foundered when it encountered pragmatic realities of trying to pay the bills, the next mantra of "Don't tax the Internet!" gathered significant momentum. What was meant here was an admonition to governments not to attempt to unduly constrain the flow of data with taxes and related imposts, as such actions applied in a careless manner was likely imperil the future value of the Internet. This was a unique opportunity to take the role of public communications away from the sclerotic and bloated telephone monopolies and apply some of the vibrant innovative energy that was driving the computer industry into the communications realm. But while the Internet might have had some claim to exceptionalism in the 1990s, such a characterisation was unsustainable in the longer term. It was clear by the time of the millennium that the previous regime of national telephone operators and the treaties that governed the international aspects of this global service had been sidelined. The Internet was sweeping all before it and each time it engaged with another sector it appeared to emerge from the encounter as a clear victor. The Internet might still be exceptional, but by the millennium it was recognised that it was not always exceptional in a good way. In 2003 and 2005 the United Nations hosted the two-part World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) to try and come to terms with these changes, and ideally to try to ensure that all economies would benefit from this revolution in computing and communications. This WSIS summit was in the context of the emergence of the so-called information society and a recognition of a widening digital divide where richer nations were in an obvious position to exploit the possibilities that opened up with the combination of abundant computation and communications services and thereby amass further wealth, while poorer nations yet again found themselves on the other side of the divide. Far from being a tool to help equalise the inequities in our world by allowing all to access information, education and open global markets for their services, the Internet appeared to be yet another tool to further entrench this divide between rich and poor. The United States was a focal point in these discussions. At the time the Internet was still strongly associated with the United States, and the US had spent much of the previous decade both promoting its benefits and profiting from the revenues flowing into US companies that were early adopters of Internet-based services. This promotion of the Internet and the free flow of information was certainly not without elements of self-interest on the part of the US, as it appeared that the interests of the newly emerging corporate behemoths of the Internet and the geo-political and geo-economic aspirations of the US appeared to have much in common. However, it's often difficult to tackle the larger picture in these large-scale international forums, so it was no surprise to see attention turn to the individual elements that were contained within this picture. One of these elements that became a topic of discussion in its own right was the status of the body that oversaw the Internet's protocol parameters, including the names and IP addresses, that are used as part of the central core of the Internet. This function, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) was originally part of the US Defence Advanced Research Project Agency's funded activities. After a few more changes within the US Government agency landscape responsibility for this function was shifted to a self-funded mode operated by a private sector entity, ICANN, with some level of US engagement remaining in place. This was variously portrayed as a control or as a safeguarding measure. Irrespective of the nature of the motivation, the result was that the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, part of the US Department of Commerce, oversaw a contract between the US government and ICANN regarding the operation of the IANA function. Perceptions matter, and the lingering perception here was that the Internet was still seen to be essentially under the control of a single sovereign state, the United States. This unique US role was always going to be a problem for other nations. The international telephone and postal networks were governed by international treaty instruments that had been in place for more than a century. To have a single nation state positioned at the apex of this Internet structure was, to say the least, controversial. Naturally this was a major topic in 2003 at the first WSIS gathering. The UN Secretary General at the time, Kofi Annan, convened a Working Group on Internet Governance (WGIG), a grand title which either conflated this topic to an even greater level of prominence or appropriately stated its central importance to the entire set of concerns with the structure of the Internet at the time. Again, opinions vary here. There was no clear consensus coming out of this WGIG activity, and the 2005 WSIS gathering could not reach any form of agreement on this matter. During the WSIS process the US apparently refused to consider any changes to its pivotal role in the management of the Internet's protocol parameters. The WSIS summit eventually agreed on a compromise approach that deferred any determination on this matter and instead decided to convene a series of meetings that would discuss on the underlying policy principles relating to Internet Governance. We saw the inauguration of a series of Internet Governance Forum (IGF) meetings. These forums were intended to be non-decisional forums for all stakeholders to debate the issues. Originally intended to be convened for a period of five years, culminating in the fifth IGF meeting in Vilnius, Lithuania in 2010, it has continued with a further five-year extension of its mandate, and then a ten-year extension, culminating with the forthcoming IGF meeting in Norway at the end of June 2025. Even within its limited objectives of being a forum for little other than talk the IGF would find it challenging to claim universal success in achieving its mission. The IGF did not manage to address the underlying tensions relating to the pivotal position of the US in the Internet. In 2011 we saw the IBSA proposal (called IBSA because of a summit convened by India, Brazil and South Africa) for a UN committee in Internet Related Policy. In 2013, as a reaction to the US surveillance stories being publicly aired on Wikileaks, a number of internet organisations, including ICANN, the RIRs and the IETF released the "Montevideo Statement" calling on the US to step back from its central role. The US surveillance disclosures also appeared to be a major factor in Brazil's sponsorship of the 2014 netMundial initiatives, which also appeared to have the support of ICANN. Once more the call was for the cessation of the US control over the Internet's protocol parameter function. At much the same time Edward Snowden released a set of material that documented how US agencies were undertaking of widespread surveillance using the Internet. These Wikileaks and Snowden disclosures weakened US resolve, and in October 2016 the previously unthinkable happened. The US government signed away its functional role and passed control of the protocol parameter function to an independent ICANN. If the IGF was the forum to discuss the public policy issues related to the privileged position of the US Government with respect to the Internet, then the principle rational for the IGF also finished in October 2016. In theory at any rate the US no longer claimed the ability to place its finger on the scale with respect to the carriage of these matters. On the other hand, this is perhaps a far too narrow a definition of the role and scope of the IGF. The IGF process has managed to gather a more sophisticated shared understanding of the layers within the Internet and the ways in which these various components both share common objectives and create tensions when competing to achieve similar objectives. The elements of carriage networks, consumer devices, servers and service delivery networks, applications, and application behaviours all operate in a semi-autonomous manner. The previous model of the locus of control of an entire service environment sitting within the telephone company within each nation state was not repeated with the Internet. The Internet has exposed each of the various component service activities as discrete activities, and instead of orchestrating these components within the framework of the procurement processes of the larger service entity, a variety of new markets have been exposed: technology standards, fibre and mobile services, computers in all forms from handsets to servers, applications, service providers and content publishers all operate semi-autonomously, and the orchestration of their actions is through markets and market interactions. The Internet is not operated by a single service delivery company, nor is it a defined destination. It is a series of inter-twined markets. The implication for governance processes was profound, and the IGF has managed to both expose this change and steer a constructive path of commentary and dialogue on these changes as they have happened. I'd like to nominate three major themes of national and international interest in today's Internet that have some relevance to the topic of Internet governance. The first is the issues that can still be summarised as the digital divide. There are still the haves and have nots across the full spectrum of our world. The digital divide is as big as it ever was and there is no visible movement in directions that might be able to ameliorate the societal impacts of these changes. If anything, this divide has further broadened in scope. In absolute terms it may be the case that more individuals have some form of internet access than was thought could possibly be achieved even 10 years ago. But today that's still only one half of the world's population, and the other four billion people are isolated from the mainsteam. The divide also operates across other dimensions, including the cost of access, the quality and speed of access, the accessibility of information, the extent to which goods, services and information are accessible using a local language. They all form subtle aspects and not so subtle aspects of digital exclusion. But when we talk of a digital divide we can broaden our view and look at the position of the world's most valuable digital enterprises, namely Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta, which have a market capitalisation of some 12 trillion USD (just before the recent Trump-induced stock meltdown). The aggregate position of these six enterprises is so large and so powerful that everybody else, individuals, corporates and most governments, find themselves on the impotent side of this digital divide. The second theme is also not a new theme, but it has dramatically increased in importance in the past two decades. Its components have various labels, including Cyber Security, Malware, Abuse, Spam and Viruses. It can be summarised in the observation that today's Internet is a toxic place that not only provides haven for various criminal and fraudulent activities but also provides haven for darker actions encompassing the current set of concerns relating to terrorism and cyber-offensive tactics from state-based actors. The uncomfortable observation is that technology-based counter-measures may be failing us and the fabric of our society seems to be very vulnerable to concerted hostile cyber-attack. We've adopted strong encryption in many parts of the environment as a means of protecting users against various forms of organised surveillance, but in so doing we've turned off the lighting that would otherwise expose various acts of malfeasance to our law enforcement bodies. We have had to make some tough decisions about balancing personal privacy and open attribution. But this lack of clear attribution and greater ability to embed communications behind strong encryption means that various forms of policing this digital world have become expensive, frustrating and ultimately very selective in its application. There is also the observation that these digital megaliths have made vast profits from their dominant position, while at the same time they have managed to transfer the costs of large-scale deployment of poor quality software and tools back on the public sector. The third theme lies within the changes occurring within the Internet itself. In recent years we've seen the proliferation of content distribution networks that attempt to position all of the data and services that any user would request as close as possible to the user. It used to be the role of the network to bring the user to the content portal, whereas these days we are seeing content shifting itself ever closer to the user. In and of itself that's a relatively significant change to the Internet. The public carriage component of the Internet is shrinking and being replaced by private feeder networks that service these rapidly expanding Content Distribution Networks (CDNs). The bigger question concerns the residual need for global names and addresses in this CDN-centric environment. The Internet is no longer a telecommunications network that carriers user traffic across a common network. Today's Internet is a content distribution network that is very similar to a television broadcast network where the transmission component is limited to the last mile access network. The essential difference here is that on the Internet each user can define their own program. One possible response to these concerns is the perception that these situations are instances of collective failure of the Internet Governance framework. Allowing the private sector unfettered control of the public communications space has produced very mixed results. Yes, the obsessive concern with catering precisely to what users want has produced a remarkably efficient and capable supply chain that can bring the economies of massive scale to market of a single unit, and this is a modern-day marvel. But at the same time the private sector is largely uninterested in the general health and welfare of the larger environment and the internet appears to be the victim of such collective neglect. The public sector's forbearance with the cavalier attitude shown by various Internet players may be reaching a breaking point. The EU initiative with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a clear signal that the honeymoon with technology is over and various national regimes clearly want to see a more responsible and responsive attitude from these players to public concerns. Doubtless we will continue to see fines being set at levels intended to be eye-watering for even the largest of players. While this measure has the unintended side-effect of eliminating the smaller players from the market and potentially stifling competition, a major public sector goal is to bring some sense of broader social responsibility back to the major players. This regulatory stance will no doubt continue in both the EU and in many other regimes. But is this increased national engagement a failure of the Internet Governance framework or a failure of a more conventional role of public sector regulation of a market? Private corporate entities have a primary duty to their shareholders, and do not necessarily have the same over-arching obligation to the public good. If self-interest and public interest coincide, then that is a wonderful coincidence of fortune, but when they differ, corporate self-interest necessarily wins. It is naive to expect that any messages of constraint and prudence to the private sector would be heeded unless it has the authority of regulatory impost with some form of punitive enforcement measure. If governments are feeling emboldened to enact regulatory measures for an industry that until now enjoyed some level of immunity from conventional social responsibilities, then how do these same governments feel about the actors that look after the elements of Internet infrastructure? The recent erratic moves by the US President to initiate a trade war on a global scale will have far-reaching implications far beyond stock markets and will inevitably include the digital world and what we refer to as Internet Governance. The US moves on the unilateral imposition of tariffs can be interpreted as a vote of no confidence in global trade and open markets by the US, and a resurgence of a theme of strategic national self-reliance in all areas of economic activity, including the digital realm. The question of course is how will others react? This week I saw a notice from a DNS hosting provider relating to hosting Russian domain names: "We are contacting you about a recent communication from the Russian Federal Service for Supervision in Communications and Information Technologies and Mass Media (Roskomnadzor). This relates to the potential future restrictions on foreign hosting providers and the need for domain administrators who use foreign DNS infrastructure to transition to Russian hosting providers listed in the official register." There is a visible concern in many national regimes that large amounts of their digital infrastructure are being operated by foreign enterprises, and by "foreign" it is more often than not simply "US". Today's deregulated digital communications environment is held together by commercial contracts and the extent to which such arrangements can be torn asunder by seemingly erratic US presidential edicts no doubt causes many to lose sleep! In a bad case scenario, can these US entities be coopted to hold a country's digital infrastructure hostage as part of the âartâ of a national trade deal? In the extreme worst-case scenario, can these entities be forced to operate in an overtly hostile and disruptive manner in terms of services provided to foreign entities? What happens in a modern national digital economy when its infrastructure underpinnings are deliberately sabotaged by such entities acting under duress from some form of executive order? The order in which we operate the Internet today is held apart from the conventional treaty body for communications (the International Telecommunications Union, or ITU) because the US administration in the late 1990's under President Clinton led a coalition of friendly economies notably Australia, Canada, Japan, and the EU in supporting the move to recognise a private institution to perform the allocation and administration functions for internet infrastructure elements (notably names and addresses) based on what we came to call "multi-stakeholderism. The US recognition of this form of industry self-regulatory governance was more like an insubstantive veneer for many years, as the US administration (in the guise of the NTIA within the Department of Commerce) performed an oversight role of the root zone of the DNS in the background. However, as we've already noted, the US administration backed out of this oversight role around a decade ago and has largely disengaged, being unwilling to continue to pay the diplomatic price of being the backstop in holding this coalition together in the face of large-scale devaluation of US international diplomatic capital by the Wiki Leaks and Snowden incidents. You could argue that by 2020 the job was done in any case. The "value" of the Internet was tightly held by a small elite of truly massive US enterprises and any role of the US administration to support these enterprises in the international realm was no longer necessary. Other countries have been willing to go along with these arrangements for a variety of reasons - there was the ill-defined promise of digital prosperity and other national communities could benefit from this shift to digital infrastructure as well. But the distribution of wealth and social power in this "new" world is vastly different from the old industrial world. Having valuable digital enterprises domiciled in a nation does not translate to widespread economic prosperity. The digital enterprise does not rely on large workforces, and the immense concentration of wealth often results in inventive efforts to avoid conventional forms of corporate taxation by the state. The issue is that the distribution of this digital wealth is very uneven and while a small clique of individuals may live in an extreme level of opulence, large proportions of domestic populations are disenfranchised and marginalised. Not unsurprisingly, we are now seeing a response to this situation, in the form of a wave of populism gain social power in many national communities: Not just in the US, but in Germany, France, Hungary, the UK and other western economies. Such populism is based in part on restoring an old-world order that "protects" national economies and eschews many forms of globalism. At the moment this is being expressed in various ways in a visible shift to national compartmentalism, not only in limiting the cross-border flow of physical goods through the imposition of punitive tariffs, but in the efforts to contain digital assets and infrastructure roles to national entities, domiciled within national boundaries. Obviously, this is not looking good for the Internet. It is increasingly likely that we will return to an order where international dealings are strictly defined through the use of a myriad of regulations overseen by treaty-based organisations. It's extremely challenging to espouse the benefits of an open multi-stakeholder global communications environment when the dream has been so basely corrupted by the exploitative excesses of the small clique of digital megaliths. The year 2025 is particularly challenging when WSIS+20 is reopening the basic debate about the merits of multi-stakeholderism. âNational Internet Sovreignityâ is a powerful meme these days and multi-lateralism, as compared to multi-stakeholderism, has a seductive appearance of addressing demands for greater levels of national autonomy, particularly in communities where populism is a dominant social force. This debate is taking part in an environment when the change in the stance of the US administration has effectively torn up all the old order. It is unclear as to how (or even whether) the US will continue to expend effort to support multi-stakeholderism, and the erratic record of the US on the recent topic of tariffs lends further credence to the stance that the US in no longer a widely trusted and stable advocate of the benefits of multi-stakeholderism in the international realm. In mid-2024 we saw efforts by others national entities (AUDA for .au, CIRA for .ca, InternetNZ for .nz, and Nominet for .uk) to create a coalition to speak up for mult-stakeholderism (A Technical Community Coalition for Multistakeholderism (TCCM) is evidence of others attempting to fill this clear gap. Notable is the absence of the US. I wish this group well, but it is extremely challenging to make the case that today's international climate is in their favour. Given the huge issues in cyber-vulnerabilities, the entrenched position of US megalithic digital corporates, and the extremely erratic position of the US administration at present, the case that the ideals of the Internet that were espoused in WSIS some 20 years ago, and the promises of multi-stakeholderism in the development of digital economies where everyone benefits are still realistic prospects today is extremely hard to make. Itâs far easier to observe that we gave it a try and Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta should be grateful to us for enabling their rapid rise to global dominance. I can't help but feel very pessimistic about the coming years. The attempt to coopt private enterprises to work in a manner that safeguards the public interest in our common public telecommunications realm has failed, again. It reminds me of Theodore Vail's efforts in the early 20th century to do a deal with the US Congress to bestow on AT&T a monopoly in national telephone services in exchange for an undertaking that the company would act with restraint as an enlightened private sector entity that would act in the national public interest. As it turned out AT&T could not resist itself from exploiting its monopoly position for any more than a decade! It looks like national pressures are calling an end to multi-stakeholderism in Internet Governance, hastened by a tectonic shift in the position of the US in international circles. The most likely direction we will now pursue in Internet Governance is a shift to multi-laterism and an increased role for the United Nations and the World Trade Organisation for the middle-ranked nation states, accompanied by a tumultuous period of US unilaterism. Is this all due to the outcome of the 2024 US Presidential election? If there had been different candidates and a different election outcome, would the position we find ourselves be in today be materially different? It seems to me that there are much larger social forces at play that transcend individuals and their actions, however erratic they may be! We are embarking on changes in our society which are as dramatic and even as traumatic as the industrial revolution of the nineteenth century. Such revolutions leave a trail of social dislocation and uncertainty in their wake, and this information revolution is no exception. It is perhaps unsurprising that nation states tend to be more assertive in such situations as they try and mitigate some of the worst excesses of such social disruptions. One side-effect of this increasing nationalistic stance is that various international institutions, both regional and global, tend to be regarded with increasing levels of distrust from these national regimes and from populist national fora. In times of uncertainty and stress nations naturally try to raise the drawbridge and attempt to insulate themselves from such disruptions by asserting greater levels of control within their own national realm. The root cause of all social dislocation is attributed to the actions of foreign bodies and they claim that greater levels of national determinism will restore some aspect of a myth of prior national greatness and prosperity. The industrial revolution was certainly triggered by the refinement of the steam engine, but the social revolution was far larger in scope than the invention of a simple mechanical device. In a similar line of thought, maybe it's not the Internet or its governance that lies at the heart of many of today's issues. Maybe it's the broader issues of our enthusiastic adoption of computing and communications that has formed a propulsive force for widespread social dislocation in today's world.

Last week's stock market rout was especially hard on companies like Apple, Dell, and HP that "depend extensively on manufacturing and supply chains that run through China and Taiwan." Apple certainly knew it wasn't going to dodge any trade war unscathed, "given that most of its products are produced in China." But even efforts to diversify away from China in recent years didn't save it after steep tariffs were also placed Vietnam (46 percent) and India (26 percent). It will be difficult for Apple and other companies not to pass the costs on to consumers. Wall Street analysts, for instance, have calculated that all the tariffs planned for computer equipment will raise the $799 price of the cheapest iPhone 16 model to over $1,140. Tech companies that hardly import anything are also getting battered, said Mike Isaac in The New York Times. Tech giants like Meta and Google that rely on digital advertising collect billions from "small and medium-size businesses" from around the world that are likely to "spend less on advertising" in the United States. Meta is particularly vulnerable. Roughly "10 percent of its revenue in 2023 was from Chinese companies spending heavily on advertising." Temu and Shein, Chinese e-commerce platforms, are expected to practically disappear after Trump closed the trade loophole that allowed them to sell cheap products in the U.S. Tariffs will even "boost costs for businesses building the infrastructure to deliver artificial intelligence," said Isabelle Bousquette in The Wall Street Journal. Trump exempted semiconductors from tariffs for now. But everything from the price of steel used to build data centers to the wiring inside of them is under the threat of taxation. Tech lobbyists are still hoping that tariffs bring Europe to the negotiating table, said Brendan Bordelon and Gabby Miller in Politico. Silicon Valley has for years "been complaining about foreign regulations on their platforms—taxes, fines, and restrictions that the U.S. doesn't impose." One of their biggest hopes was that Trump's tariffs would finally make European countries back down. They still might. But for now, the EU is suggesting it may "double down," hitting U.S. tech companies even harder in a counterstrike that can easily snowball into a tech cold war. Escape your echo chamber.

Remember, billionaire tech leaders lined up behind President Trump at his inauguration, said Will Oremus in The Washington Post. After he has forged ahead with antitrust lawsuits, reneged on his pledge to ban TikTok, and launched a global trade war that shaved $1 trillion in tech firms' value, it looks like Trump "may not have tech interests at heart after all."

Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg takes the stand in historic antitrust trial that could force breakup of Meta

Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm. Brian Witte, Associated Press Brian Witte, Associated Press Barbara Ortutay, Associated Press Barbara Ortutay, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took to the witness stand on the first day of a historic antitrust trial to defend his company against allegations it illegally monopolized the social media market. The trial could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups Meta bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses. WATCH: How Meta’s blockbuster antitrust trial could have major implications for big tech FTC attorney Daniel Matheson called Zuckerberg as the first witness, as it seeks to prove that Meta acquired Instagram and WhatsApp to preserve its monopoly in the social networking space. At the trial, Matheson focused on a communication sent to colleagues that illustrated Zuckerberg’s frustration with a lack of progress on developing a photo-sharing app to compete with Instagram’s. “The way I read this message is that I’m not happy about how we’re executing on that project,” Zuckerberg said. Matheson followed up by asking if that was because of Instagram’s rapid growth. “That does seem to be what I’m highlighting,” Zuckerberg said, adding that he’s always urging his teams to do better. Later in the day, Zuckerberg appeared frustrated when Matheson asked him about his concerns expressed about how fast Instagram was growing. “I don’t have the full timeline of Instagram’s development in my head,” Zuckerberg said, when Matheson asked him about his mention of its growth. “You could probably get that better from somebody else.” Matheson also asked about comments of plans to keep Instagram running, while focusing on Facebook and not investing in Instagram. Zuckerberg said he wouldn’t characterize it as a plan, and he insisted that Instagram wasn’t neglected. “In practice, we ended up investing a ton in it after we acquired it,” Zuckerberg, who testified most of the afternoon, said. In opening statements, Matheson said Meta has used its position to generate enormous profits even as consumer satisfaction has dropped. He said Meta was “erecting a moat” to protect its interests by buying the two startups. Mark Hansen, an attorney for Meta, said the FTC was making a “grab bag” of arguments that were wrong. He said Meta has plenty of competition and has made improvements to the startups it acquired. “This lawsuit, in summary, is misguided,” Hansen said, adding: “anyway you look at it, consumers have been the big winners.” The trial will be the first big test of President Donald Trump’s Federal Trade Commission’s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta — then called Facebook — in 2020, during Trump’s first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market. Meta, the FTC argues, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing Zuckerberg’s strategy, “expressed in 2008: ‘It is better to buy than compete.’ True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.” Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and “neutralize perceived competitive threats,” the FTC says in its complaint, just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers. READ MORE: Meta agrees to pay $25 million settlement to Trump over Jan. 6 suspension lawsuit Facebook bought Instagram — then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following — in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal’s value fell to $750 million after Facebook’s stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012. Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller “acqui-hires” — a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion. WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta’s competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple’s messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC’s lawsuit “defies reality.” “The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission’s action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final. Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,” the company said in a statement. In a filing last week, Meta also stressed that the FTC “must prove that Meta has monopoly power in its claimed relevant market now, not at some time in the past.” This, experts say, could also prove challenging since more competitors have emerged in the social media space in the years since the company bought WhatsApp and Instagram. Meta’s fate will be decided by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who late last year denied Meta’s request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial. While the FTC may face an uphill battle in proving its case, the stakes are high for Meta, whose advertising business could be cut in half if it’s forced to spin off Instagram. Meta isn’t the only technology company in the sights of federal antitrust regulators, Google and Amazon face their own cases. The remedy phase of Google’s case is scheduled to begin on April 21. A federal judge declared the search giant an illegal monopoly last August. Your tax-deductible donation ensures our vital reporting continues to thrive. Support PBS News Hour now.

Title: How Are the ‘Magnificent 7’ Companies Faring Amid Trump’s Tariffs?

Time Published: 2025-04-15T13:38:39Z

To say it’s been two tumultuous weeks for the group of tech stocks dubbed the “Magnificent Seven” would be an understatement. Shares in Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META) and Nvidia have swung wildly in recent days as investors react to President Donald Trump’s volatile tariff announcements. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. The Magnificent Seven fell sharply on April 2 after Trump unveiled his so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs, which enacted a blanket 10 percent levy and higher “reciprocal” tariffs for the U.S.’s largest trading partners. That same day, 25 percent levies on imported autos and auto parts also went into effect—causing a selloff across automobile stocks. Shortly after those reciprocal tariffs took effect, on April 9, the President announced that he would pause them for 90 days—except for China, whose tariffs were raised to 145 percent. Two days later, the administration said smartphones and a list of electronics manufactured in China would be exempt from the high tariffs. The chaos has understandably caused tech stocks to ricochet. While the Magnificent Seven companies are particularly vulnerable to tariffs since three-quarters of their suppliers are located abroad, some have more to lose than others. Apple, for example, relies on China for the bulk of its iPhone production, while Amazon’s e-commerce business sources heavily from overseas. Here’s a look at how the Magnificent Seven has fared in recent days: Apple’s hardware-centric business makes it especially vulnerable to trade barriers. The iPhone maker’s share price fell 23 percent in the days following April 2. Its shares rebounded on April 9 along with the broader market after Trump’s 90-day reprieve spared manufacturing hubs like India, which produces 15 percent of all iPhones, from high tariffs. Apple shares jumped again today (April 14) after most of its products were exempt from tariffs imposed on China, which currently produces around 90 percent of iPhones. Like the rest of the Magnificent Seven, Microsoft took a hit after Trump’s initial wave of global tariffs but regained ground following the president’s temporary pause. The software giant is less exposed to trade shocks than its tech peers, thanks to a business model that leans heavily on software products. The Microsoft division that produces hardware like Surface devices and Xbox consoles made up just 21 percent of revenue, according to its latest earnings report. That cushion has helped insulate Microsoft from the volatility hammering more hardware-heavy firms. Nvidia shares, which slid alongside the market after the initial tariff news, rebounded after Trump exempted certain computer components from China tariffs. But the rally may be short-lived, as the chipmaker faces tariffs on semiconductor imports, which Trump says are on the way. (Nvidia chips are primarily made in Taiwan.) In a bid to get ahead of such levies, Nvidia today announced plans today to pour up to $500 billion over the next four years into domestic A.I. chip production. Amazon’s shares have fallen by a total of 7 percent in the past dozen days. Trump’s tariffs, especially his levies on China, are expected to hit the e-commerce giant hard as up to 70 percent of goods sold on Amazon are sourced from China. But Amazon isn’t completely reliant on e-commerce—its cloud unit AWS accounts for around half the company’s profits and won’t be as impacted by the administration’s levies as Amazon’s physical goods business. Meta may not rely heavily on hardware like some of its tech rivals, but that didn’t spare its stock from a steep drop—down more than 13 percent in just two days after April 2. Shares bounced back with the rest of the Magnificent Seven after Trump’s 90-day reprieve, but the threat still looms. The company’s core business—selling digital ads, many of them from foreign brands—stands to take a hit if global tariffs squeeze international marketing budgets. Even without a direct hardware link, Meta is far from immune to the ripple effects. (Meta’s Quest VR headsets are manufactured in Taiwan.) Like Meta, the Google parent company’s revenue primarily comes from advertising and software services. Its share price has been less volatile than some of its Big Tech peers, down 7 percent after “Liberation Day” and rebounded 10 percent after the reprieve was announced. Tesla may build its cars in the U.S., but that wasn’t enough to shield the automaker from fallout. While the company dodged the administration’s 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles, it wasn’t as lucky with car parts—30 to 40 percent of which are sourced from abroad and now face added levies. Tesla (TSLA) shares have slid more than 10 percent over the past two weeks, dragged down not just by tariff concerns but also by growing public backlash to Elon Musk’s controversial role as head of the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Meanwhile, the company has suspended new orders for its American-made Model S and Model X vehicles in China, which currently has a 125 percent retaliatory tariff against U.S. goods.

Title: The future of IRS Direct File looks grim

Time Published: 2025-04-15T12:05:32Z

Hello! It's Tax Day in America. Wishing you all luck from afar — hopefully, you don't follow in my colleague Zak Jason's steps and forget to attach your W2. And today's big story is right on theme: We're taking a look at what's going on inside the IRS. What's on deck Markets: One crucial consequence of President Trump's trade war is being overlooked. Tech: Facebook isn't about connecting with friends anymore, Mark Zuckerberg said during day one of Meta's antitrust trial. Business: These automakers are picking up the slack from Tesla's slumping sales. But first, let's talk taxes. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. How are you filing your taxes this year? You might be using IRS Direct File, the nation's first free tax-filing system. But its future is looking grim: A senior Treasury official told BI it was a failed and disappointing program used by only a small fraction of the nation's taxpayers. Sam Corcos, a DOGE official and one of the group's public faces, has also said he thinks the relatively new program should be shut down, sources told BI. The uncertainty has disappointed people who believe Direct File is emblematic of the very things that DOGE is supposed to be building, BI's Juliana Kaplan and Jack Newsham write. It's meant as a tech solution to file taxes quickly and directly to the IRS, bypassing fees to for-profit software companies. However, critics of the tool say it's too costly and wasn't implemented legally. Tax season is a source of angst for many Americans. This year, some IRS employees who have returned to the office are in the same boat. Workers under the IRS's return-to-office mandate said they've operated out of conference rooms and cafeterias, battled spotty internet connections, and navigated boxes of paperwork scattered throughout the halls. IRS employees told BI that while RTO had come with certain upsides, like leaving work at the office, the return has been tumultuous and the opposite of efficient. "People are not happy, and it's going to affect productivity going forward," one employee said. 1. An overlooked byproduct of Trump's trade: the weakest dollar in years. Typically seen as a safe haven during market volatility, the US dollar index is sitting near a three-year low. This may reflect souring global sentiment toward the US following unpredictable tariffs. 2. Webull's stock is soaring. The digital investment platform's shares spiked as much as 500% to $79.56 on Monday. Webull went public via SPAC merger after combining with SK Growth Opportunities and delaying its IPO plans in 2021. 3. Asia's auto stocks surge. Major automakers like Toyota and Honda saw significant stock gains on Tuesday after Trump said he was considering a temporary exemption on imports. 1. Apple can't catch a break right now. On Friday, the iPhone maker appeared to be off the hook on tariffs until President Trump clarified on Sunday that tech products would be subject to separate levies in the future. But Apple's China problem goes beyond tariffs. 2. Trump's trade war is putting robots to work. The robots-as-a-service company Formic said its customers have increased their robot usage this year. It's likely these brands were using robots to save money ahead of tariff-related price increases. 3. Facebook isn't really for friends, Mark Zuckerberg said. In a landmark antitrust case, the FTC is arguing that Meta monopolizes apps that share content with friends and family. Zuckerberg testified Facebook's main purpose has evolved beyond connecting with friends. 1. The biggest winners from Tesla's sales slump. The carmaker's competitors are taking bigger bites of Tesla's market share while the overall EV market grows. In the US, GM and Ford are some of the big winners, while BMW and VW are soaring in Europe. 2. Starbucks baristas' new fit. Starting May 12, Starbucks store employees will be required to wear a solid-color black top to highlight the iconic green apron. The dress code is the latest change the coffee chain has made as it tries to boost sales. 3. Pay us or give us a TV show. A Trump ally suggested Warner Bros. Discovery could please the president by offering money, programming, or both. That says a lot about the relationship between the president and the media in 2025, Peter Kafka writes.

Title: 'I’m from the technocracy and I’m here to help' - how tech bros are taking over the world
URL: https://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/Im-from-the-technocracy-and-Im-here-to-help-how-tech-bros-are-taking-over-the-world
Time Published: 2025-04-15T07:18:00Z
Full Content:
Michael Kvakin - Fotolia When I first saw the photos of all of the tech broligarchy lined up behind Donald Trump on his inauguration day something struck me as off. I couldn't figure out what was bothering me until now. I realised they didn't just look like very powerful attendees, they looked much more like very powerful shareholders in government - and unelected ones at that. We can see today where that power translates directly into US government policymaking with the reductions on certain tech tariffs from China. Let's look at what that means for Apple alone. With 90% of iPhones manufactured in China, Apple faced potential price increases of up to $3,500 per phone under the proposed 145% tariff. In 2024, US imports of smartphones from China were valued at $41.7bn while laptops were valued at $33.1bn. The tariff exemption therefore translates into avoided costs of approximately $60bn annually for these two categories alone. And while Apple will have only a share of that benefit, it's a staggering return for Tim Cook's donation of $1m to Trump’s inaugural committee - which also marked Cook’s first time attending a presidential inauguration, despite his political views often differing from Trump’s policies. But it's not only tech’s influence in policymaking areas such as tariffs that directly affect their bottom line, we need to think about their broader reach in the realm of geopolitics. Where did the ideas of making Canada the 51st State, or annexing Greenland actually emerge from? If there was a policy vacuum here it was neatly filled by none other than Elon Musk drawing on the ideas of his maternal grandfather Joshua Norman Haldeman. Haldeman was a key proponent of the Technocracy movement which started in the early 1930s in the US and then spread to Canada. It proposed the creation of the Technate of America. This would do away with borders, merging the US, Canada, Mexico, Central America and Greenland into a single nation under a regime of engineers and technicians. Sounds familiar, right? Its essential argument was that there was no room for politics in society and that engineers and scientists were best placed to decide what was best for citizens in terms of organising resources and society. In 2019 Musk tweeted on X, “Accelerating Starship development to build the Martian Technocracy”. Except now it looks like he is not waiting to do it on Mars, he's doing it here in real time. The idea of the futility of the nation state and of politics in favour of new technological frontiers is echoed in The sovereign individual published in 1997. This book examined the social, economic and political implications of the coming technology on society and particularly politics and governments. Authors James Dale Davidson and William Rees-Mogg - father of Jacob Rees-Mogg - wrote, “Representative democracy as it is now known will fade away to be replaced by the new democracy of choice in the cybermarketplace. If our deductions are correct the politics of the next century will be much more varied and less important than that to which we have become accustomed. The 20th century nation-state will starve to death as its tax revenues decline,” Or, as Mark Zuckerberg puts it, “Companies not countries”. The authors also predicted the impact of coming technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) when they wrote, “Lifetime employment will disappear as jobs increasingly become tasks or piece work rather than positions within an organisation. New survival strategies will evolve involving greater concentration on the development of leisure skills, sports abilities as well as providing services to the growing numbers of sovereign individuals as income inequality within jurisdictions rises.” The tome has had a substantial impact in Silicon Valley with Rees-Mogg travelling there more than a decade after the book's publication to discuss it with students at Stanford University. In 2014, PayPal founder and Trump advisor Peter Thiel told Forbes magazine that The sovereign individual had influenced him more than any other book. Indeed, in recently republished versions of the book Thiel has provided a new foreword. And Thiel’s investments align with these principles where he believes that cryptocurrency ventures will bypass traditional monetary systems. Expect further policy reach in the future in the provision of universal basic income (UBI), which many of these tech bros are very keen on. They understand more than most how many professions are under threat and how many people will be left without work. What are people to do when their labour is no longer required? Perhaps they will spend their time in the fantasy worlds created by technologists, doomscrolling endlessly on Insta and other platforms while being paid by the government via UBI. This is what the author Jonathan Taplin tackles in his book The end of reality when he says “That is my greatest fear: that enchanted by the magic of the Technocrats’ immutable money, infinite frontiers, eternal life we will sleep through a right-wing revolution and wake up to find our democracy gone and our children being turned into Meta cyborgs”. And if you think having Trump as President of the United States with Elon Musk as his sidekick is a nightmare, ponder if you will the dystopian prospect of Mark Zuckerberg running for the highest office. Can you imagine the data he has amassed that could be used to further his political ambitions? What opponents might be suppressed or compromised? Yet as described in Sarah Wynn-Williams recent book Careless people, Zuckerberg has already paved the way for his political ambitions from as far back as 2017 when he finally realised how important Facebook was in the election of Donald Trump. In her insider account, Wynn-Williams wrote, “He also had Facebook’s board approve a new stock structure that would allow him to run for office. The filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission expressly allows Mark Zuckerberg to leave Facebook for up to two years without losing control of the company if his absence is ‘in connection with his serving in a government position or office’.” These are not benign actors, scrappy startup founders who move fast and break things - they share world views that are destroying our democracies as we know it. Yet politicians are in thrall to the power that these men yield. We may already be existing in the new technocracy for our times. They already decide how and when we should use their products, removing our choice and agency – consider the recent inclusion of Meta AI into WhatsApp, which you cannot turn off. Ronald Reagan once said the nine most terrifying words in the English language are, “I'm from the government and I'm here to help.” So if you hear, “I’m from the technocracy and I’m here to help,” you won't be surprised if it's our new form of government.

Title: Total Control 24 (TC24) Under Review: Best Prostate Health Supplement for Men in 2025

April 14, 2025 20:14 ET | Source: Total Control 24 (TC24) Total Control 24 (TC24) New York City, April 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 1. Introduction: Prostate Health in Men Over 40 Prostate health is one of the most overlooked yet critical areas of concern for aging men. As men enter their 40s and beyond, hormonal shifts, inflammation, and lifestyle changes begin to impact the health of the prostate gland—a small but vital organ that supports urinary function and reproductive health. Recent studies reveal that nearly 50% of men in their 50s and up to 90% of men in their 80s suffer from symptoms related to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), an age-associated enlargement of the prostate. These symptoms include: For many, these symptoms emerge gradually and are often dismissed as a regular part of aging. However, untreated BPH can significantly reduce quality of life. It disrupts sleep, causes anxiety in social settings, and contributes to chronic fatigue and low mood. Most men are unaware that the underlying triggers are often tied to an overproduction of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), declining testosterone levels, and elevated oxidative stress that inflames the prostate tissue. These biological shifts reduce urinary flow efficiency, disrupt bladder function, and can impact overall male vitality. While prescription medications like alpha-blockers or 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors are commonly used, they often come with unwanted side effects such as dizziness, low libido, or sexual dysfunction. That's why more men are turning to natural prostate supplements to regain control of their health—without harsh chemicals. This brings us to Total Control 24 (TC24), a revolutionary prostate support supplement that is being recognized as a top-rated formula for prostate health in men over 40. Designed to support normal prostate size, healthy urinary flow, and hormonal balance, TC24 combines clinically researched, bioavailable ingredients into a powerful daily solution. In this in-depth review, we will examine how Total Control 24 works, explore the top prostate health ingredients, evaluate the science behind its formula, compare it with other popular prostate supplements, and outline the pricing, return policy, and customer satisfaction guarantee. If you are seeking the best prostate health supplement that delivers results naturally, Total Control 24 deserves your attention. 2. Understanding the Problem: Why You're Experiencing Prostate Symptoms As men age, prostate-related discomfort becomes increasingly common—and it's not just about getting older. Several interconnected biological and environmental factors contribute to the gradual decline of prostate function. Understanding these causes is the first step toward lasting relief and better health. Hormonal Shifts and DHT Accumulation One of the primary drivers behind prostate enlargement is the hormonal imbalance that occurs with age. Testosterone levels begin to decline in a man's 40s, while dihydrotestosterone (DHT)—a more potent derivative of testosterone—often remains elevated. DHT can cause the cells in the prostate to multiply excessively, leading to an enlarged gland that puts pressure on the urethra. This creates frustrating urinary issues, including weak stream, urgency, and nighttime urination. Oxidative Stress and Inflammation Oxidative stress occurs when there is an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants in the body. In the prostate, this can lead to inflammation and cellular damage. Chronic inflammation is a key factor in the development of BPH and may even contribute to more serious conditions if not addressed. Antioxidant-rich nutrients, like those found in TC24, help reduce this inflammation and protect the prostate against cellular breakdown. Lifestyle Factors That Exacerbate Symptoms In addition to biological changes, lifestyle habits also influence prostate health. Poor diet, lack of physical activity, alcohol consumption, and chronic stress can all worsen urinary symptoms and hormone imbalances. Additionally, high body fat can lead to increased estrogen production in men, further throwing off the delicate balance of male hormones. The Emotional Toll of Prostate Problems The daily struggle of dealing with frequent bathroom trips, poor sleep, or sexual dissatisfaction is more than a physical burden—it can affect self-confidence, work performance, and relationships. Many men report feeling embarrassed or isolated due to their symptoms, which in turn can lead to anxiety or even depression. Prostate issues are not just an inconvenience; they are an actual quality-of-life issue. The good news is that men do not have to live with these challenges. Addressing the root causes of prostate issues—hormonal imbalance, inflammation, and oxidative stress—can deliver lasting relief. This is precisely where Total Control 24 excels, providing a natural and comprehensive approach to restoring prostate health. Learn More About Total Control 24 Ingredients and How They Support Prostate Wellness 3. What is Total Control 24 (TC24)? Total Control 24 (TC24) is a next-generation prostate health supplement created by Adem Naturals. Designed specifically for men over 40 who are struggling with the signs of prostate enlargement and urinary discomfort, TC24 offers a multi-action formula targeting the key root causes of prostate decline. Rather than simply masking symptoms, TC24 works to support: This advanced supplement is manufactured in the USA in an FDA-registered, GMP-certified facility. TC24 uses a clean-label formula that is non-GMO, free of gluten and soy, and contains no artificial additives or fillers. Each capsule delivers a potent dose of herbal extracts, minerals, and antioxidants—all of which are selected for their ability to support long-term prostate health. Its formula includes several clinically backed ingredients such as Pygeum Africanum, Lipophytol®, Boron, and Myrciaria Jaboticaba, which work synergistically to promote urinary comfort and hormonal harmony. What makes Total Control 24 unique is its strategic formulation: the combination of time-tested herbs and patented nutrients designed for bioavailability, precision dosing, and comprehensive coverage of prostate and urinary functions. Whether you're just starting to notice changes in your urinary habits or have been living with BPH-related discomfort for years, TC24 presents a compelling, natural solution worth considering. The Science Behind Total Control 24 Ingredients Myrciaria Jaboticaba (Jaboticaba) Myrciaria jaboticaba is a Brazilian superfruit known for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It is rich in polyphenols such as ellagic acid and anthocyanins, which play a central role in modulating inflammation—a key contributor to prostate enlargement and discomfort. Recent research from the Federal University of Alfenas (2024) demonstrated that jaboticaba peel extract significantly reduces markers of oxidative stress and cellular inflammation. Additionally, a 2020 study published in the journal Food & Function found that its polyphenolic compounds protect DNA from oxidative damage, a critical factor in preventing cellular aging and potential mutation in prostate cells. Further evidence published in Food Chemistry (2025) and ScienceDirect highlights jaboticaba's role in reducing nitric oxide overproduction, which is often elevated in inflamed prostate tissue. This makes jaboticaba an essential component of natural prostate health formulas, helping maintain cellular integrity, reduce swelling, and support normal prostate function. Lipophytol® (Phytosterol Complex) Lipophytol® is a patented microencapsulated phytosterol complex that delivers enhanced bioavailability of beta-sitosterol and related plant sterols. These compounds are known to inhibit 5-alpha-reductase, the enzyme that converts testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone closely associated with prostate growth and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Studies confirm that beta-sitosterol can improve urinary flow, reduce post-void residual volume, and alleviate symptoms like urgency and weak stream. Lipophytol®'s advanced encapsulation ensures better stability and absorption, allowing for more consistent and reliable results. As a DHT blocker and bladder support agent, Lipophytol® helps address hormonal imbalances and urinary discomfort, two common issues affecting men with aging prostates. Pygeum africanum (African Plum Tree Bark Extract) Pygeum africanum has been used for decades in European herbal medicine to treat prostate-related urinary symptoms. Its bioactive compounds—phytosterols, triterpenes, and ferulic acid esters—exhibit both anti-inflammatory and anti-androgenic effects. According to a Cochrane meta-analysis and studies published in The American Journal of Medicine, Pygeum extract consistently reduces the frequency of nighttime urination, increases peak urine flow, and lowers the volume of residual urine. It also helps regulate hormonal activity within the prostate, contributing to symptom relief in men with enlarged prostates. With extensive clinical support, Pygeum provides multidimensional benefits, targeting inflammation, supporting hormone regulation, and improving quality of life through enhanced urinary function. Boron Boron is a trace mineral that plays a significant role in maintaining prostate health, particularly through its effects on hormone metabolism and inflammation. Research in Cancer Causes & Control (2007) and other peer-reviewed journals have shown that men with higher boron intake have a lower incidence of prostate cancer. Boron helps balance testosterone and estrogen levels, lowers prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and enhances vitamin D metabolism—all of which are beneficial for prostate tissue maintenance. It also exhibits anti-inflammatory properties by modulating cytokines and reducing oxidative stress markers. In the context of Total Control 24, boron acts as a foundational mineral that enhances hormonal balance and supports prostate health at the cellular level, especially in aging men. Discover Why Total Control 24 Is One of the Best Prostate Supplements for Men Over 40 5. What Makes Total Control 24 the Best Prostate Health Supplement in 2025 With a saturated market full of over-the-counter remedies, herbal blends, and pharmaceutical options, choosing a prostate supplement can be overwhelming. What sets Total Control 24 (TC24) apart is its combination of ingredient quality, formulation integrity, clinical rationale, and consumer-focused transparency. These attributes collectively make TC24 one of the most advanced and trusted prostate support supplements currently available. Superior Ingredient Sourcing and Formulation TC24 stands out by leveraging patented, high-quality ingredients like Lipophytol® and Myrciaria Jaboticaba, which are not found in generic prostate pills. These ingredients are selected based on rigorous scientific evidence supporting their roles in DHT regulation, inflammation reduction, and urinary support. Unlike many supplements that hide behind proprietary blends, TC24 offers transparency in its formulation. Additionally, the supplement is manufactured in a GMP-certified, FDA-registered facility in the USA, ensuring pharmaceutical-grade standards and consistent potency. The clean-label promise—no gluten, soy, artificial binders, or GMOs—further demonstrates the product's commitment to purity and safety. Multi-Pathway Mechanism of Action TC24 doesn't rely on a single mechanism. Instead, it addresses prostate health on multiple fronts: This multi-pronged strategy ensures that users experience relief from both acute symptoms (like frequent urination) and long-term risks (like unchecked prostate growth). Favorable Comparison to Leading Brands Compared to other high-profile prostate formulas such as Super Beta Prostate, ProstaGenix, and Prost-P10x, TC24 excels in ingredient diversity and synergy. While others rely heavily on saw palmetto alone, TC24 integrates a broad spectrum of targeted compounds that work together more effectively. It also offers more excellent value with precision dosing, clinical-grade ingredient selection, and better bioavailability via Lipophytol® delivery. Many competitors overlook absorption optimization, a crucial element when dealing with fat-soluble nutrients like phytosterols. Clean Label and Consumer Safety TC24 is designed for long-term use without dependency or dangerous interactions. Users can feel confident knowing they are taking a supplement that is: For aging men looking for a reliable, comprehensive, and well-formulated solution to support prostate health and urinary comfort, Total Control 24 delivers on every front. 6.

Allen R., 62 — Grand Rapids, MI "I've tried several prostate supplements in the past, but none have worked as consistently as Total Control 24.

How to Use TC24 for Best Results Consistency is key when it comes to achieving and maintaining the best results with any natural supplement—and Total Control 24 (TC24) is no exception. This section offers clear usage guidelines to help you get the most out of your investment in prostate health. Recommended Dosage Each bottle of Total Control 24 contains 60 capsules. The standard dosage is two capsules daily, taken preferably with a meal and a full glass of water. This allows for maximum nutrient absorption and ensures the active ingredients begin working effectively without causing stomach upset. Many users opt to take one capsule in the morning and one in the evening, which helps sustain consistent ingredient levels in the body throughout the day. When to Expect Results While some men may begin to notice improvements in urinary flow, frequency, and comfort within the first 7–10 days, optimal results typically become evident after 30–60 days of continuous use.
