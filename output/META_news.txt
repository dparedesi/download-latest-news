Title: 20VC x SaaStr This Week: Navan’s “Disappointing” $5B IPO, VCs Getting 6% Instead of 20%, and the Fire-Half-Your-Team AI Test: The New Venture Reality

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts We’re back! Harry, Rory and Jason this week. The venture landscape has fundamentally shifted. A $4.5B exit is no longer enough for mega-funds, ownership targets are getting crushed across the board, and if your SaaS company didn’t see AI-driven reacceleration in 2025, you’ve failed. Meanwhile, the best Series A environment in years is hidden behind pricing pressure, and every “mature” software company better be capturing dollars from the AI spend explosion—or they’re headed for a 3x revenue PE buyout. Navan’s IPO at $700M revenue, 32% growth, and a ~$5B market cap should be a massive win. Instead, it feels like a disappointment. Why? Because mature SaaS companies are now trading at 6-7x NTM revenue — or less — and with fund sizes exploding, VCs need $10B+ outcomes to move the needle. As Jason put it bluntly: “Is a $4.5 billion exit good enough today? It’s a horrible thing to say, but if we’re talking about in VC and inside baseball, it’s a bonafide question.” The math is unforgiving. Lightspeed invested $257M into Navan and returned ~$1B for a 4x blended return. Their early rounds probably returned 20-30x, but following with $200M+ in late-stage capital diluted that spectacular early return down to “just” 4x on the total investment. For a $2B fund, even a billion-dollar return only gets you a third of the way to 1x. Benchmark—the gold standard of ownership discipline—only secured 10% of Mercor at a massive valuation. Jason’s last three deals came in at 6-8% ownership despite his rule being double-digit ownership of two winners per fund. Y Combinator has institutionalized 10% rounds at demo day (3 on 30, 4 on 40), leaving seed VCs scrambling for 5-6% unless they “way overbid and basically do two rounds at once.” The paradox: Both hyper-capital-efficient companies (that don’t need much money) and hyper-capital-inefficient companies (that need billions) result in low ownership for VCs. As Rory noted: “A founder’s optimized fundraising is a VC’s below ownership target.” Jason delivered one of the spiciest takes of the episode: “You better have gotten a few nickels out of the AI expenditures.. Some growth from all that massive AI spend in 2025. If you didn’t, if you’re not growing faster at the end of 2025 than at the start, then as a founder, I give you an F minus.” The data backs him up. Twilio went from single-digit growth to 15% growth fueled by voice AI customers (top 10 voice AI startups up 10x). MongoDB is benefiting from every AI company needing databases. Snowflake has re-accelerated. Stripe is booming from AI customers. Even if you can’t become Harvey, you must co-attach to the AI spend explosion. The window is closing fast. “You had 18 months to ship a product that mattered in this world. Where’s your agent? Where’s your reacceleration? F. No more excuses after Thanksgiving.” Despite the pricing pain, Jason argues Series A is in a golden age: “This is the best of times to be a series A investor because there is just an explosion of seed AI startups… It is a gift that thousands of founders are in San Francisco raising seed funds from multiple accelerators.” The top of funnel has never been better. YC, Neo, South Park Commons, and others are creating an unprecedented pipeline of smart, vetted founders. Yes, competition is fierce—Rory noted losing deals to Andreessen Horowitz and Kleiner Perkins (firms that would have been “slightly early” five years ago). But the direction of travel is clear: “Some form of agentic software… The mission has been assigned.” Buried in the discussion of Navan’s “disappointing” IPO was a striking observation: “The amount of wealth in Silicon Valley is just unprecedented in our lifetimes. It’s just gone up dramatically the last 18 months. In a very concentrated fashion.” This creates a strange dynamic where VCs are getting richer than ever (Oren Zev as a solo investor turned $150M into $1B+, Lightspeed’s $257M became ~$1B) while simultaneously feeling the pressure to deliver even bigger outcomes. A $50M post-seed valuation for a company that “has to be way better than Navan” feels both expensive and necessary. Let’s dig deeper into why Navan’s $5B outcome feels bittersweet. The company survived a near-death experience (COVID wiping out travel), came back strong with $700M+ revenue at 32% growth, and delivered billions to investors. By any historical standard, this is spectacular. But the lockup period reveals the gap between headlines and reality. Typical lockup: 6 months before you can start selling, and 18-24 months to fully distribute a large position. As Rory explained: “The IPO, I mean, it’s significant, but the economic significance is limited.” Translation: Those “billion-dollar returns” reported on IPO day often turn into $700M after 18 months of distribution. Worse, the last private round priced at $9B. Anyone who bought at that valuation or in the IPO is now down 30-50%. As Rory noted, this actually disproves Bill Gurley’s “free money” thesis about IPO pops: “This is an example of an IPO where, you know, if you look at it from the perspective of the issuer of stock, not only did they not leave money on the table, they actually priced at what now looks like a high.” The follow-on concentration strategy amplified returns but also amplified late-stage risk. Lightspeed’s early rounds probably delivered 20-30x, but their $257M total investment (including heavy late-stage follow-on) blended down to ~4x. For Orin Zev’s smaller fund structure with SPVs, the $150M-to-$1B return (6.7x) on a single deal is phenomenal. Same outcome, different fund architecture, wildly different impact. One of the most insightful discussions centered on adoption velocity. OpenEvidence grew to 300,000 doctors in one year—one-tenth the time it took Doximity. Individual adoption of AI tools is explosive. But corporate adoption? Much slower. As Jason observed: “I don’t think everyone’s going to buy Agent Force or their equivalent in a year. It might be 5 years, not 10 like SaaS. It might be half the time of SaaS.” This creates opportunity and risk. Opportunity: If you’re selling to enterprises (Salesforce, HubSpot), you have 5 years to get this right, not 1 year. Risk: Individual users are already using ChatGPT, Cursor, and other tools “legally or illegally.” Every associate is using AI to write briefs whether law firms have adopted Harvey or not. The TAM question becomes critical. OpenEvidence might capture 300K doctors fast, but there are only ~1M doctors in America (half in-house, half external). As Rory warned: “You’ve got to be sure that once you get all the names that you have enough follow-on stories for those names. You don’t want to be one and done.” Harvey faces the same math. To justify an $8B valuation at 30% growth (7x multiple at maturity), they need to hit $3B in revenue. With ~1M lawyers in America, that implies thousands of dollars per lawyer per year in subscription—not impossible (WestLaw is bigger), but a high bar. Speaking of Harvey: $150M ARR, 98% GRR, 170% NDR, 40% DAU/MAU ratio, raised at $8B valuation with minimal dilution (~2% for $150M). Jason’s back-of-napkin math: “If it’s 400 forward revenue that’s 20x. That’s exactly what it is. 400 AR. That’s what they’re predicting.” Rory agreed: These low-dilution rounds at hypergrowth companies are great for early investors but create pressure on the ultimate exit. The bull case: LLMs are perfect for law (language manipulation is literally what lawyers do), Harvey established market leadership fast, and legal had been a “pretty barren place” for software until now. The question mark: Is there a $3B annual spend in software for corporate law practices? Rory’s framework: “You basically have to be such a big automation tool for these lawyers that they’re willing to spend, you know, equivalent dollars, you know, thousands of dollars per year in subscription to make the math work.” Jason’s evolution: “I couldn’t believe that software companies could really capture dollars from replacing humans for real… Now we’re really seeing it. Agents are better than mediocre humans.” His conviction comes from using products, not Powerpoints. He’s running 20+ agents at SaaStr, replacing $40K workers with $10K/year agents, and seeing real results. The discussion of Sam Altman’s response to Brad Gerstner (“if you want to sell your shares, I’ll find someone for you in 60 seconds”) revealed deep concerns about governance and capital requirements. Jason’s reaction: “When that was said to me by a founder, I never said a critical word ever again. I didn’t mean I didn’t realize I pushed too hard. I never said a critical word ever ever again when I was told there’s a market for your shares if you want to sell.” But Rory pushed back: “If you are on the board of a company that’s planning to spend a trillion dollars and you only have 12 billion in revenue. It’s a totally appropriate board level question to say how are we going to do this.” The stakes are enormous: “The health of the entire US economy depends on the answer to this question. It turns out ‘fuck off and sell your shares’ is not an acceptable answer.” OpenAI needs to do $100B+ in revenue by 2027 to support the capex commitments. That’s not just impressive—it’s “hundreds of billions of dollars a year in a world where today only Amazon” operates at that scale. Google does $100B in a quarter; so does Amazon. OpenAI needs to reach that level. Rory’s compassion for Sam: “There’s a little part of me that’s kind of a bit sorry for Sam Altman because of where he’s put himself. He is the poster child of the AI capex boom. And if the AI capex boom unravels and the world and media is looking for a villain to throw rocks at, it ain’t going to be a big search.” The board’s job: “Help the CEO avoid things… provide the guardrails.” When someone invents numbers at the $5-10M level and they’re wrong, they disappear. “When you invent numbers that are wildly overoptimistic at the trillion dollar level and if it unravels, you just become the poster child in every economic history for the next 200 years of the great AI crash of 2026.” AWS: Grew 20% (reacceleration from 13%), secured OpenAI deal as latest partner, but the story is bittersweet. Five years ago, AWS dominated cloud compute. Today, they’re behind Microsoft ($250B commitment), Oracle ($300B), Google, Broadcom ($400B) in the AI race. As Jason noted: “It’s tough from AWS being having really created the category of cloud and being what we all grew up on. It is a major come down to be not even above the fold on the leaderboard.” Google: The underappreciated winner. “Google is really good now at all levels. It’s really good at consumer AI. It’s really good in searches back. Search is growing for Google again. The TPUs are good. It’s a good partner.” Unlike Amazon, Google has the application layer (all the consumer apps we use), the infrastructure layer (TPUs), and is printing money. Stock up 53% from Q1 lows. Meta: Core business performed great (20% growth), but stock dropped double-digits because they’re spending $70B/year on AI with “no revenue attached.” The market’s message: “You have this wonderful business and then you’re taking the entire cash flow and you’re building this AI stuff and unlike Google, Microsoft, or Amazon you don’t have an enterprise business to sell this shit to and unlike ChatGPT you don’t yet have an obvious AI forward app.” Zuck’s response (paraphrased): “I think it’s relevant to be in this space. Thank you for your opinion. I refer you to the Artisan Corporation. I control this company. Have a nice day.” The market’s counter: “Hey you’re doing the thing you did in 2021-22 putting a whole bunch of capex into something that might not work and that’s why the shares are slightly down.” “If I were the CEOs of any of the CRM leaders, I might move on from half my leadership team if I don’t see real growth from AI agents by the middle of next year. Because there’s been enough time. You’ve just got the wrong people.” Why the urgency? Infrastructure companies like Twilio, MongoDB, and Datadog already saw the bump. Companies at the infrastructure layer get the AI spend first. Application layer companies need to prove they can capture it too—or risk being viewed as legacy players who missed the moment. Rory initially pushed back on Jason’s harshness, then came around: “Sometimes when Jason is cruel and harsh, I disagree. And then sometimes I listen and I go, he’s absolutely right. This is one of the latter ones… If you’re not on this train now, you’re just not going to be relevant and you will be sold for three times one-year revenues to a PE firm who will smush you in with something else, never to be seen again.” The contrast with Harvey is stark: Harvey has 2,000 people somewhere building legal AI. Salesforce has 2,000 people building Agent Force. One has 170% NDR and $150M ARR growing like a weed. The other needs to prove monetization in 2026 on a massive enterprise base. The ownership discussion revealed a fundamental tension in portfolio construction. Jason’s rule: “I feel like I can only make money if I own double digits of two winners per fund.” His last three investments: 6-8% despite that rule. His resolution for 2026: “Get my ownership up. We’ll see how I do it.” Rory’s framework on late-stage follow-on: Early-stage funds aim for one deal to return the fund. Late-stage funds play a different game: “We got 4 billion. We’re going to put it to work. The average good deal will be at 3 to 5x. We’ll have a low loss ratio and over time we’ll get our two two and a halfx net. It’s not small numbers of big heads business. It’s a very different business. It’s moving money at scale.” The challenge: When companies are capital-efficient, they don’t need to sell much equity. When they’re capital-inefficient (OpenAI, Anthropic), they need billions, so even $100M buys you only a few points. “Both of those, interestingly enough, would be pretty good deals… Your mental rules of thumb have been smashed to pieces.” Harry’s counter: “You have to turn the next card to see sometimes. And it’s not obviously a $10 billion company on day one. And actually value can accrue in increments over time. And you could miss some great ones by being flippant in being like, oh, it’s not a $10 billion company.” Jason’s response: “If your first check for me is a very large percent of the fund, I don’t have a lot of margin for error. I don’t have the other 145 million that he had in Trip Actions in Navan. For me, that first one has to work.” Jason’s most provocative statement: “I don’t even want to take meetings with mortal founders. I don’t even want to take them, especially if the ask is aggressive.” Context: At $50M post (with everything in), Jason needs a 100x return to make money after dilution. That company needs to be “even better than Navan” to justify the price. “Do I really believe this deal I just did is for sure going to be worth more than Navan? I don’t know. It’s such an insanely high bar.” Rory’s gentle pushback: “I recoil from the ‘I don’t do mortal humans.’ It’s a bit cuz I think, you know, it sounds a little judgy.” Jason’s clarification: “Maybe it was always hard but now like you got to see these 10 billion exits but if they’re not utterly breaking the mold… it’s hard to really believe it’s going to be worth north of 10 billion.” The sobering reality: “You now have to assume that 400 million, 500 million in revenue is the threshold for an IPO. And if you say to yourself that you only want to do deals where you at least have the upside of an IPO, the IPO potential, then the bar to what a doable successful venture-backed deal with upside has gone up.” Rory’s synthesis: “The business has got harder. It has. But also people are getting richer at the same time. The amount of wealth in Silicon Valley is just unprecedented in our lifetimes.” One of the most important exchanges revealed a dirty secret about modern venture boards. Jason: “The better the company is doing, the more everyone’s a grin fucker. There’s just never a critical word said.” His example: “I have a company that’s going batshit and it’s going too batshit… The board members will not intervene in any way to protect the shareholders because of the bad NPS that would come from damaging that founder relationship. That to me is one of the most egregious escapes from fiduciary duty.” Harry agreed: “There is so much fear among VCs of getting out of step with the most successful founders. There’s so much fear.” Rory’s take: “If it were a normal startup with the VCs we work with and they had had to come up with 1.2 trillion, I think everyone would be saying, ‘Sounds good, Sam. Sounds good, Sam. Keep going. Good month.'” The contrast with OpenAI’s actual board: Brett Taylor (likely not a yes-man) and previously Larry Summers (“Larry Summers is many things, but not a yes-man”). Having strong, independent voices matters enormously when the stakes are this high. Jason’s reflection on being told to sell by a founder: “That was a teaching moment for me. I’m like, okay, I crossed the line. Like I didn’t mean I didn’t realize I did.” But Rory’s point stands: “You’re as a board member meant to provide the guardrails. I think when I look at this one, I go, ‘Hm, I hope someone’s providing really good guard rails because if it hits, it’ll hit hard.'” The lesson: Young founders make mistakes, but experienced board members who stay silent are morally (if not legally) more culpable. “Do we really have an audit, Sam Bankman? Do we really know where the money is?” The episode crystallized two viable strategies for software companies navigating the AI transition: Path 1: Go Where Others Aren’t (The Roger Ehrenberg Strategy) As Harry noted: “Let’s go where others aren’t. Get 20% in actually reasonably priced assets. Let’s not do AI dictation tools from YC and get 4%.” This means finding categories with less competition, being willing to take concentrated positions, and having the patience to build ownership over time. The infrastructure layer companies (Twilio, Datadog, MongoDB) benefiting from AI spend without being “AI companies” exemplify this. Path 2: If You’re Slow, Pick Slower Categories Jason’s advice: “Only a couple percent of [Salesforce’s] customer base is fully ready for AI today… If you are a little slow, maybe play to your strengths. If you’re a little slow, maybe maybe go into retail or manufacturing or areas where it hasn’t changed overnight.” The key insight: Individual adoption is explosive (OpenEvidence to 300K doctors in a year). Corporate adoption takes 5 years, not 10, but still takes multiple years. If you’re a smaller team or moving slower, find industries where the decision-making process is naturally slower. But no matter which path you choose, the core message remains: You must be relevant to AI in 2026. Whether that’s replacing humans, automating tasks, or enabling AI workloads, you need a story. Companies without one will get “sold for three times one-year revenues to a PE firm” and disappear. The episode closed with a fascinating debate about prediction markets. Both agreed the space is interesting, but differed on which bet to take. Jason’s lean toward Kalshi: “Based on my limited knowledge, I’m going Kalshi because I feel like it is a safer long-term bet than someone that is riding the current political vibes which are all in favor of everything here.” The risk: “There is a chance there will be a new administration that will be less sympathetic to this category… The first act could be to undo everything everything that Sachs and Buddies have done. That could be the January 1st whatever.” Rory’s prediction: “I predict that any reregulation won’t happen because of any new administration. I think the real challenge to sports betting like this will actually be the leagues themselves wrestling with the fact that when you have sports betting, you have sports cheating.” The Brian Armstrong example: Using specific phrases during an earnings call to tilt the scales on a Kalshi bet creates all sorts of weird incentive problems. “When you have these prediction markets and then the person can tilt, put their finger on the scales of who wins… There’s going to be a lot of weird stuff that happens.” The broader point: Regulatory risk isn’t just about current administration views. It’s about second-order effects (league commissioners dealing with cheating scandals), insider trading concerns (policy bets moving an hour before official announcements), and the fact that “everything is legal” right now doesn’t mean it stays that way. Jason Lemkin: On the exit bar: “The horrible question in venture and startups, it is horrible. Is a $4.5 billion exit good enough today? It’s a horrible thing to say, but if we’re talking about in VC and inside baseball, it’s a bonafide question.” On AI urgency: “You better have gotten a few nickels out of the AI expenditures… If you didn’t, if you’re not growing faster at the end of 2025 than the start as a founder, I give you an F minus. There’s so much money and you don’t have to be Harvey to get a little piece of it.” Rory O’Driscoll: On ownership: “A founder’s optimized fundraising is a VC’s below ownership target. That’s right. If Cursor had needed 40 million to get rolling, then Reedrock would own 20%. If they only need 20 million, then there you are.” On Sam Altman: “There’s a little part of me that’s kind of a bit sorry for Sam Altman because of where he’s put himself. He is the poster child of the AI capex boom, right? And if the AI capex boom unravels and the world and media is looking for a villain to throw rocks at, it ain’t going to be a big search.” Harry Stebbings: On board dynamics: “There is so much fear among VCs of getting out of step with the most successful founders. There’s so much fear. And you guys are going to disagree with me, but I see it all across my portfolio. The better the company is doing, the more everyone’s a grin fucker. There’s just never a critical word said.” On adoption velocity: “OpenEvidence grew to 300,000 doctors in one year, which is one-tenth of the amount of time it took Doximity. That was interesting just in terms of market pull and adoption rate.” Final Thought: The venture landscape going into 2026 is simultaneously the most exciting and most unforgiving it’s ever been. Pricing is high, ownership is compressed, exit expectations are brutal, and the speed of AI adoption creates winners and losers faster than any previous technology shift. But for those who can navigate it—who can find the right companies, get meaningful ownership, help them capture AI spend, and provide real board-level guidance—the wealth creation is unprecedented. Just don’t expect it to be easy, and definitely don’t expect a $5B exit to feel like a win anymore.

WHIO 7 NOW Tesla shareholders awarded CEO Elon Musk a pay package on Thursday that could grant the tech entrepreneur nearly $1 trillion in compensation over the next decade. The pay package would make Musk the best-compensated CEO ever recorded. According to a securities filing in September, Musk would rake in roughly $900 billion over the duration of the agreement. The full compensation would only be delivered if Musk vaults the company from its present value of $1.1 trillion to $8.5 trillion, a figure that exceeds the current combined market values of Meta, Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet, the filing says. The compensation package also includes a set of production goals, including one million Robotaxis in commercial operation and the delivery of one million humanoid robots over the next 10 years, according to the securities filing. Before Tesla released the results of the shareholder vote, some major shareholders said they had voted down the proposal. Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund said Tuesday that it had voted against the pay package, raising concerns about its scale and potential risks. "While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk’s visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk consistent with our views on executive compensation," Norges Bank Investment Management, the manager of the fund, said in a statement. (NEW YORK) -- Musk, considered the world's richest person, currently boasts a net worth of about $504 billion, according to Forbes. If he were to receive the full pay package, Musk would become the world's first-ever trillionaire. The pay package could also increase Musk's ownership stake in Tesla to as much as 29%. Musk has long pursued a larger ownership stake. “We are at a pivotal juncture in Tesla’s history, and the proposals the Special Committee has carefully designed and the Board has put forward will help determine Tesla’s future,” the company’s website said earlier this week. “If you believe, like us, that Elon is the CEO that can make our ambitious vision a reality, vote NOW.” Online voting among shareholders closed at 11:59 a.m. ET on Wednesday. The company's new compensation package arrives as Musk's previous payment plan remains in legal limbo. Last year, a Delaware judge twice struck down a $50 billion pay package for Musk put forward by the company in 2018. Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Court of Chancery, which litigates corporate governance litigation for companies incorporated in Delaware, initially declared that the negotiations surrounding the package had been inappropriate, due to a lack of independence among board members and problematic influence by Musk over those negotiations. In a second ruling, McCormick decided that an additional shareholder vote on the compensation package -- even if made with full knowledge of the initial problems surrounding the negotiation of the agreement -- could not undo those problems. Musk has appealed the ruling. Tesla announced a 12% jump in revenue over the third quarter in October, snapping a streak of two consecutive quarters of falling sales. Still, earnings fell short of analysts’ expectations, causing a drop in the stock price. Overall, shares of Tesla have climbed about 16% this year, putting them roughly in line with a jump in the S&P 500 over that period. Musk's work as a “special government employee” with the Trump administration, which ended in May, set off demonstrations at Tesla dealerships worldwide in protest of his effort to slash government spending as leader of the Department of Government Efficiency. On an earnings call in June, Musk fielded a question about his control of the company, which a Morgan Stanley analyst said was 13%. "As I mentioned before, I think my control of Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction, but not so much control that I can't be thrown out if I go crazy," Musk said in jest.

Musk would become the best-compensated CEO ever. Tesla shareholders awarded CEO Elon Musk a pay package on Thursday that could grant the tech entrepreneur nearly $1 trillion in compensation over the next decade. The pay package would make Musk the best-compensated CEO ever recorded. According to a securities filing in September, Musk would rake in roughly $900 billion over the duration of the agreement. Approval of the compensation package received more than 75% of the shareholder vote, Tesla General Counsel Brandon Erhart said during the shareholder meeting on Thursday. The full compensation would only be delivered if Musk vaults the company from its present value of $1.1 trillion to $8.5 trillion, a figure that exceeds the current combined market values of Meta, Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet, the filing says.

"As I mentioned before, I think my control of Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction, but not so much control that I can't be thrown out if I go crazy," Musk said in jest. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Is the AI boom losing steam as investors grow wary of returns?

Billions have poured into AI, helping stock valuations soar. But the cracks are starting to show. Slowing adoption, surging costs and elusive profits are fueling warnings that the boom may be headed for a hard reset. The artificial intelligence (AI) party is still in full swing, with tens of billions globally pouring into infrastructure, startups and attracting the best talent. Among the headline announcements this year: ChatGPT parent company Open AI, Softbank and Oracle pledged to invest $500 billion (€433 billion) in AI supercomputers, Open AI and chip giant Nvidia announced a $100 billion fund to maintain the United States' dominance in advanced chips, while Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Tencent hiked investments to help speed up China's ambition to lead AI by 2030. Since ChatGPT’s debut in November 2022, AI-related stocks have added an estimated $17.5 trillion in market value, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, driving around 75% of the S&P 500’s gains and propelling companies like Nvidia and Microsoft to record-breaking valuations. But signs of a hangover are getting harder to ignore. AI usage by corporations is slipping, spending is tightening and the machine learning hype has massively outpaced the profits. Many economists think usage concerns, barely three years into AI going mainstream, dropkick the prevailing narrative that AI would revolutionize how businesses operate by streamlining repetitive tasks and improving forecasting. "The vast bet on AI infrastructure assumes surging usage, yet multiple US surveys show adoption has actually declined since the summer," Carl-Benedikt Frey, professor of AI & work at the UK's University of Oxford, told DW. "Unless new, durable use cases emerge quickly, something will give — and the bubble could burst." The US Census Bureau, which surveys 1.2 million US companies every fortnight, found that AI-tool usage at firms with more than 250 employees dropped from nearly 14% in June to under 12% in August. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video AI’s biggest challenge remains its tendency to hallucinate — generating plausible but false information. Other weaknesses are inconsistent reliability and the poor performance of autonomous agents, which complete tasks successfully only about a third of the time. "Unlike an intern who learns on the job, today’s pretrained [AI] systems don’t improve through experience. We need continual learning and models that adapt to changing circumstances," said Frey. As the gap widens between sky-high expectations and commercial reality, investor enthusiasm for AI is starting to fade. In the third quarter of the year, venture-capital deals with private AI firms dropped by 22% quarter on quarter to 1,295, although funding levels remained above $45 billion for the fourth consecutive quarter, market intelligence firm CB Insights wrote last month. "What perturbs me is the scale of the money being invested compared to the amount of revenue flowing from AI," economist Stuart Mills, a senior fellow at the London School of Economics, told DW. Market leader OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft, generated $3.7 billion in revenue last year, versus total operating expenses of $8-9 billion. The company says it is on course to make $13 billion this year but is still expected to burn through $129 billion before 2029, news site The Information calculated in September. Mills thinks generative AI companies like Elon Musk's Grok and ChatGPT are "charging far less than they need to make a profit" and should raise subscription prices. Few have quantified the AI bubble more starkly than Julien Garran, partner at UK-based research firm MacroStrategy Partnership. He argues that the sheer volume of capital flowing into AI — despite little evidence of sustainable returns — dwarfs previous speculative frenzies. "We estimate a misallocation of capital equivalent to 65% of US GDP — four times bigger than the housing buildup before the 2008/9 financial crisis and 17 times bigger than the dot-com bust," Garran told DW. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Recent earnings from Big Tech have sparked cautious optimism, but also fresh doubts about AI’s staying power. Data analytics and intelligence platform Palantir's Q3 revenue surged 63% year-over-year, but its stock price fell by up to 7% on the news. AMD and Meta also saw their strong AI-related earnings overshadowed by market concerns about sustainability. That disconnect between soaring valuations and shaky fundamentals is exactly what worries Mills, who sees a widening gap between what AI promises and what it actually delivers to businesses. "The data suggests that AI is not penetrating high enough up the value chain. Loads of people are using it, but it's not being used for tasks that directly contribute to value production," he told DW. Nvidia's upcoming earnings on November 19 may prove a key test of whether the AI boom still has legs. In the second quarter, Nvidia's data center sales alone made up 88% of total revenue, which hit a record $46.7 billion. For Q3, the company has guided $54 billion, projecting 54% year-on-year growth, which would equate to a full-year total of more than $200 billion. "With the exception of Nvidia, which is selling shovels in a gold rush, most generative AI companies are both wildly overvalued and wildly overhyped," Gary Marcus, Emeritus Professor of Psychology and Neural Science at New York University, told DW. "My guess is that it will all fall apart, possibly soon. The fundamentals, technical and economic, make no sense." Garran, meanwhile, believes the era of rapid progress in large language models (LLMs) is drawing to a close, not because of technical limits, but because the economics no longer stack up. "They [AI platforms] have already hit the wall," Garran said, adding that the cost of training new models is "skyrocketing, and the improvements aren’t much better." Striking a more positive tone, Sarah Hoffman, director of AI Thought Leadership at the New York-based market intelligence firm AlphaSense, predicted a "market correction" in AI, rather than a "cataclysmic 'bubble bursting.'" After an extended period of extraordinary hype, enterprise investment in AI will become far more discerning, Hoffmann told DW in an emailed statement, with the focus "shifting from big promises to clear proof of impact." "More companies will begin formally tracking AI ROI [return on investment] to ensure projects deliver measurable returns," she added. Edited by: Uwe Hessler

Title: Mark Zuckerberg Drops To Sixth-Richest After Meta Stock Slides
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2025/11/06/mark-zuckerberg-drops-to-sixth-richest-after-meta-stock-slides/

ByTy Roush, Forbes Staff. Mark Zuckerberg’s net worth was reduced by nearly $5 billion as Meta shares declined on Thursday, dropping him among the ranks of the world’s wealthiest after Reuters reported Meta projected a chunk of revenue would come from running advertisements for scams. Shares of Meta dropped 2.3% to around $620.75 as of Thursday morning, adding to a roughly 17.5% slide for the stock over the last week, which includes a single-day drop of more than 11% after Meta posted third-quarter earnings. Zuckerberg, who was ranked the world’s third-richest person early last week behind Oracle’s Larry Ellison ($298.8 billion) and Tesla’s Elon Musk ($496.5 billion), respectively, now ranks behind No. 3 Jeff Bezos ($257 billion), No. 4 Larry Page ($235 billion) and No. 5 Sergey Brin ($217.9 billion). Zuckerberg, who holds roughly 13% equity in Meta, had his net worth reduced by $4.6 billion (2.1%) as Meta’s shares dropped. Reuters reported Thursday, citing internal company documents, that Meta projected 10% of overall revenue—estimated at $16 billion—would come from running advertisements for scams and banned goods. Meta spokesperson Andy Stone told Reuters the documents cited by the outlet “present a selective view that distorts Meta’s approach to fraud and scams,” noting the company’s internal estimates were lower and that the 10% estimate included “many” legitimate ads.” Stone declined to give an updated figure to Reuters (Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment to Forbes). Other documents indicated Meta was under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission for running ads for financial scams, Reuters reported. Regulators in the U.K. reported in 2023 that Meta’s products were involved in 54% of all payment-related scam losses that year, more than double all other social platforms combined.

Title: AI fatigue detected: 4 recent developments show the stock market's driving engine is at a crossroads

Every time Joe publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Good morning and welcome to First Trade. The Supreme Court is skeptical about President Trump's tariffs. It's still early innings, but watch this space for what this means about the future of the market. Rundown But first, traders are getting tired. Love Business Insider? Log into Google and make us a preferred source. Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up now Market musings The old saying goes that something happening once is an accident, twice is a coincidence, and three times is a pattern. Given developments in the AI space in recent days, it looks like we have a full-fledged pattern of skepticism. It's created an inflection point of sorts for a trade that seemed unstoppable as recently as last Tuesday, the last time the S&P 500 closed at record highs. Yes, stocks are coming off a strong day, but it feels like something has shifted under the surface. While three makes a pattern, I'll do you one better. Detailed below are four examples of AI exhaustion, in reverse chronological order, dating back one week: 1. Michael Burry comes out of hibernation to short some giants If Burry is emerging from the woodwork, you know something is afoot. The legendary "Big Short" investor dusted off his X account this week to compare the AI boom to the dot-com bubble. He also disclosed short wagers against market darlings Nvidia and Palantir. While Burry has made a series of bearish bets in recent years that haven't come to fruition, he certainly knows his way around an unsustainable bubble, and his views are an important contribution to the broader groundswell. 2. Sky-high valuations suddenly matter When Wall Street CEOs gathered at an investment summit in Hong Kong this week, few expected the high-profile guests to take a two-by-four to bullish stock portfolios. But that's exactly what Morgan Stanley's Ted Pick and Goldman Sachs' David Solomon did. They warned of a 10-20% drawdown in equities, characterizing it as a necessary and normal consolidation. In a different environment, the comments might've passed without incident. But with investors starting to question AI valuations, it confirmed some latent worries. On this same subject… 3. Palantir sells off big after crushing every conceivable earnings metric A record quarter? Meh. An increased profit forecast? Yawn. All anyone seemed to care about after Palantir's third-quarter earnings was how absurd the company's valuation was, with the stock up 174% year to date. The actual results rendered were irrelevant, offering a clear sign of exhaustion, and a desire from investors to regroup and reassess. 4. Meta's AI-spending pledge sends its stock tanking Loyal readers of First Trade will recognize this as a familiar trope that's been mentioned a handful of times already. Well, it really is that big of a deal. You know the story by now: Meta — already spending tens of billions on AI — said it plans to spend even more in 2026. That might've excited investors a few months ago, but this time around the forecast landed with a thud, and the stock tumbled. The message from investors was clear: we want tangible results, not an opaque money pit. Not convinced? Allow me to offer a visual aid that's specific to OpenAI's role in the fervor. The headline takeaway from this chart is how much Oracle's stock has come back down after a 36% single-day spike on Sept. 10, which was driven by giant new AI-cloud deals and the future revenue they could bring. That day, Oracle announced almost half a trillion dollars in new cloud contracts. A big chunk of that was from an OpenAI deal to develop data-center capacity. OpenAI essentially played kingmaker, as it has so much lately. Since then, OpenAI has unveiled a string of other giant AI infrastructure agreements. With doubts creeping in about OpenAI's ability to pay for all this, investors are discounting these deals. Hence the drop in Oracle shares. This recurring section will highlight individuals who have dominated the week in markets. This week's First Trade MVP is Miriam Adelson, the widow of Sheldon Adelson, founder and chairman of the casino company Las Vegas Sands, of which she and her family own a half-stake. This week's entry would be more aptly titled "MVP of the past two weeks," because LVS has been on a 24% tear over that period, since earnings after the closing bell on Oct. 22. That includes a 5% increase this week. LVS beat revenue forecasts, and saw especially strong growth at its Marina Bay Sands resort, which contributed to a 56% year-over-year sales increase for Singapore operations. The move has lifted Adelson's net worth to $39.9 billion, making her (and her family) the 45th-richest person in the world, according to Forbes data. And did I mention that she's the majority owner of the Dallas Mavericks? No word on how she feels about trading Luka Dončić for pennies. Business Insider's Will Edwards highlights investing recommendations pegged to the biggest trends in markets. One of the biggest questions in the market right now is how effective AI will be in raising profit margins. Tech firms are dumping tens of billions of dollars a year into building out infrastructure to support the technology, helping to propel US economic growth and stock-market gains. But will it ever pay off? For one company, the answer is already yes. And its stock is already seeing the benefits in a big way. Shares of CH Robinson (CHRW), a freight logistics firm, are up 49% year-to-date. After the company's third-quarter earnings report last week, the stock jumped about 20% in a single day. The stock is moving so dramatically because the company has begun using generative AI, said Travis Prentice, the founder of the Informed Momentum Company. AI is able to provide price quotes, book appointments, respond to emails, and process orders for the firm, allowing its shipments per person per day to have increased by 40% since 2022. Meanwhile, CH Robinson has reduced its employee base by more than 10%, boosting margins amid a 12% decline in expenses. "Not the most sexy business in the world, but when everyone talks about AI and there's no ROI with AI, this is a massive exception to the rules," Prentice told BI. "It's driving productivity gains of like 40-50%." "That's a story that no one's really talking about — AI is actually improving business operations," he continued. "They're one of the outliers, but I'm sure there's gonna be a lot to follow when they see the gains that they're having." — Will Edwards Joe Ciolli, executive editor and anchor, in Chicago.

Every time Aditi publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Snapchat users will soon be able to use the app as an AI search tool. On Wednesday, the social media platform announced a deal to integrate Perplexity AI into Snap's search engine. Perplexity is paying Snap $400 million in cash and equity over a year. "Perplexity's AI-powered answer engine will let Snapchatters ask questions and get clear, conversational answers drawn from verifiable sources, all within Snapchat," Snap said in the Wednesday press release. The companies plan to roll out the Perplexity search engine in early 2026, per the release. A Perplexity spokesperson told Business Insider that user data from Snapchat would not be used for training its AI. "Our goal is to make AI more personal, social, and fun — woven into the fabric of your friendships, Snaps, and conversations," Snap's CEO, Evan Spiegel, said in the release. On Wednesday, Snap reported third-quarter revenue of $1.51 billion, a 10% increase compared to the same period last year. Its monthly active users increased 7% year-over-year to 943 million. Snap's stock price surged more than 17% in after-hours trading on Wednesday. Shares are down more than 35% this year. The Perplexity-Snapchat tieup follows the lead of other social media platforms, such as Meta and X, that have integrated AI chatbots into their app interfaces. In April 2024, Meta introduced the Meta AI chatbot on its applications, including Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook. The chatbot received mixed reviews from users, some of whom complained about it being activated unnecessarily and hindering the app experience. In December, Elon Musk's X launched the Grok chatbot on its app for all free users, which he called a "politically incorrect" alternative to other chatbots. The Perplexity deal comes as Snap is seeing a change in how its users interact. Spiegel said on Wednesday's earnings call that there has been an "engagement shift from things like friend stories to content posted on Spotlight." Spotlight is Snapchat's public discover page, where users can view short, entertaining videos, similar to TikTok's "For You Page," or Instagram's Reels. The company plans to introduce features like games and conversation starters to reignite connections between users. Jump to

The social media giant’s adjusted EPS missed estimates, while North American ad revenue slowed sharply, erasing its 2025 gains. Despite hitting a record 498 million monthly users, investor focus shifted to declining monetization and margins. Adding pressure, Meta’s $70–72 billion AI spending plan spooked markets over profitability risks. Pinterest closed below $31, its lowest level this year, as ad slowdown fears hit social media stocks broadly.

Title: Bank of America prioritizes bigger AI initiatives, as annual spending on new tech increased by 44% over the past decade

Time Published: 2025-11-05T19:30:06Z
Full Content:
John Kell is a contributing writer for Fortune and author of Fortune’s CIO Intelligence newsletter. Bank of America’s annual spending on new, strategic technology initiatives, which includes investments in artificial intelligence, has increased by 44% over the past decade to reach $4 billion in 2025. The executive that’s steering those investments is Hari Gopalkrishnan, a 14-year veteran who was promoted to serve as the chief technology and information officer in late July. Today at Bank of America’s investor day event, Gopalkrishnan will outline the vision for these strategic tech bets and discuss how they tie into the broader $118 billion in tech investments that the company has made over the past decade. It is the first time leadership has held this event in 15 years and Gopalkrishnan, CEO Brian Moynihan, and other C-suite leaders will face investors as Bank of America’s stock has lagged the five other large U.S. banks for the past five years. “We have steadily increased our spend in technology, now up to $13 billion a year, of which $4 billion goes into strategic growth,” Gopalkrishnan tells Fortune ahead of his one-hour investor day panel discussion with two other Bank of America technologists. “We leverage across the enterprise, so every dollar you spend gets the maximum bang for the buck, as opposed to sort of being siloed by line of business.” That means that when Gopalkrishnan deploys new AI tools and functionality, he will prioritize applications that can scale across all eight lines of business, which includes global capital markets, consumer lending, and retail banking. One example of this in action is Erica, an AI virtual assistant that’s surpassed three billion client interactions since the tool launched in 2018. It now averages more than 58 million interactions per month, facilitating chatbot conversations with clients, proactively altering them on changes to their past spending patterns or flagging when they may have been double-charged by a merchant, and answering banking questions. The tool is currently available on Bank of America’s mobile app, but will expand next year to the desktop. In 2020, Bank of America launched Erica for Employees, an internal version of the tool that more than 90% of the company’s global workforce of 213,000 now uses regularly. Erica has helped reduce the number of calls into the company’s IT service desk by 50%. The banking sector has embraced generative AI capabilities at a faster pace than most sectors, with investments focused on AI-enabled chatbots, virtual assistants that can summarize financial documents, fraud monitoring, and assisting employees as they navigate complex international regulatory changes. Generative, predictive, and other forms of AI collectively are projected to generate as much as $340 billion annually in value creation for the global banking sector, consulting giant McKinsey has estimated. Financial giants, including Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, have also been steadily rolling out new generative AI tools to more employees throughout 2025. At Bank of America, Gopalkrishnan says he’s less incentivized to focus his investments on AI tools that can save a couple minutes on simplistic workplace tasks. “When you look at the end-to-end client journey, they involve like 40-plus processes and thousands of employees,” says Gopalkrishnan. “You start to pick apart that process and reimagine it. That’s when you get ROI.” Bank of America has explored more than 45 different “proof of concept” use cases for generative AI , with 15 of them commercially live today. Some of the priority use cases that Gopalkrishnan is deploying include tools that can summarize or offer search functionality for capital markets and investment banking employees, making it easier to pull real-time market commentary. An in-house built “AskGPS” tool, which was trained on over 3,200 internal documents and presentations, allows employees to ask complex questions on behalf of clients and receive responses within seconds. Bank of America has also invested $1.5 billion into the company’s data capabilities over the past five years, which Gopalkrishnan says was critical to create a foundation that allowed for more AI adoption. Within the technology department, Gopalkrishnan has deployed AI coding assistants that are used by 18,000 developers. There has already been a 20% productivity lift to select parts of the development life cycle that Bank of America has focused its efforts on. Gopalkrishnan says he’s mostly leaning on one unnamed vendor to support AI-enabled code assistance, but is continuing to explore other tools on a smaller scale. His intent is to standardize the application of these AI coding tools over time to as few vendors as possible. More than 130,000 Bank of America employees are currently authorized to use the enterprise productivity tools and by the end of the year, everyone will have access to them. Bank of America has sought to motivate its workforce by offering AI learning programs that begin by teaching the basics of AI, but also more advanced prompt engineering training. “It’s really a combination of training, education, giving them exposure to the tools, and then ongoing commitment to reskill, as the work changes,” says Gopalkrishnan. John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. Tech earnings highlight cracks in AI’s valuation halo. Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon have all spent billions to support their AI initiatives—and all four told investors last week that they will increase spending even more in 2026. Investors have consistently supported the AI boom over the past few years, though that enthusiasm showed some notable cracks in the latest earnings season, as Microsoft and Meta Platforms both saw their stocks fall amid concerns for the lofty levels of spending needed to support their AI ambitions. What’s vexing investors is: AI is generating billions of dollars in revenue and bottom-line efficiencies, but exactly how much, at what pace, and at what price? That investment thesis still needs time to marinate as these tech giants have added debt to support their AI spending. OpenAI strikes a big compute deal with Amazon; projects massive revenue growth. On Monday, OpenAI inked a deal to buy $38 billion worth of compute from Amazon and will immediately start to access Nvidia’s graphics processing units. The partnership is notable as it is one of OpenAI’s first big moves away from Microsoft, who the AI startup had an exclusive cloud agreement with up until this year. Separately, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman indicated more bullish expectations for revenue growth, sharing that annual revenue is “well more” than reports of $13 billion a year. When asked by the Bg2 Pod about revenue estimates exceeding $100 billion a year by 2028 or 2029, Altman responded: “How about ‘27?” Nvidia makes history as the first-ever company worth $5 trillion. Last week, AI chipmaker Nvidia officially became the world’s first company to achieve a market capitalization north of $5 trillion, pulling ahead of tech rivals like Microsoft and Apple, who are each worth close to $4 trillion. The latest stock market gains came after Nvidia’s GTC developer conference, where CEO Jensen Huang disclosed that the company had secured more than $500 billion in orders for its AI chips through the end of next year. Major new deals that have been unveiled the past several days have included partnerships with Eli Lilly, Uber Technologies, and Johnson & Johnson. Bloomberg reports that Nvidia is now larger than six of the 11 sectors in the S&P 500 index and the entire value of equity markets of most countries. Hiring spree: AI companies are seeking more “forward-deployed engineers.” This year, job advertisements have been soaring for a new specialist software developer who can write code, but also is adept at talking to customers. By hiring more forward-deployed engineers, AI hyperscalers like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Cohere would aim to make their AI models more specialized and useful for companies, thus generating bigger contracts and more revenue. The Financial Times reports that job advertisements for these roles have increased more than 800% between January and September of 2025, citing data from the jobs platform Indeed. Firms that prioritize AI governance are also generating stronger returns from their investments. A recent EY survey of 975 C-suite leaders across 21 countries found that while nearly every company had already suffered financial losses from AI-related incidents—with average damages “conservatively” exceeding $4.4 million—the enterprises that had stronger governance measures like real-time monitoring and oversight committees were seeing far fewer damages. And notably, those organizations are also seeing stronger returns from their AI investments: 34% more likely to see improvements in revenue growth and 65% more likely to produce cost savings. “When I look at that data, what it tells me is that those companies are taking AI more seriously,” says Joe Depa, EY’s global chief innovation officer. “That means they’re likely training and talking about how to leverage AI, both ethically, but also from a productivity standpoint.” The survey also found that members of the C-suite may still be struggling to keep up with the rapid pace of change as AI technologies advance. On average, when asked to identify the appropriate controls against five AI-related risks, including hallucinations and bias, only 12% of the C-suite respondents answered correctly. CTOs and CIOs did the best (26% and 24%, respectively), while chief operating officers (6%) and chief marketing officers (3%) were at the bottom of the list.

Title: 4 signs that investors are rethinking the red-hot AI trade

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Investors hit the brakes on the AI trade this week. The market doesn't seem as confident about AI as it once was, evidenced by the sell-off that tore through the sector on Tuesday. Top leaders in the AI sector — including Nvidia, Meta, and Palantir — all tumbled, thanks largely to concerns that tech stocks have gone too far, too fast after years of stellar returns. The hype, in other words, doesn't seem as limitless as it did just a few weeks ago. Here were the warning signs the AI trade got from investors this week: Michael Burry broke a long period of silence to deliver a warning. After a two-year hiatus from social media, the famed "Big Short" investor made a cryptic post on X, where he occasionally issues warnings about the market and the economy to his followers. "Sometimes, we see bubbles," Burry wrote this week. "Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play." Burry's firm, Scion Asset Management, also placed bets against AI titans Palantir and Nvidia in the last quarter, according to a regulatory filing on Monday. "Investors are sitting on huge stock market gains, and some might have taken profits today, especially in AI-related stocks, in response to Burry's filing news," Ed Yardeni, the president of Yardeni Research, wrote in a note. Burry, who was one of the investors to call the housing bust ahead of the 2008 crisis, has a reputation for his persistently bearish takes on markets. In recent years, he's sounded the alarm about a potential stock crash and a recession, battling against consensus forecasts of continued strength and more gains ahead for stocks. Investors have begun paying attention to the elephant in the room: tech stocks have risent to meteoric valuations. That's been a concern in the market for years, but the discussion around whether some firms in the AI space are overvalued seemed to be front and center this week as investors surveyed the market after a breathless three-year rally since the debut of ChatGPT. Here were some of the biggest declines in the tech sector since the closing bell on Friday: Nvidia: -1.08% Palantir: -8.35% AMD: -2.42% Broadcom: -1.85% Meta: -1.89% Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon fanned valuation concerns when he speculated that the market could be heading toward a correction this week. "It's likely there'll be a 10 to 20% drawdown in equity markets sometime in the next 12 to 24 months," he said, speaking at the Financial Leaders' Investment Summit in Hong Kong. "We should also welcome the possibility that there would be drawdowns, 10 to 15% drawdowns that are not driven by some sort of macro cliff effect," Ted Pick, the CEO of Morgan Stanley, also said at the event. The decline in Palantir stock on Tuesday marked a significant moment in the debate over valuations. The firm beat on earnings and revenue in the third quarter, reporting $1.18 billion in revenue for the last three-month period, ahead of the expected $1.09 billion. Despite the upbeat results and confident guidance, the stock tanked 8% after the report, as investors decided that after a blistering rally in 2025, the stock looked too rich. "All of a sudden, we are starting to see some Tech heavyweights fail to live up to investor expectations," David Rosenberg, the president of Rosenberg Research, wrote in a client note. "Even a company like Palantir has seen its share price hammered, even though its results did top expectations — nosebleed valuations got in the way." Meta stock has declined after the tech giant reported earnings and said it would double down on capex spending. Last week, the Facebook parent said it could spend $70 billion to $72 billion this year on AI capex, up from its prior guidance of $66 billion to $72 billion. It also said capex was expected to increase in 2026. Shares of Meta dropped as much as 14% on Thursday in a sign that investors are growing skeptical over the huge amounts of cash being thrown on AI. Its stock has continued to decline, trading 1.2% lower from Friday's close. Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Apple are on track to spend around $349 billion on capex this year, according to Business Insider's latest analysis of company statements. "It's a yellow flag," Peter Berezin, the chief market strategist at BCA Research, told BI of the sell-off in Meta. "If you don't get that best-case scenario, you're going to have pretty significant write-offs. Jump to

The Galaxy XR headset launched just a few weeks ago in the US and South Korea with a $1,800 price tag. Samsung also launched a pair of controllers for its XR headset for an additional $250 or $175. However, shortly after the headset went live, these controllers were sold out due to high demand in the U.S. The good news is that the Korean OEM has been busy restocking the controllers for the past few days. Considering people who've added the item to their wishlist or clicked on the "Notify me" button on Samsung's website are receiving emails stating that the" Galaxy XR controllers are back in stock." The email further stated that "We have good news. An item you asked us to track is back in stock. Act fast, supplies are still limited." Samsung appears to be working on bringing back these popular controllers, but it seems like only select individuals in the U.S. have so far received restock notifications, while Samsung's official website still says these controllers are currently out of stock, with a "It’s not you. It’s us. We can’t make them fast enough." While Samsung has been clear that the Galaxy XR headset's sole purpose isn't just gaming, like the Meta Quest series. However, without these controllers, it would be tough to dive into more immersive VR games or PC-VR content, as these games simply won't work without them. The controllers are supposedly very ergonomic and are equipped with 6 DoF tracking technology and analog sticks, which deliver precise interactions in the 3D space for enhanced experiences. The Galaxy XR headset could be used for other things like mixed-reality experiences, productivity tools, or even entertainment. This is definitely a setback as users won't be able to experience the headset's other core functionality. For now, gaming enthusiasts have to wait it out and make do by operating the Galaxy XR with a mix of hand gestures, eye-tracking, and voice commands powered by Samsung and Google’s collaborative software, as the company plays catch up.

Sign up now Market musings Stock valuations — seen by many as flying too close to the sun — took a hit on Tuesday after a chorus of bank execs spoke up to throw their weight behind that view. Chief among them were Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon. Major indexes ended the day firmly in the red, led lower by the same AI-affiliated tech names largely responsible for recent records. While jarring, this commentary was hardly surprising. The execs were simply pointing out an age-old market truism: sometimes stocks have to go down and reset before continuing their ascent. Instead, the most interesting takeaway came from what Pick said about 2026, namely that there will be more dispersion. In simpler terms, the Morgan Stanley chief is saying investors will eventually start separating the wheat from the chaff. Higher-quality companies with strong balance sheets and superior financials will reign supreme, leaving the have-nots in the dust. A sign of how this could play out in AI happened last week, when Meta's stock price took it on the chin after the company pledged to boost capex spending beyond already-lofty levels in 2026. Compare that to the relatively mild reaction in Microsoft shares, despite them saying basically the same thing. Amazon is still pouring money into AI as well, and its stock was up double digits on earnings. A main reason? Meta is far less diversified than its AI-focused peers. It doesn't have a legacy cash-cow business like software or cloud computing to insulate it from the twists and turns of the AI trade. Simply put, the companies with the most air-tight financial situations outperform when things get chaotic. Look at the dot-com bubble for a more extreme example. Countless companies went belly-up, unable to deliver on the market's valuation hype. But an elite group of high-quality companies stayed the course and emerged from the wreckage: Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Cisco, and Intel, just to name a handful. That's dispersion in action. So how can you play the theme in your own portfolio? Lisa Shalett, CIO of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, recently made some recommendations for quality-seeking investors wary of market bifurcation: Speculative booms are all fun and games until they're suddenly not. Making these shifts can help you proactively play defense against a valuation-driven reckoning. Bitcoin has tumbled from all-time highs reached in early October, falling as much as 20% from its peak to below $100,000 on Tuesday. It was the first time since June that the formerly red-hot crypto fell beneath the six-figure threshold. The drop can be attributed to two main things. First, there was a historic unwinding of bitcoin long positions on Oct. 10 that saw investors liquidate $19 billion across exchanges in less than 24 hours. That was an inflection point of sorts. Second, it's suffered from an overall risk-off move that was also seen in stocks on Tuesday. Bitcoin has traded as a risk asset for months, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's non-committal approach to a December rate cut has spooked investors. This chart puts the valuation worries outlined above in context. As megacap stocks have made up a growing percentage of the S&P 500, their sales have not kept pace. In the name of preparing for increased market dispersion, it might be a good idea for investors to identify which companies have actually seen revenue keep rising alongside their share prices. This is exactly the type of high-quality attribute Morgan Stanley has recommended traders rotate into. Culture confidential Business Insider's Will Edwards spotlights a hot trend dominating Wall Street and the finance industry. If there's one piece of clothing that's become synonymous with the finance industry, it's the vest. Stroll around Manhattan at lunchtime on any given weekday, and you'll see swarms of sleeveless coats in all their glory. Their ubiquity earned a nickname years ago: the Midtown uniform. It's become an internet meme, the first item in a finance bro starter pack, and eyeroll fodder for hipsters who dislike all things basic. So, with the vest way past the peak of its hype cycle, why are they still such a staple on Wall Street? I hit the streets to find out. One common reason I heard is that bankers simply like to flex — not necessarily their visible arms, but where they work — as many firms give out branded vests. "It's an earned status thing. You put in a lot of work to get to equity research for your team, to get to the PM role for a team, to be able to get to that said firm," one analyst told me. "That's why you wear it." There's also an element of fitting in. Wearing a vest is a shorthand signal that you're part of the club. That's why people even wear them in the office, out of the elements, said Jonathan Grossman, who is two years into working at UBS. "They want to look cool," he said. "They want to look part of the act." Those in finance-adjacent industries like commercial real estate have also started wearing vests. Despite its casual nature, a vest lends you a degree of credibility with financial industry clients, said Laz Rabanales, who works at Okada & Company. "I'm not a banker, I'm a commercial real-estate agent, and I kind of want to appeal to that industry," Rabanales said. "When you're dressed as that person, then they'll most likely want to talk with you and work with you." But there's not always a deeper meaning. As one banker succinctly explained: "It's cold out." — Will Edwards Joe Ciolli, executive editor and anchor, in Chicago. Akin Oyedele, deputy editor, in New York.

Title: Don’t Panic, But AI Stocks Are Suddenly Lurching Downward

Time Published: 2025-11-04T21:50:24Z
Full Content:
By Victor Tangermann Published Nov 4, 2025 4:50 PM EST Investors are increasingly becoming concerned that AI companies may be grossly overvalued — and could struggle to justify their enormous hype by successfully ratcheting up profits. So it’s naturally alarming that shares of AI industry stalwarts, including Oracle, Nvidia, AMD, and Amazon, fell sharply on Tuesday, following concerns over enormous valuations that have propped up the entire US economy for months now. AI chipmaker Nvidia’s shares dipped just shy of four percent, while competitor AMD’s slid just under three percent today. Software giant Palantir was hit hardest, dropping over nine percent, despite beating Wall Street expectations with its Q3 earnings. What all of these companies have in common is an enormous price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), CNBC reports, which measures a firm’s share price relative to its earnings per share. It’s often used to determine whether a company is over- or undervalued. In the case of Palantir, the company’s valuation is upwards of 200 times its forward earnings, suggesting investors could be starting to ask difficult questions about the firm’s ability to sufficiently boost its revenues. The sudden dip comes after months of investor euphoria. The S&P 500 index has risen over 20 percent over the last six months alone, only to decline just under two percent over the last five days, indicating growing concerns over AI hype that grew too much, too fast. Companies have been pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into major AI infrastructure buildouts, despite revenues lagging far behind. “We haven’t really seen any major corrections or any real pressure on stocks since April,” Ameriprise chief market strategist Anthony Saglimbene told CNBC. “Profits are good, but I think investors are starting to ask themselves, based on the pace of [capital expenditure] investments from some of these key Big Tech companies, ‘Are you going to see the profit growth over the next year to justify the levels of capex?'” Saglimbene argued that he “would fully expect that you’re going to see a little bit of some periods of pullback.” Goldman Sachs’ David Solomon also raised alarms, predicting a “ten to 20 percent drawdown in equity markets sometime in the next 12 to 24 months.” Just last week, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the firm would increase its already enormous AI spending significantly this year — news that was met with investor skepticism. The company’s shares slid by more than 11 percent on Thursday and are down over 16 percent over the last five days. It’s a precarious moment, with experts warning that the AI boom cycle is propping up a weakening economy. The consequences of a sudden collapse could be enormous. Meanwhile, some are cashing in on the dipping shares. Most notably, investor Michael Burry of “The Big Short” fame disclosed he had placed bets against Palantir and Nvidia this week. Burry famously predicted the US housing market bubble and the following crash in 2008. Whether he’s right about an impending correction remains to be seen. Palantir CEO Alex Karp, for one, is unsurprisingly skeptical of Burry’s bets. “The two companies he’s shorting are the ones making all the money, which is super weird,” he told CNBC today. “The idea that chips and ontology is what you want to short is bats*** crazy.” More on the AI market: Meta Stock Plummets as Investors Horrified at How Much Zuckerberg Is Spending on Misfired AI I’m a senior editor at Futurism, where I edit and write about NASA and the private space sector, as well as topics ranging from SETI and artificial intelligence to tech and medical policy.

ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS(Millions except per share amounts and percentages) (Unaudited) ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(Millions) ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS(Millions) (Unaudited) ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.SELECTED CORPORATE DATA(Millions) (Unaudited) (1) The Company operates as three operating segments, Data Center, Client and Gaming, and Embedded segments.The Data Center segment primarily includes Artificial Intelligence (AI) accelerators, server microprocessors (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), accelerated processing units (APUs), data processing units (DPUs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Smart Network Interface Cards (SmartNICs) and Adaptive System-on-Chip (SoC) products for data centers.The Client and Gaming segment primarily includes CPUs, APUs, and chipsets for desktops and notebooks, and discrete GPUs, semi-custom SoC products and development services.The Embedded segment primarily includes embedded CPUs, GPUs, APUs, FPGAs, System on Modules (SOMs), and Adaptive SoC products. From time to time, the Company may also sell or license portions of its IP portfolio. All Other category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the operating segments, such as amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, employee stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, inventory loss at (recovery from) contract manufacturer and restructuring charges. (2) Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA The Company presents “Adjusted EBITDA” as a supplemental measure of its performance. Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is determined by adjusting GAAP net income for interest expense, other (income) expense, net, income tax provision (benefit), equity income in investee, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, acquisition-related and other costs, inventory loss at (recovery from) contract manufacturer, loss contingency on legal matter, and income from discontinued operations, net of tax. The Company calculates and presents Adjusted EBITDA because management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders in relation to its overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes this measure assists investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to the GAAP operating measure of net income or GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities that can affect cash flows. (3) Reconciliation of GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities of Continuing Operations to Free Cash Flow The Company also presents free cash flow as a supplemental Non-GAAP measure of its performance. Free cash flow is determined by adjusting GAAP net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations for capital expenditures, and free cash flow margin % is free cash flow expressed as a percentage of the Company's net revenue. The Company calculates and communicates free cash flow in the financial earnings press release because management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. The Company’s calculation of free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating activities.

Title: Rise of the AI Job-Killing Machines

Amazon, Paramount Skydance and others have made mass layoffs. Is artificial intelligence the culprit? By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Will AI lead to major job cuts in corporate America? Here’s what OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot says: “The short answer is: AI will almost certainly cause some layoffs, but it’s unlikely to eliminate most jobs outright. Instead, it’s more likely to transform the nature of many roles and reshape the workforce over time.” A nuanced take, perhaps. But there’s evidence that a long-speculated seismic shake-up of the U.S. labor force driven by AI is starting to happen. Related Stories George Clooney Says It Was a 'Mistake' to Have Kamala Harris Replace Joe Biden in the 2024 Presidential Election: 'She Was Given a Very Tough Ask' K-Pop Animated Feature 'Rainmakers,' 'The Nut Job 3' on RedRover's AFM Slate (EXCLUSIVE) Amazon last week announced the elimination of 14,000 corporate jobs, representing about 4% of its total white-collar workforce. A company HR exec cited rapid developments coming in AI, saying “this generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet.” In the next few years, the e-commerce giant forecasts a net reduction in its total corporate headcount “as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a companywide memo in June. Popular on Variety On Oct. 30, Jassy downplayed the AI job-destruction narrative. He told analysts on Amazon’s Q3 earnings call the cuts are “not even really AI-driven. Not right now at least.” What they are about, he said, is “culture,” saying Amazon’s fast growth has produced “more layers” of job functions that can be streamlined. Certainly, Amazon isn’t handing out pink slips because of dire financial stress: It reported total quarterly revenue of $180.2 billion (up 13%) and net income of $21.2 billion (up 38%). Paramount Skydance also initiated layoffs last week, targeting about 2,000 job eliminations (10% of its total workforce) after the closure of Skydance Media’s $8 billion takeover of Paramount Global less than three months ago. In a memo to staff about the cuts, chief David Ellison didn’t specifically mention AI; he said the reductions aimed to phase out “roles that are no longer aligned with our evolving priorities.” But Ellison — son of Oracle multibillionaire Larry Ellison — has routinely espoused taking a tech-forward Silicon Valley approach to managing a major media company, by using big data and automation. Ellison has on multiple occasions said that he wants to “embrace AI.” In a press briefing shortly after he clinched the Paramount pact in July 2024, Ellison said: “We view this time period as being pretty similar to some of the transitions that some of the traditional tech companies went through, such as Microsoft and Oracle, where they disrupted their own businesses to have all-time [stock] highs.” Meanwhile, Google’s YouTube is anticipating AI-induced workforce reductions. AI is “the next frontier” for YouTube and “has the potential to transform every part of the platform,” CEO Neal Mohan wrote in a memo last week to staffers, announcing a major reorg of its product team geared around an AI-centric future. “We need to set ourselves up to make the most of this opportunity,” Mohan said — and as part of the shift to AI, YouTube is introducing a “voluntary exit program” for employees. A spokesperson confirmed that YouTube is offering a buyout option with severance for U.S.-based workers but said no role eliminations or layoffs are part of the reorg. AI superpowers are pumping billions of dollars into building data-processing factories. In reporting Q3 results, Meta, Google, Microsoft and Amazon each raised annual capex guidance to boost AI capacity, and they plan to continue spending heavily. Nvidia, the leading chipmaker for powering AI applications, last week became the first company to hit a $5 trillion market cap. The dramatic impact of AI on employment is undeniable. The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 found that 40% of employers expect to reduce their workforce where AI can automate tasks. “Innovation” related to artificial intelligence could “displace” 6%-7% of the U.S. workforce in the coming years if AI is widely adopted, according to a research report from Goldman Sachs published in August 2025. However, the impact is likely to be “transitory as new job opportunities created by the technology ultimately put people to work in other capacities,” according to the report. Most jobs at risk are entry-level, white-collar roles that can be performed more easily by computers, a World Economic Forum analysis found. The org cited research estimating that AI could replace 53% of the work done by market analysts and 67% of the tasks handled by sales reps. But the robots are coming for many other lines of work. AI was a hot-button issue during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, as the unions feared studios would increasingly use the tech to eliminate jobs for flesh-and-blood humans. The unions ultimately won AI-related concessions from the studios in new contracts, including mandating explicit consent from actors for the use of “digital replicas.” “AI can create a convincing simulation of a human actor, and the tech is improving at an alarming rate,”actor and filmmaker Justine Bateman, an adviser to SAG-AFTRA, told Variety at the time — two years before the hyperrealistic AI “actress” Tilly Norwood ignited an uproar after its U.K. creator said Norwood had secured talent-agency representation. Of course, workers’ fears about machines making them obsolete date to the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. Techno-utopians point out that, historically, advancements have led to the explosion of huge new business sectors and jobs. Just one example: Google, which didn’t exist three decades ago, employed 190,167 people as of the end of September. Some Hollywood leaders, including Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, have pushed the idea that AI is a net positive for creatives. “AI isn’t replacing storytellers — it’s creating tools that empower them to tell stories they never could before,” he said last month on an episode of the “Aspire With Emma Grede” podcast. In the same breath, however, Sarandos wondered whether making a “$300 million or $400 million movie” makes sense if the “monetization model” doesn’t justify the math. Generative AI tools, the exec said, “can do a very similar thing for a more controllable price.” You can forgive workers in the moviemaking trenches for hearing that as code for job cuts.

The sell-off in high-growth tech stocks accelerated late in the session, dragging major indexes lower on fears about valuations touching unsustainable levels. Concerns about equity valuations intensified on Tuesday after Palantir stock tumbled following its third-quarter earnings report, despite solid results and upbeat guidance. The AI software giant beat estimates for the last three-month period, pulling $1.18 billion in revenue, ahead of the expected $1.09 billion. But shares were down as much as 9%. Other leaders in the AI trade sold off in tandem, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 was down nearly 2%. The 10-year Treasury yield was down two basis points to trade around 4.08%. Here's where major indexes stood around 3:00 p.m. ET on Tuesday: S&P 500: 6,771.90, down 1.17% Dow Jones Industrial Average: 47,029.06, down 0.65% (-307.62 points) Nasdaq Composite: 23,379.36, down 1.91% Other big tech stocks selling off on Tuesday include: Doubts are swirling around whether some companies have seen valuations go too far too fast, and whether firms will be able to deliver on their AI ambitions after spending billions on the technology. Palantir's forward price-to-earnings ratio hovered around 240x Tuesday morning. That compares to Nvidia, which has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of around 29. Also weighing on sentiment on Tuesday were comments from top banking executives, who said that the risk of a market correction is rising. Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon both pointed to risks that the market could see a correction of up to 20%. Pick, however, added that he didn't see this as a negative event necessarily. "We should also welcome the possibility that there would be drawdowns, 10 to 15% drawdowns that are not driven by some sort of macro cliff effect," he said at the Global Financial Leaders Investment Summit in Hong Kong. Markets have also been uneasy about the return on investment on AI so far, JPMorgan's Market Intelligence desk wrote in a note on Tuesday. Analyst said that clients have been concerned about narrow market breadth, adding that "there is a global risk off tone." The endless hype around the technology itself might also be starting to wane. "Some are doubting whether AI can possibly live up to the hype in terms of future returns," David Morrison, a senior market analyst at Trade Nation, wrote in a note about Tuesday's sell-off. The AI trade has flashed other warning signs in recent weeks. Shares of Meta and Microsoft tumbled after the firms said they would boost capex spending plans, a sign investors are growing skeptical over the buckets of cash being poured into AI. Meanwhile, "The Big Short" investor Michael Burry recently revealed a bet against Palantir and Nvidia on Monday, adding to the selling pressure in the tech sector. It isn't the first round of volatility for Palantir, which plummeted around 40% from its early-year peak through April amid the broader market selloff. Shares declined another 18% from mid-August through their low in September after the short-seller Andrew Left said he was taking a bet against the company. This all comes at a time when the market is also waking up to the reality that more rate cuts might not be a sure thing. Jerome Powell said exactly that at the Fed's October meeting last week, and the outlook has grown muddled, especially as the government shutdown forces markets to operate in a data blackout. Jump to

Title: The $30 billionÂ bet: Meta’s debt-fueled AI gamble

Meta borrowed $30 billion in debt, signaling that even cash-rich tech giants can no longer fund the astronomical costs of the AI race from revenue alone, marking a pivotal moment for the industry. While Meta's stock price fell due to shareholder anxiety over spending, the bond offering was met with overwhelming demand, indicating debt investors' strong confidence in the company's robust financial health and ability to repay. The primary driver for this debt is the need to fund expensive AI infrastructure, specifically data centers filled with advanced and costly Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) required to train sophisticated AI models. The move highlights a stark divide where established giants like Meta and Oracle can access low-interest debt, while unprofitable AI startups are forced to cede ownership through equity fundraising, giving the titans a major advantage. This debt-fueled spending spree represents a core strategic bet on achieving artificial superintelligence, with its success or failure set to determine the winners in the AI race and reshape the global economy for a generation.

This debt-fueled spending spree represents a core strategic bet on achieving artificial superintelligence, with its success or failure set to determine the winners in the AI race and reshape the global economy for a generation. In a stunning financial maneuver that signals a new phase in the artificial intelligence arms race, Facebook's parent company Meta turned to the debt markets this week, borrowing a staggering $30 billion. The move reveals a fundamental shift for cash-rich tech behemoths, as even the most profitable companies are finding their war chests insufficient to bankroll the astronomical costs of the race for superintelligence. This pivot to massive debt accumulation marks a pivotal moment, raising profound questions about the sustainability of the AI boom. For decades, internet titans have been defined by immense cash flows, able to fund ambitious projects from profits alone. That era may be closing. Meta's decision to issue bonds comes despite the company taking in over $100 billion in annual revenue. The sheer scale of this borrowing indicates that the financial requirements for leading the AI revolution are unprecedented, dwarfing even the most ambitious tech projects of the past. A market of contradictions The debt offering occurred on the same day that Meta's stock price plunged more than 11 percent, a reaction from shareholders spooked by aggressive spending and disappointing earnings. This divergence paints a complex picture: equity investors are growing anxious, while debt investors displayed overwhelming confidence. Demand for Meta's bonds was reportedly four times greater than the supply, a clear signal that the credit market views the social media titan as a safe bet. This confidence is not unfounded. Meta's underlying financial health remains robust. Excluding a one-time charge, the company's net income for the recent quarter was a colossal $18.6 billionâsurpassing the combined profits of General Motors, Netflix, Walmart and Visa. For bond investors, this massive profit engine represents a near-guarantee that their loans will be repaid with interest, regardless of whether Meta's AI bets ultimately pay off. The high cost of the AI arms race Why does a company swimming in cash need to borrow $30 billion? The answer lies in the breathtakingly expensive infrastructure required for advanced AI. The core of this is the data center, massive facilities packed with advanced computer chips called Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). These incredibly powerful and expensive processors are uniquely capable of handling the immense calculations needed to train sophisticated AI models. Acquiring these chips and building the facilities to house them requires capital on a scale rarely seen outside of national defense budgets. Meta is not alone in this debt-fueled pursuit. Oracle raised $18 billion in a bond offering last month and is reportedly preparing to secure an additional $38 billion through bank loans. These moves highlight an industry-wide trend. The AI race is no longer a sprint funded by petty cash; it is a marathon requiring financial endurance that even these giants cannot maintain through revenue alone. A two-tiered financial ecosystem This rush to debt creates a stark divide in the AI landscape. For established tech titans like Meta and Oracle, the debt markets are wide open. Lenders see their immense cash flows and physical assets as solid collateral, making the risk of default seem low. This access to low-interest debt provides a monumental competitive advantage. For pioneering AI startups like OpenAI and Anthropic, the situation is entirely different. These companies, despite their groundbreaking technology, are not yet profitable. The debt market is a hostile territory for them, as lenders would charge exorbitant interest rates to compensate for the risk of failure. Consequently, these younger companies are forced to continue raising money by selling equity stakes, gradually ceding ownership and control to outside financiers. The specter of an AI bubble As billions pour into AI infrastructure, a critical question emerges: is this a sound investment, or are we witnessing the inflation of a historic bubble? The markets, for now, are shrugging off the possibility of a burst. The confidence in Meta's bond offering suggests that institutional investors believe the AI revolution is real and that its leaders will be rewarded. However, the parallel decline in Meta's stock price serves as a cautionary tale. It reflects a growing concern on Wall Street that the returns on this massive AI investment are uncertain and far in the future. CEO Mark Zuckerberg's spending appears to have no limit, and while the company can afford to service its new debt, shareholders are worried that the aggressive pursuit of AI could come at the expense of near-term profitability. "The AI race is astronomically expensive because training and operating advanced AI models requires immense computational power, which consumes a colossal amount of energy," said BrightU.AI's Enoch. "Building and maintaining the data centers and specialized chips for this purpose demands massive capital investment in both hardware and physical infrastructure. Ultimately, the cost is driven by the fundamental, non-negotiable need for vast quantities of electricity, a resource that cannot be manufactured like currency." The ultimate gamble The ultimate conclusion of this high-stakes financial drama remains unwritten. The $30 billion debt offering by Meta is more than a simple corporate loan; it is a bellwether for the entire technology sector. It demonstrates that the pursuit of artificial superintelligence is now the primary strategic objective for the worldâs most powerful companies, an objective so costly that it requires mortgaging future profits for decades to come. The success or failure of this gamble will not only determine the winners and losers in the AI race but will also reshape the global economic landscape for a generation.

Consequently, these younger companies are forced to continue raising money by selling equity stakes, gradually ceding ownership and control to outside financiers. The specter of an AI bubble As billions pour into AI infrastructure, a critical question emerges: is this a sound investment, or are we witnessing the inflation of a historic bubble? The markets, for now, are shrugging off the possibility of a burst. The confidence in Meta's bond offering suggests that institutional investors believe the AI revolution is real and that its leaders will be rewarded. However, the parallel decline in Meta's stock price serves as a cautionary tale. It reflects a growing concern on Wall Street that the returns on this massive AI investment are uncertain and far in the future. CEO Mark Zuckerberg's spending appears to have no limit, and while the company can afford to service its new debt, shareholders are worried that the aggressive pursuit of AI could come at the expense of near-term profitability. "The AI race is astronomically expensive because training and operating advanced AI models requires immense computational power, which consumes a colossal amount of energy," said BrightU.AI's Enoch. "Building and maintaining the data centers and specialized chips for this purpose demands massive capital investment in both hardware and physical infrastructure. Ultimately, the cost is driven by the fundamental, non-negotiable need for vast quantities of electricity, a resource that cannot be manufactured like currency." The ultimate gamble The ultimate conclusion of this high-stakes financial drama remains unwritten. The $30 billion debt offering by Meta is more than a simple corporate loan; it is a bellwether for the entire technology sector. It demonstrates that the pursuit of artificial superintelligence is now the primary strategic objective for the worldâs most powerful companies, an objective so costly that it requires mortgaging future profits for decades to come. The success or failure of this gamble will not only determine the winners and losers in the AI race but will also reshape the global economic landscape for a generation.

Sources include:Â Techexplore.com msn.com barrons.com BrightU.ai Brighteon.com This confidence is not unfounded. Meta's underlying financial health remains robust. Excluding a one-time charge, the company's net income for the recent quarter was a colossal $18.6 billionâsurpassing the combined profits of General Motors, Netflix, Walmart and Visa. For bond investors, this massive profit engine represents a near-guarantee that their loans will be repaid with interest, regardless of whether Meta's AI bets ultimately pay off. The high cost of the AI arms race Why does a company swimming in cash need to borrow $30 billion? The answer lies in the breathtakingly expensive infrastructure required for advanced AI. The core of this is the data center, massive facilities packed with advanced computer chips called Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). These incredibly powerful and expensive processors are uniquely capable of handling the immense calculations needed to train sophisticated AI models. Acquiring these chips and building the facilities to house them requires capital on a scale rarely seen outside of national defense budgets. Meta is not alone in this debt-fueled pursuit. Oracle raised $18 billion in a bond offering last month and is reportedly preparing to secure an additional $38 billion through bank loans. These moves highlight an industry-wide trend. The AI race is no longer a sprint funded by petty cash; it is a marathon requiring financial endurance that even these giants cannot maintain through revenue alone. A two-tiered financial ecosystem This rush to debt creates a stark divide in the AI landscape. For established tech titans like Meta and Oracle, the debt markets are wide open. Lenders see their immense cash flows and physical assets as solid collateral, making the risk of default seem low. This access to low-interest debt provides a monumental competitive advantage.

It reflects a growing concern on Wall Street that the returns on this massive AI investment are uncertain and far in the future. CEO Mark Zuckerberg's spending appears to have no limit, and while the company can afford to service its new debt, shareholders are worried that the aggressive pursuit of AI could come at the expense of near-term profitability. "The AI race is astronomically expensive because training and operating advanced AI models requires immense computational power, which consumes a colossal amount of energy," said BrightU.AI's Enoch. "Building and maintaining the data centers and specialized chips for this purpose demands massive capital investment in both hardware and physical infrastructure. Ultimately, the cost is driven by the fundamental, non-negotiable need for vast quantities of electricity, a resource that cannot be manufactured like currency." The ultimate gamble The ultimate conclusion of this high-stakes financial drama remains unwritten. The $30 billion debt offering by Meta is more than a simple corporate loan; it is a bellwether for the entire technology sector. It demonstrates that the pursuit of artificial superintelligence is now the primary strategic objective for the worldâs most powerful companies, an objective so costly that it requires mortgaging future profits for decades to come.
