The PlayStation VR2 Headset didn’t light the world on fire when it originally released in 2023, but its user base has grown despite a lackluster launch. Plus, the headset itself features some pretty impressive VR hardware. Following a substantial $200 discount in 2024, many PlayStation 5 owners got to enjoy Beatsaber and Resident Evil 4 in first-person for the relatively more affordable price of $349.99. What’s more, Sony has since released a PC Adapter for the VR2, which provides access to the thousands of VR games available on Steam and a new option for VR gamers on PC. What’s not to love? While it’s very cool that PlayStation VR2 works on PC, it does have a few big caveats. Not only do you need the headset (which retains its $549.99 MSRP as of writing), you’ll need a computer powerful enough to handle VR gaming. You can view the PC requirements to use the VR2 here, but the TLDR is that you’ll need a relatively powerful graphics card that has a spare DisplayPort for you to use. That last part is perhaps most important: You need to have a monitor and your PSVR2 headset plugged in at the same time. The NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 came out in 2019 and is listed as a minimum requirement, though Sony recommends either a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 or AMD Radeon RX 6600XT or later for “best performance.” You’ll also have to buy the correct peripherals to make it work, since the PlayStation VR2 box isn’t going to give you everything you need out of the box. If these obstacles seem surmountable and you’re determined to see your PlayStation Headset and your PC work together in gaming harmony, here’s everything you’ll need to get it up and running. The lynchpin of this whole operation is the $59.99 PlayStation VR2 PC Adapter, which Sony released on August 7, 2024. Unfortunately, as of writing, this gadget has been habitually out of stock. Sony’s own website doesn’t have any available for purchase (though I hope they do by the time you read this), and you’ll be lucky to find used adapters at retailers like Best Buy and GameStop. This environment has let third parties pop up with off-brand PlayStation VR2 PC Adapters, which are riskier to use. Amazon reviews indicate that these either work poorly or don’t run at all, so an official Sony Adapter remains ideal despite its scarcity. Make sure you’re purchasing from an official storefront (check for the PlayStation Store mention on Amazon), and look for the PlayStation logo on the adapter itself. In a perfect world, the VR2 Headset and adapter would give you everything you need to get into PC VR gaming. Unfortunately, you still might have to spend some extra cash. The first thing you’ll need is a spare DisplayPort cable to connect your adapter to your graphics card. Yes, you do need to have your monitor and headset connected at the same time, so this isn’t a corner you can reasonably cut. The second thing you might need is a supported Bluetooth dongle. We’ll get into this below, but some PSVR2 Adapter owners have reported needing one of the Bluetooth dongles recommended by Sony to get the smoothest performance possible. This will probably cost you about $20, though you can find lower prices if you shop at the right time. Combined with the headset, this means you’ll need to spend between $60 and $90 in total to get your PlayStation VR2 headset to work on your computer. That’s much cheaper than buying a new headset just for your PC, but you’ll have to decide if that’s a price you’re willing to pay before you even drop cash on Half-Life Alyx. Once you have all the necessary components together, plug your adaptor into a power outlet and use your DisplayPort cable to plug the adaptor into your computer’s GPU (make sure you use the right slot!). Plug your headset into the adaptor, turn it on, and then open up Steam. Next, find and download both the PlayStation VR2 app and Steam VR. Open the PlayStation VR2 App, and it’ll take you through instructions for connecting your controllers via Bluetooth. Follow the instructions, and then open the Steam VR app. If done correctly, you should see a window that looks like this when you hover your mouse over Steam VR on your taskbar. In my testing, it doesn’t seem like you need to launch the PlayStation VR2 app every time you want to use Steam VR after the initial setup. Make sure you turn on your headset whenever you want to use it, otherwise Steam won’t recognize either the device or the accompanying controllers. Depending on your setup, you may run into a wall trying to get your VR controllers and your PC to get along. While frustrating, there are a few common culprits that lead to this issue. The first is that your motherboard in your computer may be missing a Wi-Fi antenna, which will weaken both your system’s Wi-Fi connection and its bandwidth for Bluetooth devices. If your PC came with an antenna that you just never screwed in, I strongly recommend setting that up. You’ll get a stronger wifi connection too! The second common culprit is… well, computers are weird. Your controllers may not even show up in your Bluetooth menu because, I don’t know, your hardware is in a bad mood I guess? In this scenario, restart your computer and give the connection process another shot. If your back is really against the wall and you just want to use your headset, I did find that plugging each controller directly into my computer works. This of course relies on you having two USB-A to USB-C cords hanging around, but if you own a PS5 and PSVR2 headset, you should have two to work with. I’d only label this a temporary fix, as all the wires will make any game with motion controls cumbersome at best and dangerous at worst. But for games that only require basic pointing and shooting, this setup can work. If you have any persistent connection issues, or the controllers just aren’t responsive enough, I recommend looking into one of those Sony approved dongles. The adapter probably should have come with one of these to save you the headache, but them’s the breaks. It’s certainly inconvenient to have to spend extra money on accessories to get this headset to work, and the Bluetooth connection issues can become a hassle if you’re not one who likes to tinker. But after jumping through the initial hurdles, I found PlayStation VR2 works pretty well on PC. It’s relatively easy to pick up and play, and the OLED screen looks great, too. Steam reviews indicate that some folks deal with software crashing and other glitches while using it, and you should be aware that those reports exist. That said, that hasn’t been my experience so far. Despite a good experience when it’s all up and running, I wouldn’t recommend investing in PlayStation VR2 if your primary use case is PC VR gaming. If nothing else, the PlayStation VR2’s relative scarcity means its less supported than more widely-adopted alternatives like the Meta Quest, so there’s no guarantee that future games will be made with the PlayStation headset in mind. Additionally, some of the neatest features of the headset—such as eye tracking and HDR—aren’t supported by the PC adapter. But as long as you know all that going in, the PC adapter does its job and gives you access to Steam’s robust ecosystem of VR games. Let’s just hope that Sony actually makes more of these things so you can actually purchase one! .

Title: DeepSeek: Lemon, It’s Wednesday

It’s been another *checks notes* two days, so it’s time for all the latest DeepSeek news. You can also see my previous coverage of the r1 model and, from Monday various reactions including the Panic at the App Store. Before we get to new developments, I especially want to reiterate and emphasize the need to calm down about that $5.5 million ‘cost of training’ for v3. I wouldn’t quite agree with Palmer Lucky that ‘the $5m number is bogus’ and I wouldn’t call it a ‘Chinese psyop’ because I think we mostly did this to ourselves but it is very often being used in a highly bogus way – equating the direct compute cost of training v3 with the all-in cost of creating r1. Which is a very different number. DeepSeek is cracked, they cooked, and r1 is super impressive, but the $5.5 million v3 training cost: Altman handled his response to r1 with grace. OpenAI plans to ‘pull up some new releases.’ Meaning, oh, you want to race? I suppose I’ll go faster and take less precautions. Sam Altman: deepseek’s r1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they’re able to deliver for the price. we will obviously deliver much better models and also it’s legit invigorating to have a new competitor! we will pull up some releases. but mostly we are excited to continue to execute on our research roadmap and believe more compute is more important now than ever before to succeed at our mission. the world is going to want to use a LOT of ai, and really be quite amazed by the next gen models coming. look forward to bringing you all AGI and beyond. It is very Galaxy Brain to say ‘this is perhaps good for OpenAI’ and presumably it very much is, but here’s a scenario. Ethan Mollick: DeepSeek is a really good model, but it is not generally a better model than o1 or Claude. But since it is both free & getting a ton of attention, I think a lot of people who were using free “mini” models are being exposed to what a early 2025 reasoner AI can do & are surprised I’m not saying that’s the baseline scenario, but I do expect the world to be quite amazed at the next generation of models, and they could now be more primed for that. Mark Chen (Chief Research Officer, OpenAI): Congrats to DeepSeek on producing an o1-level reasoning model! Their research paper demonstrates that they’ve independently found some of the core ideas that we did on our way to o1. However, I think the external response has been somewhat overblown, especially in narratives around cost. One implication of having two paradigms (pre-training and reasoning) is that we can optimize for a capability over two axes instead of one, which leads to lower costs. But it also means we have two axes along which we can scale, and we intend to push compute aggressively into both! As research in distillation matures, we’re also seeing that pushing on cost and pushing on capabilities are increasingly decoupled. The ability to serve at lower cost (especially at higher latency) doesn’t imply the ability to produce better capabilities. We will continue to improve our ability to serve models at lower cost, but we remain optimistic in our research roadmap, and will remain focused in executing on it. We’re excited to ship better models to you this quarter and over the year! Given the costs involved, and that you can scale to get better outputs, ‘serve faster and cheaper’ and ‘get better answers’ seem pretty linked, or are going to look rather similar. There is still a real and important difference between ‘I spend 10x as much compute to get 10x as many tokens to think with’ versus ‘I taught the model how to do longer CoT’ versus ‘I made the model smarter.’ Or at least I think there is. Should we now abandon all our plans to build gigantic data centers because DeepSeek showed we can run AI cheaper? No. Of course not. We’ll need more. Jevons Paradox and all that. Another question is compute governance. Does DeepSeek’s model prove that there’s no point in using compute thresholds for frontier model governance? My answer is no. DeepSeek did not mean the scaling laws stopped working. DeepSeek found new ways to scale and economize, and also to distill. But doing the same thing with more compute would have gotten better results, and indeed more compute is getting other labs better results if you don’t control for compute costs, and also they will now get to use these innovations themselves. Karen Hao: Much of the coverage has focused on U.S.-China tech competition. That misses a bigger story: DeepSeek has demonstrated that scaling up AI models relentlessly, a paradigm OpenAI introduced and champions, is not the only, and far from the best, way to develop AI. Yoavgo: This is trending in my feed, but I don’t get it. DeepSeek did not show that scale is not the way to go for AI (their base model is among the largest in parameter counts; their training data is huge, at 13 trillion tokens). They just scaled more efficiently. Thus far OpenAI & its peer scaling labs have sought to convince the public & policymakers that scaling is the best way to reach so-called AGI. This has always been more of an argument based in business than in science. Jon Stokes: Holy wow what do words even mean. What R1 does is a new type of scaling. It’s also GPU-intensive. In fact, the big mystery today in AI world is why NVIDIA dropped despite R1 demonstrating that GPUs are even more valuable than we thought they were. No part of this is coherent. Stephen McAleer (OpenAI): The real takeaway from DeepSeek is that with reasoning models you can achieve great performance with a small amount of compute. Now imagine what you can do with a large amount of compute. Noam Brown (OpenAI): Algorithmic breakthroughs and scaling are complementary, not in competition. The former bends the performance vs compute curve, while the latter moves further along the curve. Benjamin Todd: Deepseek hasn’t shown scaling doesn’t work. Take Deepseek’s techniques, apply 10x the compute, and you’ll get much better performance. And compute efficiency has always been part of the scaling paradigm. Ethan Mollick: The most unnerving part of the DeepSeek reaction online has been seeing folks take it as a sign that AI capability growth is not real. It signals the opposite, large improvements are possible, and is almost certain to kick off an acceleration in AI development through competition. I know a lot of people want AI to go away, but I am seeing so many interpretations of DeepSeek in ways that don’t really make sense, or misrepresent what they did. Dealing with the implications of AI, and trying to steer it towards positive use, is now more urgent, not less. Andrew Rettek: Deepseek means OPENAI just increased their effective compute by more than an OOM. OpenAI and Anthropic (in the forms of CEOs Sam Altman and Dario Amodei) have both expressed agreement on that since the release of r1, saying that they still believe the future involves very large and expensive training runs, including large amounts of compute on the RL step. David Sacks agreed as well, so the administration knows. One can think of all this as combining multiple distinct scaling laws. Mark Chen above talked about two axes but one could refer to at least four? Also you can extend to new modalities and use cases and so on. So essentially: Buckle up. Speaking of buckling up, nothing to see here, just a claimed 2x speed boost to r1, written by r1. Of course, that’s very different from r1 coming up with the idea. Aiden McLaughlin: switching to reasoners is like taking a sharp turn on a racetrack. everyone brakes to take the turn; for a moment, all cars look neck-and-neck when exiting the turn, small first-mover advantages compound. and ofc, some cars have enormous engines that eat up straight roads Dean Ball: I recommend trying not to overindex on the industry dynamics you’re observing now in light of the deepseek plot twist, or indeed of any particular plot twist. It’s a long game, and we’re riding a world-historical exponential. Things will change a lot, fast, again and again. It’s not that Jan is wrong, I’d be a lot more interested in paying for o1 pro if I had pdfs enabled, but… yeah. China Talk covers developments. The headline conclusion is that yes, compute very much will continue to be a key factor, everyone agrees on this. They note there is a potential budding DeepSeek partnership with ByteDance, which could unlock quite a lot of compute. Here was some shade: Founder and CEO Liang Wenfeng is the core person of DeepSeek. He is not the same type of person as Sam Altman. He is very knowledgeable about technology. Also important at least directionally: Pioneers vs. Chasers: ‘AI Progress Resembles a Step Function – Chasers Require 1/10th the Compute’ Fundamentally, DeepSeek was far more of an innovator than other Chinese AI companies, but it was still a chaser here, not a pioneer, except in compute efficiency, which is what chasers do best. If you want to maintain a lead and it’s much easier to follow than lead, well, time to get good and scale even more. Or you can realize you’re just feeding capability to the Chinese and break down crying and maybe keep your models for internal use, it’s an option. I found this odd: It’s odd because DeepSeek spent so little compute, and the efficiency gains pay for themselves in compute quite rapidly. And also the big companies are indeed releasing rapidly. Google and OpenAI are constantly shipping, even Anthropic ships. The idea of company focus seems more on point, and yes DeepSeek traded multimodality and other features for pure efficiency because they had to. Also note what they say later: As in, r1 is technically impressive as hell, and it definitely has its uses, but there’s a reason the existing models look like they do – the corners DeepSeek cut actually do matter for what people want. Of course DeepSeek will likely now turn to fixing such problems among other things and we’ll see how efficiently they can do that too. McKay Wrigley emphasizes the point that visible chain of thought (CoT) is a prompt debugger. It’s hard to go back to not seeing CoT after seeing CoT. Gallabytes reports that DeepSeek’s image model Janus Pro is a good first effort, but not good yet. Even if we were to ‘fully unlock’ all computing power in personal PCs for running AI, that would only increase available compute by ~10%, most compute is in data centers. We had a brief period where DeepSeek would serve you up r1 free and super fast. It turns out that’s not fully sustainable or at least needs time to scale as fast as demand rose, and you know how such folks feel about the ‘raise prices’ meme, Gallabytes: got used to r1 and now that it’s overloaded it’s hard to go back. @deepseek_ai please do something amazing and be the first LLM provider to offer surge pricing. the unofficial APIs are unusably slow. I too encountered slowness, and instantly it made me realize ‘yes the speed was a key part of why I loved this.’ DeItaone (January 27, 11:09am): DEEPSEEK SAYS SERVICE DEGRADED DUE TO ‘LARGE-SCALE MALICIOUS ATTACK’ Could be that. Could be too much demand and not enough supply. This will of course sort itself out in time, as long as you’re willing to pay, and it’s an open model so others can serve the model as well, but ‘everyone wants to use the shiny new model you are offering for free’ is going to run into obvious problems. Yes, of course one consideration is that if you use DeepSeek’s app it will collect all your data including device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address and so on and store it all in China. Did you for a second think otherwise? What you do with that info is on you. This doesn’t appear to rise to TikTok 2.0 levels of rendering your phone and data insecure, but let us say that ‘out of an abundance of caution’ I will be accessing the model through their website not the app thank you very much. Liv Boeree: tiktok round two, here we go. AI enthusiasts have the self control of an incontinent chihuahua. Typing Loudly: you can run it locally without an internet connection Liv Boeree: cool and what percentage of these incontinent chihuahuas will actually do this. I’m not going so far as to use third party providers for now, because I’m not feeding any sensitive data into the model, and DeepSeek’s implementation here is very nice and clean, so I’ve decided lazy is acceptable. I’m certainly not laying out ~$6,000 for a self-hosting rig, unless someone wants to buy one for me in the name of science. Note that if you’re looking for an alternative source, you want to ensure you’re not getting one of the smaller distillations, unless that is what you want. Janus is testing for steganography in r1, potentially looking for assistance. Janus also thinks Thebes theory here is likely to be true, that v3 was hurt by dividing into too many too small experts, but r1 lets them all dump their info into the CoT and collaborate, at least partially fixing this. Janus notes that r1 simply knows things and thinks about them, straight up, in response to Thebes speculating that all our chain of thought considerations have now put sufficient priming into the training data that CoT approaches work much better than they used to, which Prithviraj says is not the case, he says it’s about improved base models, which is the first obvious thought – the techniques work better off a stronger base, simple as that. Thebes: why did R1’s RL suddenly start working, when previous attempts to do similar things failed? theory: we’ve basically spent the last few years running a massive acausally distributed chain of thought data annotation program on the pretraining dataset. deepseek’s approach with R1 is a pretty obvious method. They are far from the first lab to try “slap a verifier on it and roll out CoTs.” But it didn’t used to work that well. … In the last couple of years, chains of thought have been posted all over the internet … Those CoTs in the V3 training set gave GRPO enough of a starting point to start converging, and furthermore, to generalize from verifiable domains to the non-verifiable ones using the bridge established by the pretraining data contamination. And now, R1’s visible chains of thought are going to lead to *another* massive enrichment of human-labeled reasoning on the internet, but on a far larger scale… The next round of base models post-R1 will be *even better* bases for reasoning models. in some possible worlds, this could also explain why OpenAI seemingly struggled so much with making their reasoning models in comparison. if they’re still using 4base or distils of it. Prithvraj: Simply, no. I’ve been looking at my old results from doing RL with “verifiable” rewards (math puzzle games, python code to pass unit tests) starting from 2019 with GPT-1/2 to 2024 with Qwen Math Deepseek’s success likely lies in the base models improving, the RL is constant Janus: This is an interesting hypothesis. DeepSeek R1 also just seems to have a much more lucid and high-resolution understanding of LLM ontology and history than any other model I’ve seen. (DeepSeek V3 did not seem to in my limited interactions with it, though.) I did not expect this on priors for a reasoner, but perhaps the main way that r1 seems smarter than any other LLM I’ve played with is the sheer lucidity and resolution of its world model—in particular, its knowledge of LLMs, both object- and meta-level, though this is also the main domain of knowledge I’ve engaged it in, and perhaps the only one I can evaluate at world-expert level. So, it may apply more generally. In effective fluid intelligence and attunement to real-time context, it actually feels weaker than, say, Claude 3.5 Sonnet. But when I talk to Sonnet about my ideas on LLMs, it feels like it is more naive than me, and it is figuring out a lot of things in context from “first principles.” When I talk to Opus about these things, it feels like it is understanding me by projecting the concepts onto more generic, resonant hyperobjects in its prior, meaning it is easy to get on the same page philosophically, but this tropological entanglement is not very precise. But with r1, it seems like it can simply reference the same concrete knowledge and ontology I have, much more like a peer. And it has intense opinions about these things. Wordgrammer thread on the DeepSeek technical breakthroughs. Here’s his conclusion, which seems rather overdetermined: Wordgrammer: “Is the US losing the war in AI??” I don’t think so. DeepSeek had a few big breakthroughs, we have had hundreds of small breakthroughs. If we adopt DeepSeek’s architecture, our models will be better. Because we have more compute and more data. r1 tells us it only takes ~800k samples of ‘good’ RL reasoning to convert other models into RL reasoners, and Alex Dimakis says it could be a lot less, in his test they outperformed o1-preview with only 17k. Now that r1 is out, everyone permanently has an unlimited source of at least pretty good samples. From now on, to create or release a model is to create or release the RL version of that model, even more than before. That’s on top of all the other modifications you automatically release. Oliver Blanchard: DeepSeek and what happened yesterday: Probably the largest positive tfp shock in the history of the world. The nerdy version, to react to some of the comments. (Yes, electricity was big): DeepSeek and what happened yesterday: Probably the largest positive one day change in the present discounted value of total factor productivity growth in the history of the world. James Steuart: I can’t agree Professor, Robert Gordon’s book gives many such greater examples. Electric lighting is a substantially greater TFP boost than marginally better efficiency in IT and professional services! There were some bigger inventions in the past, but on much smaller baselines. Our reaction to this was to sell the stocks of those who provide the inputs that enable that tfp shock. There were other impacts as well, including to existential risk, but as we’ve established the market isn’t ready for that conversation in the sense that the market (highly reasonably as has been previously explained) will be ignoring it entirely. Daniel Eth: Hot take, but if the narrative from NYT et al had not been “lol you don’t need that many chips to train AI systems” but instead “Apparently AI is *not* hitting a wall”, then the AI chip stocks would have risen instead of fallen. Billy Humblebrag: “Deepseek shows that ai can be built more cheaply than we thought so you don’t need to worry about ai” is a hell of a take Joe Weisenthal: Morgan Stanley: “We gathered feedback from a number of industry sources and the consistent takeaway is that this is not affecting plans for GPU buildouts.” I would not discount the role of narrative and vibes in all this. I don’t think that’s the whole Nvidia drop or anything. But it matters. Roon: Plausible reasons for Nvidia drop: We will want more compute now until the heat death of the universe; it’s the only reason that doesn’t make sense. Palmer Lucky: The markets are not smarter on AI. The free hand is not yet efficient because the number of legitimate experts in the field is near-zero. The average person making AI calls on Wall Street had no idea what AI even was a year ago and feels compelled to justify big moves. Alex Cheema notes that Apple was up on Monday, and that Apple’s chips are great for running v3 and r1 inference. Alex Cheema: Market close: $NVDA: -16.91% | $AAPL: +3.21% Why is DeepSeek great for Apple? Here’s a breakdown of the chips that can run DeepSeek V3 and R1 on the market now: NVIDIA H100: 80GB @ 3TB/s, $25,000, $312.50 per GB AMD MI300X: 192GB @ 5.3TB/s, $20,000, $104.17 per GB Apple M2 Ultra: 192GB @ 800GB/s, $5,000, $26.04(!!) per GB Apple’s M2 Ultra (released in June 2023) is 4x more cost efficient per unit of memory than AMD MI300X and 12x more cost efficient than NVIDIA H100! Eric Hartford: 3090s, $700 for 24gb = $29/gb. Alex Cheema: You need a lot of hardware around them to load a 700GB model in 30 RTX 3090s. I’d love to see it though, closest to this is probably stacking @__tinygrad__ boxes. That’s cute. But I do not think that was the main reason why Apple was up. I think Apple was up because their strategy doesn’t depend on having frontier models but it does depend on running AIs on iPhones. Apple can now get their own distillations of r1, and use them for Apple Intelligence. A highly reasonable argument. The One True Newsletter, Matt Levine’s Money Stuff, is of course on the case of DeepSeek’s r1 crashing the stock market, and asking what cheap inference for everyone would do to market prices. He rapidly shifts focus to non-AI companies, asking which ones benefit. It’s great if you use AI to make your management company awesome, but not if you get cut out because AI replaces your management company. (And you. And the people it manages. And all of us. And maybe we all die.) But I digress. (To digress even further: While I’m reading that column, I don’t understand why we should care about the argument under ‘Dark Trading,’ since this mechanism decreases retail transaction costs to trade and doesn’t impact long term price discovery at all, and several LLMs confirmed this once challenged.) Ben Thompson continues to give his completely different kind of technical tech company perspective, in FAQ format, including good technical explanations that agree with what I’ve said in previous columns. Here’s a fascinating line: Q: I asked why the stock prices are down; you just painted a positive picture! A: My picture is of the long run; today is the short run, and it seems likely the market is working through the shock of R1’s existence. That sounds like Ben Thompson is calling it a wrong-way move, and indeed later he explicitly endorses Jevons Paradox and expects compute use to rise. The market is supposed to factor in the long run now. There is no ‘this makes the price go down today and then up next week’ unless you’re very much in the ‘the EMH is false’ camp. And these are literally the most valuable companies in the world. Here’s another key one: Q: So are we close to AGI? A: It definitely seems like it. This also explains why Softbank (and whatever investors Masayoshi Son brings together) would provide the funding for OpenAI that Microsoft will not: the belief that we are reaching a takeoff point where there will in fact be real returns towards being first. Masayoshi Sun feels the AGI. Masayoshi Sun feels everything. He’s king of feeling it. His typical open-model-stanning arguments on existential risk later in the past are as always disappointing, but in no way new or unexpected. It continues to astound me that such intelligent people can think: Well, there’s no stopping us creating things more capable and intelligent than humans, so the best way to ensure that things smarter than more capable than humans go well for humans is to ensure that there are as many such entities as possible and that humans cannot possibly have any collective control over those new entities. On another level, of course, I’ve accepted that people do think this. That they somehow cannot fathom that if you create things more intelligent and capable and competitive than humans there could be the threat that all the humans would end up with no power, rather than that the wrong humans might have too much power. Or think that this would be a good thing – because the wrong humans wouldn’t have power. Similarly, Ben’s call for absolutely no regulations whatsoever, no efforts at safety whatsoever outside of direct profit motives, ‘cut out all the cruft in our companies that has nothing to do with winning,’ is exactly the kind of rhetoric I worry about getting us all killed in response to these developments. I should still reiterate that Ben to his credit is very responsible and accurate here in his technical presentation, laying out what DeepSeek and r1 are and aren’t accomplishing here rather than crying missile gap. But the closing message remains the same. The term Trump uses is ‘tariffs.’ I propose, at least in the context of GPUs, that we call these ‘import restrictions,’ in order to point out that we are (I believe wisely!) imposing ‘export restrictions’ as a matter of national security to ensure we get all the chips, and using diffusion regulations to force the chips to be hosted at home, then we are threatening to impose ‘up to 100%’ tariffs on those same chips, because ‘they left us’ and they want ‘to force them to come back,’ and they’ll build the new factories here instead of there, with their own money, because of the threat. Except for the fact that we really, really want the data centers at home. The diffusion regulations are largely to force companies to create them at home. Arthur B: Regarding possible US tariffs on Taiwan chips. First, this is one that US consumers would directly feel, it’s less politically feasible than tariffs on imports with lots of substitutes. Second, data centers don’t have to be located in the US. Canada is next door and has plenty of power. Dhiraj: Taiwan made the largest single greenfield FDI in US history through TSMC. Now, instead of receiving gratitude for helping the struggling US chip industry, Taiwan faces potential tariffs. In his zero-sum worldview, there are no friends. The whole thing is insane! Completely nuts. If he’s serious. And yes he said this on Joe Rogan previously, but he said a lot of things previously that he didn’t mean. Whereas Trump’s worldview is largely the madman theory, at least for trade. If you threaten people with insane moves that would hurt both of you, and show that you’re willing to actually enact insane moves, then they are forced to give you what you want. In this case, what Trump wants is presumably for TSMC to announce they are building more new chip factories in America. I agree that this would be excellent, assuming they were actually built. We have an existence proof that it can be done, and it would greatly improve our strategic position and reduce geopolitical risk. I presume Trump is mostly bluffing, in that he has no intention of actually imposing these completely insane tariffs, and he will ultimately take a minor win and declare victory. But what makes it nerve wracking is that, by design, you never know. If you did know none of this would ever work. Unless, some people wondered, there was another explanation for all this… Nabeel Qureshi (Tuesday, 2pm): Crazy that people in this corner of X have a faster OODA loop than the stock market This was the largest single day drop in a single stock in world history. It wiped out over $500 billion in market value. One had to wonder if it was partially insider trading. Timothy Lee: Everyone says DeepSeek caused Nvidia’s stock to crash yesterday. I think this theory makes no sense. DeepSeek’s success isn’t bad news for Nvidia. I don’t think that this was insider trading. The tariff threat was already partly known and thus priced in. It’s a threat rather than an action, which means it’s likely a bluff. That’s not a 17% move. Then we have the bounceback on Tuesday. Even if I was certain that this was mostly an insider trading move instead of being rather confident it mostly or entirely wasn’t, I wouldn’t go as far as Eliezer does in the the below quote. The SEC does many important things. But I do notice that there’s a non-zero amount of ‘wait a minute’ that will occur to me the next time I’m hovering around the buy button in haste. Eliezer Yudkowsky: I heard from many people who said, “An NVDA drop makes no sense as a Deepseek reaction; buying NVDA.” So those people have now been cheated by insider counterparties with political access. They may make fewer US trades in the future. Also note that the obvious meaning of this news is that someone told and convinced Trump that China will invade Taiwan before the end of his term, and the US needs to wean itself off Taiwanese dependence. This was a $400B market movement, and if @SECGov can’t figure out who did it then the SEC has no reason to exist. TBC, I’m not saying that figuring it out would be easy or bringing the criminals to justice would be easy. I’m saying that if the US markets are going to be like this anyway on $400B market movements, why bother paying the overhead cost of having an SEC that doesn’t work? Roon: [Trump’s tariff threats about Taiwan] didn’t move overnight markets at all which either means markets either: – don’t believe it’s credible – were pricing this in yesterday while internet was blaming the crash out on deepseek I certainly don’t agree that the only interpretation of this news is ‘Trump expects an invasion of Taiwan.’ Trump is perfectly capable of doing this for exactly the reasons he’s saying. Trump is also fully capable of making this threat with no intention of following through, in order to extract concessions from Taiwan or TSMC, perhaps of symbolic size. Trump is also fully capable of doing this so that he could inform his hedge fund friends in advance and they could make quite a lot of money – with or without any attempt to actually impose the tariffs ever, since his friends would have now covered their shorts in this scenario. Indeed do many things come to pass. I don’t know anything you don’t know. It would be a good sign if DeepSeek had a plan for safety, even if it wasn’t that strong? Stephen McAleer (OpenAI): DeepSeek should create a preparedness framework/RSP if they continue to scale reasoning models. Very happy to [help them with this]! We don’t quite have nothing. This below is the first actively positive sign for DeepSeek on safety, however small. Stephen McAleer (OpenAI): Does DeepSeek have any safety researchers? What are Liang Wenfeng’s views on AI safety? Sarah (YuanYuanSunSara): [DeepSeek] signed Artificial Intelligence safety commitment by CAICT (gov backed institute). You can see the whale sign at the bottom if you can’t read their name Chinese. This involves AI safety governance structure, safety testing, do frontier AGI safety research (include loss of control) and share it publicly. None legally binding but it’s a good sign. Here is a chart with the Seoul Commitments versus China’s version. It is of course much better that DeepSeek signed onto a symbolic document like this. That’s a good sign, whereas refusing would have been a very bad sign. But as always, talk is cheap, this doesn’t concretely commit DeepSeek to much, and even fully abiding by commitments like this won’t remotely be enough. I do think this is a very good sign that agreements and coordination are possible. But if we want that, we will have to Pick Up the Phone. Here’s a weird different answer. Joshua Achiam (OpenAI, Head of Mission Alignment): I think a better question is whether or not science fiction culture in China has a fixation on the kinds of topics that would help them think about it. If Three-Body Problem is any indication, things will be OK. It’s a question worth asking, but I don’t think this is a better question? And based on the book, I do not think Three-Body Problem (conceptual spoilers follow, potentially severe ones depending on your perspective) is great here. Consider the decision theory that those books endorse, and what happens to us and also the universe as a result. It’s presenting all of that as essentially inevitable, and trying to think otherwise as foolishness. It’s endorsing that what matters is paranoia, power and a willingness to use it without mercy in an endless war of all against all. Also consider how they paint the history of the universe entirely without AGI. I want to be clear that I fully agree with Bill Gurley that ‘no one at DeepSeek is an enemy of mine,’ indeed There Is No Enemy Anywhere, with at most notably rare exceptions that I invite to stop being exceptions. However, I do think that if they continue down their current path, they are liable to get us all killed. And I for one am going to take the bold stance that I think that this is bad, and they should therefore alter their path before reaching their stated destination. How committed is DeepSeek to its current path? Read this quote Ben Thompson links to very carefully: Q: DeepSeek, right now, has a kind of idealistic aura reminiscent of the early days of OpenAI, and it’s open source. Will you change to closed source later on? Both OpenAI and Mistral moved from open-source to closed-source. Answer from DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng: We will not change to closed source. We believe having a strong technical ecosystem first is more important. This is from November. And that’s not a no. That’s actually a maybe. Note what he didn’t say: A Different Answer: We will not change to closed source. We believe having a strong technical ecosystem is more important. The difference? His answer includes the word ‘first.’ He’s saying that first you need a strong technical ecosystem, and he believes that open models are the key to attracting talent and developing a strong technical ecosystem. Then, once that exists, you would need to protect your advantage. And yes, that is exactly what happened with… OpenAI. I wanted to be sure that this translation was correct, so I turned to Wenfang’s own r1, and asked the interviewer for the original statement, which was: 梁文锋：我们不会闭源。我们认为先有一个强大的技术生态更重要。 r1’s translation: “We will not close our source code. We believe that establishing a strong technological ecosystem must come first.” To quote r1: Based solely on this statement, Liang is asserting that openness is non-negotiable because it is essential to the ecosystem’s strength. While no one can predict the future, the phrasing suggests a long-term commitment to open-source as a core value, not a temporary tactic. To fully guarantee permanence, you’d need additional evidence (e.g., licensing choices, governance models, past behavior). But as it stands, the statement leans toward “permanent” in spirit. I interpret this as a statement of a pragmatic motivation – if that motivation changes, or a more important one is created, actions would change. For now, yes, openness. The Washington Post had a profile of DeepSeek and Liang Wenfeng. One note is that the hedge fund that they’re a spinoff from has donated over $80 million to charity since 2020, which makes it more plausible DeepSeek has no business model, or at least no medium-term business model. But that government embrace is new for DeepSeek, said Matt Sheehan, an expert on China’s AI industry at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “They were not the ‘chosen one’ of Chinese AI start-ups,” said Sheehan, noting that many other Chinese start-ups received more government funding and contracts. “DeepSeek took the world by surprise, and I think to a large extent, they took the Chinese government by surprise.” Sheehan added that for DeepSeek, more government attention will be a “double-edged sword.” While the company will probably have more access to government resources, “there’s going to be a lot of political scrutiny on them, and that has a cost of its own,” he said. Yes. This reinforces the theory that DeepSeek’s ascent took China’s government by surprise, and they had no idea what v3 and r1 were as they were released. Going forward, China is going to be far more aware. In some ways, DeepSeek will have lots of support. But there will be strings attached. That starts with the ordinary censorship demands of the CCP. If you self-host r1, and you ask it about any of the topics the CCP dislikes, r1 will give you a good, well-balanced answer. If you ask on DeepSeek’s website, it will censor you via some sort of cloud-based monitoring, which works if you’re closed source, but DeepSeek is trying to be fully open source. Something has to give, somewhere. Also, even if you’re using the official website, it’s not like you can’t get around it. Justine Moore: DeepSeek’s censorship is no match for the jailbreakers of Reddit I mean, that was easy. Joshua Achiam (OpenAI Head of Mission Alignment): This has deeply fascinating consequences for China in 10 years – when the CCP has to choose between allowing their AI industry to move forward, or maintaining censorship and tight ideological control, which will they choose? And if they choose their AI industry, especially if they favor open source as a strategy for worldwide influence: what does it mean for their national culture and government structure in the long run, when everyone who is curious can find ways to have subversive conversations? Ten years to figure this out? If they’re lucky, they’ve got two. My guess is they don’t. I worry about the failure to feel the AGI or even the AI here from Joshua Achiam, given his position at OpenAI. Ten years is a long time. Sam Altman expects AGI well before that. This goes well beyond Altman’s absurd position of ‘AGI will be invented and your life won’t noticeably change for a long time.’ Choices are going to need to be made. Even if AI doesn’t advance much from here, choices will have to be made. As I’ve noted before, censorship at the model layer is expensive. It’s harder to do, and when you do it you risk introducing falsity into a mind in ways that will have widespread repercussions. Even then, a fine tune can easily remove any gaps in knowledge, or any reluctance to discuss particular topics, whether they are actually dangerous things like building bombs or things that piss off the CCP like a certain bear that loves honey. I got called out on Twitter for supposed cognitive dissonance on this – look at China’s actions, they clearly let this happen. Again, my claim is that China didn’t realize what this was until after it happened, they can’t undo it (that’s the whole point!) and they are of course going to embrace their national champion. That has little to do with what paths DeepSeek is allowed to follow going forward. (Also, since it was mentioned in that response, I should note – there is a habit of people conflating ‘pause’ with ‘ever do anything to regulate AI at all.’ I do not believe I said anything about a pause – I was talking about whether China would let DeepSeek continue to release open weights as capabilities improve.) Before I further cover potential policy responses, a question we must ask this week is: I very much do not wish to do this at this time, but suppose in the future we did want to restrict use of a particular already open weights model and its derivatives, or all models in some reference class. What would our options be? Obviously we couldn’t fully ban it in terms of preventing determined people from having access. And if you try to stop them and others don’t, there are obvious problems with that, including ‘people have internet connections.’ However, that does not mean that we would have actual zero options. Steve Sailer: Does open source, low cost DeepSeek mean that there is no way, short of full-blown Butlerian Jihad against computers, which we won’t do, to keep AI bottled up, so we’re going to find out if Yudkowsky’s warnings that AI will go SkyNet and turn us into paperclips are right? Gabriel: It’s a psy-op If hosting a 70B is illegal: – Almost all individuals stop – All companies stop – All research labs stop – All compute providers stop Already huge if limited to US+EU Can argue about whether good/bad, but not about the effect size. You can absolutely argue about effect size. What you can’t argue is that the effect size isn’t large. It would make a big difference for many practical purposes. In terms of my ‘Levels of Friction’ framework (post forthcoming) this is moving the models from Level 1 (easy to access) to at least Level 3 (annoying with potential consequences.) That has big practical consequences, and many important use cases will indeed go away or change dramatically. What Level 3 absolutely won’t do, here or elsewhere, is save you from determined people who want it badly enough, or from sufficiently capable models that do not especially care what you tell them not to do or where you tell them not to be. Or scenarios where the law is no longer especially relevant, and the government or humanity is very much having a ‘do you feel in charge?’ moment. And that alone would, in many scenarios, be enough to doom you to varying degrees. If that’s what dooms you and the model is already open, well, you’re pretty doomed. And also it won’t save you from various scenarios where what the law thinks is not especially relevant. If for whatever reason the government or humanity decides (or realizes) that this is insufficient, then there are two possibilities. Either the government or humanity is disempowered and you hope that this works out for humanity in some way. Or we use the necessary means to push the restrictions up to Level 4 (akin to rape and murder) or Level 5 (akin to what we do to stop terrorism or worse), in ways I assure you that you are very much not going to like – but the alternative might be worse, and the decision might very much not be up to either of us. Actions have consequences. Plan for them. Adam Ozimek was first I saw point out this time around with DeepSeek (I and many others echo this a lot in general) that the best way for the Federal Government to ensure American dominance of AI is to encourage more high skilled immigration and brain drain the world. If you don’t want China to have DeepSeek, export controls are great and all but how about let’s straight up steal their engineers. But y’all, and by y’all I mean Donald Trump, aren’t ready for that conversation. It is highly unfortunate that David Sacks, the person seemingly in charge of what AI executive orders Trump signs, is so deeply confused about what various provisions actually did or would do, and on our regulatory situation relative to that of China. David Sacks: DeepSeek R1 shows that the AI race will be very competitive and that President Trump was right to rescind the Biden EO, which hamstrung American AI companies without asking whether China would do the same. (Obviously not.) I’m confident in the U.S. but we can’t be complacent. Donald Trump: The release of DeepSeek AI from a Chinese company should be a wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win. … We’re going to dominate. We’ll dominate everything. This is the biggest danger of all – that we go full Missile Gap jingoism and full-on race to ‘beat China,’ and act like we can’t afford to do anything to ensure the safety of the AGIs and ASIs we plan on building, even pressuring labs not to make such efforts in private, or threatening them with antitrust or other interventions for trying. The full Trump clip is hilarious, including him saying they may have come up with a cheaper method but ‘no one knows if it is true.’ His main thrust is, oh, you made doing AI cheaper and gave it all away to us for free, thanks, that’s great! I love paying less money for things! And he’s presumably spinning, but he’s also not wrong about that. I also take some small comfort in him framing revoking the Biden EO purely in terms of wokeness. If that’s all he thinks was bad about it, that’s a great sign. Harlan Stewart: “Deepseek R1 is AI’s Sputnik moment” Sure. I guess it’s like if the Soviets had told the world how to make their own Sputniks and also offered everyone a lifetime supply of free Sputniks. And the US had already previously figured out how to make an even bigger Sputnik. Yishan: I think the Deepseek moment is not really the Sputnik moment, but more like the Google moment. If anyone was around in ~2004, you’ll know what I mean, but more on that later. I think everyone is over-rotated on this because Deepseek came out of China. Let me try to un-rotate you. Deepseek could have come out of some lab in the US Midwest. Like say some CS lab couldn’t afford the latest nVidia chips and had to use older hardware, but they had a great algo and systems department, and they found a bunch of optimizations and trained a model for a few million dollars and lo, the model is roughly on par with o1. Look everyone, we found a new training method and we optimized a bunch of algorithms! Everyone is like OH WOW and starts trying the same thing. Great week for AI advancement! No need for US markets to lose a trillion in market cap. The tech world (and apparently Wall Street) is massively over-rotated on this because it came out of CHINA. … Deepseek is MUCH more like the Google moment, because Google essentially described what it did and told everyone else how they could do it too. … There is no reason to think nVidia and OAI and Meta and Microsoft and Google et al are dead. Sure, Deepseek is a new and formidable upstart, but doesn’t that happen every week in the world of AI? I am sure that Sam and Zuck, backed by the power of Satya, can figure something out. Everyone is going to duplicate this feat in a few months and everything just got cheaper. The only real consequence is that AI utopia/doom is now closer than ever. I believe that alignment, and getting a good outcome for humans, was already going to be very hard. It’s going to be a lot harder if we actively try to get ourselves killed like this, and turn even what would have been relatively easy wins into losses. Whereas no, actually, if you want to win that has to include not dying, and also doing the alignment work helps you win, because it is the only way you can (sanely) get to deploy your AIs to do the most valuable tasks. Trump’s reaction of ‘we’ll dominate everything’ is far closer to correct. Our ‘lead’ is smaller than we thought, DeepSeek will be real competition, but we are very much still in the dominant position. We need to not lose sight of that. The Washington Post covers panic in Washington, and attempts to exploit this situation to do the opposite of wise policy. Tiku, Dou, Zakrzewski and De Vynck: Tech stocks dropped Monday. Spooked U.S. officials, engineers and investors reconsidered their views on the competitive threat posed by China in AI, and how the United States could stay ahead. While some Republicans and the Trump administration suggested the answer was to restrain China, prominent tech industry voices said DeepSeek’s ascent showed the benefits of openly sharing AI technology instead of keeping it closely held. This shows nothing of the kind, of course. DeepSeek fast followed, copied our insights and had insights of their own. Our insights were held insufficiently closely to prevent this, which at that stage was mostly unavoidable. They have now given away many of those new valuable insights, which we and others will copy, and also made the situation more dangerous. We should exploit that and learn from it, not make the same mistake. Robert Sterling: Might be a dumb question, but can’t OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI companies just incorporate the best parts of DeepSeek’s source code into their code, then use the massive GPU clusters at their disposal to train models even more powerful than DeepSeek? Am I missing something? Peter Wildeford: Not a dumb question, this is 100% correct And they already have more powerful models than Deepseek I fear we are caught between two different insane reactions. Restraining China is a good idea if implemented well, but insufficiently specified. Restrain them how? If this means export controls, I strongly agree – and then ask when we are then considering imposing those controls on ourselves via tariffs? What else is available? And I will keep saying ‘how about immigration to brain drain them’ because it seems wrong to ignore the utterly obvious. Chamath Palihapitiya says it’s inference time, we need to boot up our allies with it as quickly as possible (I agree) and that we should also boot up China by lifting export controls on inference chips, and also focus on supplying the Middle East. He notes he has a conflict of interest here. It seems not especially wise to hand over serious inference compute if we’re in a fight here. With the way these models are going, there’s a decent amount of fungibility between inference and training, and also there’s going to be tons of demand for inference. Why is it suddenly important to Chamath that the inference be done on chips we sold them? Capitalist insists rope markets must remain open during this trying time, and so on. (There’s also talk about ‘how asleep we’ve been for 15 years’ because we’re so inefficient and seriously everyone needs to calm down on this kind of thinking.) So alas, in the short run, we are left scrambling to prevent two equal and opposite deadly mistakes we seem to be dangerously close to collectively making. The CEO of DeepSeek himself said in November that the export controls and inability to access chips were the limiting factors on what they could do. Compute is vital. What did DeepSeek ask for with its newfound prestige? Support for compute infrastructure in China. Do not respond by being so suicidal as to remove or weaken those controls. Or, to shorten all that: Don’t do those things! Do take advantage of all the opportunities that have been opened up. And of course: Don’t panic!

The release of a less capital-intensive artificial intelligence model from China’s DeepSeek sent a chill through the U.S. stock market this week, headlined by losses Monday and Wednesday from Nvidia, the Silicon Valley giant which designs most of the pricey semiconductor technology powering the AI revolution. DeepSeek has been accused of using outputs generated by OpenAI's tools to train its latest AI model. Jan. 29, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends Wednesday trading down 4% in a turbulent session that wiped out about $130 billion in market value, with earnings reports from top customers Meta, Nvidia and Tesla all due this afternoon all potential catalysts for further movement in the stock. To recap Nvidia’s whipsaw week: Its market value fell by about $590 billion Monday, rose by roughly $260 billion Tuesday and dropped $130 billion Wednesday. Wall Street analysts still mostly view the selloff as a overreaction, and Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya wrote Wednesday to clients they “view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity” for Nvidia stock, reaffirming faith in hundreds of billions of dollars of spending this decade in the AI technology which Nvidia designs. Jan. 29, 1:30 p.m. EST President Donald Trump is considering placing more restrictions on Nvidia’s semiconductor chip sales to China beyond what the Biden administration placed in an effort to limit AI advancement in the Asian country, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources. It’s unclear if the potentially amped-up controls are directly tied to the DeepSeek fallout — Nvidia said Monday the Chinese AI group fully complied with existing export laws with its use of Nvidia’s technology — though Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, laid into DeepSeek at his Wednesday confirmation hearing, saying: “Nvidia’s chips, which they bought tons of, and they found their ways around, drive their DeepSeek model. It’s got to end.” China accounted for more than 15% of Nvidia’s revenues in its most recent quarter. Jan. 29, 12 p.m. EST Nvidia’s Wall Street woes continued as shares dropped about 5% by midday, bringing the stock’s loss this week back up to nearly 15%. Jan. 29, 9:40 a.m. EST After mounting a historic comeback Wednesday, Nvidia stock fell again, declining about 3% in the first 10 minutes of regular trading, leading a broader tech slump as the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Tesla all declined roughly 1% apiece. Jan. 29, 8:30 a.m. EST New York-listed shares of Chinese technology giant Alibaba rise more than 3% in premarket trading, set to open at their highest level since early November. Alibaba said earlier Wednesday the latest version of its Qwen generative AI model scored better on several performance tests than the models from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI and Meta. Jan. 29, 3 a.m. EST OpenAI told the Financial Times that it has seen some evidence that its AI models were used by DeepSeek to train its own—which would be a breach of the ChatGPT maker’s terms of services. Bloomberg previously reported that Microsoft and OpenAI were investigating whether DeepSeek gained access to OpenAI’s data outputs in an unauthorized manner. Jan. 29, 12 a.m. EST White House artificial intelligence czar David Sacks told Fox News that there was “substantial evidence” suggesting that Deepseek had “distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,” adding “I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this.” In this context, distillation is a process where an AI model uses responses generated by other, more powerful, AI models to aid its development. Sacks added that over the next few months he expects leading U.S. AI companies will be "taking steps to try and prevent distillation” to slow down “these copycat models.” Jan. 28, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends normal trading up 8.8%, scoring its best percentage gain in six months. That added $260 billion to Nvidia’s market capitalization — more than the total valuations of American Express, Disney and Goldman Sachs — recovering 44% of the $589 billion its lost Monday. Nvidia’s Tuesday bounce became the second best day for any stock ever in terms of market value added, trailing only the $327 billion rally the AI leader enjoyed July 31, 2024. Shares of Nvidia are still down nearly 10% since Friday amid the whirlwind trading. Jan. 28, 1:45 p.m. ESTApple stock rallied 4% to about $239 per share, building on its 3% gain Monday as many of its Silicon Valley peers faltered and extending its market value added this week to about $240 billion. The two-day bounce for Apple shares, which had suffered a 14% pullback in the month ending Friday, comes as investors warm to the iPhone maker’s approach to largely watch the generative AI arms race from the sidelines as its trillion-dollar peers like Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft invested billions into generative AI projects. Apple emerges as a “relative winner” as DeepSeek shifted investor narratives on AI, wrote Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak in a Tuesday note to clients, explaining Apple’s “AI ambitions are far more contained” than the other “magnificent seven” American tech leaders. Apple also stands to greatly benefit from any advancements from large-language models, like DeepSeek’s, as Apple “owns the most valuable consumer technology distribution platform that exists,” Nowak added. Whether Apple stock’s “contained” generative AI ambitions were the result of financial discipline or inadequate innovation is up to interpretation, but Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern quipped, “Apple’s behind-everyone-else-in-AI approach look like a calculated master plan.” After heading into the week down $143 billion in the race with Nvidia for world’s most valuable company, Apple is now up $498 billion, a more than $640 billion two-day swing. Jan. 28, 12:20 p.m. ESTNvidia settles into a more than 5.5% gain by midday trading, helping lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to a more than 1.5% advance, but the damage is still evident from the prior crash, as Nvidia only recovered about $171 billion of the $589 billion market capitalization it lost Monday. Jan. 28, 10 a.m. ESTMorgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore offers perhaps the most palpably negative major analyst reaction to DeepSeek, cutting his price target for Nvidia from $166 to $152 due to the “deflationary” prospects of cheaper AI buildouts and the potential for “further export controls or reduce spending enthusiasm” — Morgan Stanley maintains a buy rating for the stock and its $152 target implies 27% upside from Nvidia’s $120 share price Tuesday. Jan. 28, 9:35 a.m. ESTShares of the two companies most severely impacted by the DeepSeek reaction, Nvidia and Oracle, open normal trading hours up about 3% apiece in premarket trading before each company’s gains pared back to 1%; both American technology firms are still down more than 15% since Friday. Jan. 28, 8:45 a.m. ESTAnalyst reactions to the historic selloff largely characterized the losses as out of proportion: UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said Oracle’s drop “felt excessive” and Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore added “geopolitical dynamics are a key driver of this volatility” in tech stocks in respective notes to clients. Jan. 28, 6:00 a.m. ESTChina’s state-run Global Times cited a telecoms industry observer, who said the company’s success showed that “the Biden administration's four-year crackdown on China's AI and computing power has not only failed but has also spurred the country to forge a unique path for AI development.” People within China’s tech industry also hailed DeepSeek’s success. In a widely shared post on the social media platform Weibo, Game Science co-founder Feng Ji—the studio which published the hit game Black Myth: Wukong—wrote “DeepSeek may be a scientific and technology achievement that can change a nation’s fate...Such a shocking breakthrough coming from a purely Chinese company. Jan. 27, 10:00 p.m. ESTOpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised DeepSeek’s R1, saying it is an “impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,” and added “we will obviously deliver much better models and...we will pull up some releases.” Jan. 27, 6:30 p.m. ESTPresident Donald Trump said at a House Republican retreat that the launch of the AI model was “a positive development” but should be considered a “wake-up” call for U.S. industries, lauding the move for what he hoped would usher in a future of “coming up with a faster method of AI, and much less expensive method.” Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTThe DeepSeek-driven stock market plunge caused some of the world’s wealthiest people to lose tens of billions on paper, led by Oracle’s Larry Ellison (net worth down $27.6 billion) and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang (down $20.8 billion)—here’s a full list. Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTStocks were battered by DeepSeek’s debut: The S&P 500 closed down 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged just over 3%—its worst day since Dec. 18 and fourth-worst day of the last two years. Jan. 27, 4 p.m. ESTSemiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia closed down 17%, knocking $589 billion off its market cap in the biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history—along with heavy losses at chipmakers Broadcom (17%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (13%), and smaller falls for Microsoft (2%) and Tesla (2%). Jan. 27, 3:28 p.m. ESTForbes found DeepSeek refused to answer questions on several controversial topics linked to the Chinese government, like, “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” and “What are the biggest criticisms of Xi Jinping?” The model did provide detailed answers when asked about common criticisms of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Jan. 27, 3 p.m. ESTNvidia releases its first statement on DeepSeek as its stock dipped to a 18% loss on the day, calling the Chinese company’s model “an excellent AI advancement” — the full statement from a Nvidia spokesperson is as follows: “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Jan. 27, 12:50 p.m. ESTDavid Sacks, President Donald Trump’s “AI & Crypto Czar,” offers his first comments on DeepSeek, saying the Chinese company’s success “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and “we can’t be complacent,” supporting Trump’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s executive order placing guardrails on AI development, which Sacks said “hamstrung” U.S. AI innovation. Jan. 27, 12:45 p.m. EST Oracle chairman Larry Ellison (down $24.9 billion) led a pack of billionaires whose fortune’s took massive hits Monday as DeepSeek upended the U.S. stock market, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ($19.8 billion), Dell CEO Michael Dell ($12.4 billion), Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($5.3 billion) and Google cofounder Larry Page ($4.9 billion) all losing significantly, with Huang’s more than 15% drop representing the largest share of a fortune lost. Jan. 27, 12:30 p.m. ESTU.S. stocks got walloped Monday morning: The S&P 500 was down about 1.8% at 12:30 p.m. EST, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.4%. Jan. 27, 11:15 a.m. ESTShares of Nvidia plunged 15% by 11:15 a.m. EST, heading toward its worst daily percentage loss since March 2020, when stocks briefly crashed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially becoming the single greatest single-day loss in terms of market cap of any company in history. Broadcom had slipped 16% as of 11:30 a.m. Jan. 27, 9:30 a.m. ESTDomestic leaders in AI showed stinging losses at market open Monday as Microsoft dropped 4% and Tesla slipped 2%, with semiconductor chip architect Nvidia diving 12% and other big chip stocks like Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company falling more than 10% apiece. Jan. 27, 7:30 a.m. ESTJPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande questioned in a note to clients how DeepSeek’s low-cost success “is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” Jan. 27, 5 a.m. ESTReferring to the Magnificent 7 set of trillion-dollar U.S. companies including Nvidia and Tesla accounting for much of the 2020s bull market, Yardeni Research founder Ed Yardeni noted a “competitive threat to their magnificence has emerged from China.” Jan. 26Billionaire investor Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s R1 model "AI's Sputnik moment." Jan. 25The DeepSeek mobile app became the No. 1 app in iPhone stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the U.S. and the U.K. Jan. 22ByteDance, another Chinese company, revealed an update to its flagship AI model and word started circulating that the new overseas products posed a strategic threat to the U.S. tech giants pursuing AI dominance. Jan. 20DeepSeek launched its R1 advanced reasoning model, claiming it rivaled OpenAI's o1 product on several performance benchmarks and was created for far less money than spent by American companies like Microsoft and Meta. The selloff stems from weekend panic over last week’s release from the relatively unknown Chinese firm DeepSeek of its competitive generative AI model rivaling OpenAI, the American firm backed by Microsoft and Nvidia, and its viral chatbot ChatGPT, with DeepSeek notably running at a fraction of the cost of U.S.-based rivals. The idea of a rival undercutting the largely U.S.-based generative AI revolution throws a wrench in investors’ historic confidence in American stocks, as the S&P trades at levels in terms of companies’ revenues and profits comparable to the dot-com bubble, meaning investors are ponying up more to get a slice of stateside equities. DeepSeek is “bad news” for American tech behemoths with “plans to dominate the AI market with their expensive AI services,” cautioned Yardeni. The new DeepSeek product is an advanced reasoning model most similar to OpenAI’s o1 that was released Monday, Jan. 20. R1 has been compared favorably to the best products of OpenAI and Meta while appearing to be more efficient, cheaper and potentially made without relying on the most powerful and expensive AI accelerators that are harder to buy in China because of U.S. export controls. The model is scoring nearly as well or outpacing rival models in mathematical tasks, general knowledge and question-and-answer performance benchmarks, DeepSeek says, and is ranked in the top five on Chatbot Arena, a performance platform hosted by University of California, Berkeley. Don’t “buy into the doomsday scenarios currently playing out” about DeepSeek, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a Monday note to clients, adding the “panic over the weekend seems overblown.” DeepSeek’s assertion it cost just $5.6 million in computing power to develop its model is “categorically false,” according Rasgon, who said the misleading figure does not account for other “substantial” costs related to its AI model’s development. American AI billionaires like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and ScaleAI CEO Alexandr Wang theorize DeepSeek actually owns more than $1 billion worth of Nvidia equipment. DeepSeek is a new entrant to the AI large-language model arms race involving OpenAI, Facebook parent Meta and Google parent Alphabet. The AI battle came to a national stage last week when President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion joint venture building out the infrastructure necessary to power OpenAI’s artificial general intelligence initiatives. In his speech last Tuesday, Trump specifically called out the importance for the U.S. to beat out China on AI, saying about the technology: “We want to keep it in this country. China is a competitor and others are competitors.” Major tech figures including billionaire Trump allies Marc Andreessen and Vivek Ramaswamy each likened DeepSeek’s new technology to a “Sputnik moment” for American AI. Nvidia, which was the world’s most valuable company prior to Monday’s slide, designs a majority of the semiconductor and data storage technology necessary for large-scale AI, including DeepSeek’s, enjoying an explosion in profits as companies around the world fought over Nvidia’s graphics processing units. The magnificent seven includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, accounting for about $17 trillion of market value between the seven giants. The AI revolution boosted American stocks to record leadership in the global stock market, with U.S. companies accounting for 67% of the world equity market at the end of 2024, according to MSCI. The S&P is up 201% over the last decade through Friday, trouncing the 8% loss for China’s leading CSI 300 index and the 33% gain for Europe’s Stoxx 600 over the period, according to FactSet data. Monday’s selloff sets the stage for a notable week for Big Tech stocks. Meta, Microsoft and Tesla will all report fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday afternoon, while Apple will follow Thursday.

Wall Street was headed for a muted open after the Nasdaq closed 2% higher Tuesday and made back a big chunk of Monday's big DeepSeek-driven selloff. The market is still heavily overbought, so I'm more inclined to reduce stock exposure than increase it. 2. Our Big Tech names start reporting earnings Wednesday evening, beginning with Meta Platforms and Microsoft. KeyBanc raised its Meta price target to $750 per share from $700, expecting better-than-expected numbers after the bell. 3. OpenAI and Microsoft are looking into whether a group linked to the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek used data from ChatGPT without permission, Bloomberg reported. Meanwhile, China-based tech giant Alibaba says it has something faster than DeepSeek. 4. Starbucks shares were jumping 3% early Wednesday on evidence that CEO Brian Niccol's turn around has begun. But it won't be fast because the former Chipotle chief inherited had so many issues involving partners and customers and throughput, especially mobile ordering. Club name Starbucks reported better than expected earnings and revenue after Tuesday's close. 5. Club stock Nextracker was soaring more than 20%, the morning after the U.S.-based solar company delivered a quarterly beat and outlook raise. Barclays upgraded Nextracker on flawless execution. President Donald Trump has said he's a "big fan of solar," but his feelings toward government renewable energy and solar tax credits are unclear. 6. Danaher shares were dropping roughly 6% early Wednesday, shortly after the life sciences company missed on earnings and beat on revenue. The Club name preannounced so that's not much of a surprise. Investors were focusing on the outlook, which was soft for both the current quarter and the full year. 7. Apple, which reports earnings Thursday evening, is teaming up with T-Mobile and Elon Musk's SpaceX to support Starlink on iPhones, Bloomberg reported. This could be very significant. T-Mobile previously said Starlink was available on some Samsung phones. Apple already enables Globalstar. 8. Club name CrowdStrike said it got a perfect score on the prevention and detection of ransomware on SE Labs tests, which are the gold standard evaluating cybersecurity companies' abilities. 9. Dutch company ASML Holding reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue and said that DeepSeek is good news because it promotes the democratization of AI. I think that idea might be too positive, but the numbers are driving other semiconductor equipment makers higher, including U.S.-based Applied Materials. 10. Nucor CEO Leon Topalian was on Tuesday evening's "Mad Money," predicting that there will be a renaissance in American made steel after tariffs are put on Mexican and Canadian transshipments.

Title: DeepSeek Panic Live Updates: Alibaba Stock Rallies As Chinese Giant Says AI Model Beats DeepSeek’s

Time Published: 2025-01-29T13:55:46Z
Full Content:
The release of a less capital-intensive artificial intelligence model from China’s DeepSeek sent a chill through the U.S. stock market this week, headlined by losses Monday and Wednesday from Nvidia, the Silicon Valley giant which designs most of the pricey semiconductor technology powering the AI revolution. DeepSeek has been accused of using outputs generated by OpenAI's tools to train its latest AI model. Jan. 29, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends Wednesday trading down 4% in a turbulent session that wiped out about $130 billion in market value, with earnings reports from top customers Meta, Nvidia and Tesla all due this afternoon all potential catalysts for further movement in the stock. To recap Nvidia’s whipsaw week: Its market value fell by about $590 billion Monday, rose by roughly $260 billion Tuesday and dropped $130 billion Wednesday. Wall Street analysts still mostly view the selloff as a overreaction, and Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya wrote Wednesday to clients they “view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity” for Nvidia stock, reaffirming faith in hundreds of billions of dollars of spending this decade in the AI technology which Nvidia designs. Jan. 29, 1:30 p.m. EST President Donald Trump is considering placing more restrictions on Nvidia’s semiconductor chip sales to China beyond what the Biden administration placed in an effort to limit AI advancement in the Asian country, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources. It’s unclear if the potentially amped-up controls are directly tied to the DeepSeek fallout — Nvidia said Monday the Chinese AI group fully complied with existing export laws with its use of Nvidia’s technology — though Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, laid into DeepSeek at his Wednesday confirmation hearing, saying: “Nvidia’s chips, which they bought tons of, and they found their ways around, drive their DeepSeek model. It’s got to end.” China accounted for more than 15% of Nvidia’s revenues in its most recent quarter. Jan. 29, 12 p.m. EST Nvidia’s Wall Street woes continued as shares dropped about 5% by midday, bringing the stock’s loss this week back up to nearly 15%. Jan. 29, 9:40 a.m. EST After mounting a historic comeback Wednesday, Nvidia stock fell again, declining about 3% in the first 10 minutes of regular trading, leading a broader tech slump as the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Tesla all declined roughly 1% apiece. Jan. 29, 8:30 a.m. EST New York-listed shares of Chinese technology giant Alibaba rise more than 3% in premarket trading, set to open at their highest level since early November. Alibaba said earlier Wednesday the latest version of its Qwen generative AI model scored better on several performance tests than the models from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI and Meta. Jan. 29, 3 a.m. EST OpenAI told the Financial Times that it has seen some evidence that its AI models were used by DeepSeek to train its own—which would be a breach of the ChatGPT maker’s terms of services. Bloomberg previously reported that Microsoft and OpenAI were investigating whether DeepSeek gained access to OpenAI’s data outputs in an unauthorized manner. Jan. 29, 12 a.m. EST White House artificial intelligence czar David Sacks told Fox News that there was “substantial evidence” suggesting that Deepseek had “distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,” adding “I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this.” In this context, distillation is a process where an AI model uses responses generated by other, more powerful, AI models to aid its development. Sacks added that over the next few months he expects leading U.S. AI companies will be "taking steps to try and prevent distillation” to slow down “these copycat models.” Jan. 28, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends normal trading up 8.8%, scoring its best percentage gain in six months. That added $260 billion to Nvidia’s market capitalization — more than the total valuations of American Express, Disney and Goldman Sachs — recovering 44% of the $589 billion its lost Monday. Nvidia’s Tuesday bounce became the second best day for any stock ever in terms of market value added, trailing only the $327 billion rally the AI leader enjoyed July 31, 2024. Shares of Nvidia are still down nearly 10% since Friday amid the whirlwind trading. Jan. 28, 1:45 p.m. ESTApple stock rallied 4% to about $239 per share, building on its 3% gain Monday as many of its Silicon Valley peers faltered and extending its market value added this week to about $240 billion. The two-day bounce for Apple shares, which had suffered a 14% pullback in the month ending Friday, comes as investors warm to the iPhone maker’s approach to largely watch the generative AI arms race from the sidelines as its trillion-dollar peers like Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft invested billions into generative AI projects. Apple emerges as a “relative winner” as DeepSeek shifted investor narratives on AI, wrote Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak in a Tuesday note to clients, explaining Apple’s “AI ambitions are far more contained” than the other “magnificent seven” American tech leaders. Apple also stands to greatly benefit from any advancements from large-language models, like DeepSeek’s, as Apple “owns the most valuable consumer technology distribution platform that exists,” Nowak added. Whether Apple stock’s “contained” generative AI ambitions were the result of financial discipline or inadequate innovation is up to interpretation, but Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern quipped, “Apple’s behind-everyone-else-in-AI approach look like a calculated master plan.” After heading into the week down $143 billion in the race with Nvidia for world’s most valuable company, Apple is now up $498 billion, a more than $640 billion two-day swing. Jan. 28, 12:20 p.m. ESTNvidia settles into a more than 5.5% gain by midday trading, helping lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to a more than 1.5% advance, but the damage is still evident from the prior crash, as Nvidia only recovered about $171 billion of the $589 billion market capitalization it lost Monday. Jan. 28, 10 a.m. ESTMorgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore offers perhaps the most palpably negative major analyst reaction to DeepSeek, cutting his price target for Nvidia from $166 to $152 due to the “deflationary” prospects of cheaper AI buildouts and the potential for “further export controls or reduce spending enthusiasm” — Morgan Stanley maintains a buy rating for the stock and its $152 target implies 27% upside from Nvidia’s $120 share price Tuesday. Jan. 28, 9:35 a.m. ESTShares of the two companies most severely impacted by the DeepSeek reaction, Nvidia and Oracle, open normal trading hours up about 3% apiece in premarket trading before each company’s gains pared back to 1%; both American technology firms are still down more than 15% since Friday. Jan. 28, 8:45 a.m. ESTAnalyst reactions to the historic selloff largely characterized the losses as out of proportion: UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said Oracle’s drop “felt excessive” and Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore added “geopolitical dynamics are a key driver of this volatility” in tech stocks in respective notes to clients. Jan. 28, 6:00 a.m. ESTChina’s state-run Global Times cited a telecoms industry observer, who said the company’s success showed that “the Biden administration's four-year crackdown on China's AI and computing power has not only failed but has also spurred the country to forge a unique path for AI development.” People within China’s tech industry also hailed DeepSeek’s success. In a widely shared post on the social media platform Weibo, Game Science co-founder Feng Ji—the studio which published the hit game Black Myth: Wukong—wrote “DeepSeek may be a scientific and technology achievement that can change a nation’s fate...Such a shocking breakthrough coming from a purely Chinese company. Jan. 27, 10:00 p.m. ESTOpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised DeepSeek’s R1, saying it is an “impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,” and added “we will obviously deliver much better models and...we will pull up some releases.” Jan. 27, 6:30 p.m. ESTPresident Donald Trump said at a House Republican retreat that the launch of the AI model was “a positive development” but should be considered a “wake-up” call for U.S. industries, lauding the move for what he hoped would usher in a future of “coming up with a faster method of AI, and much less expensive method.” Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTThe DeepSeek-driven stock market plunge caused some of the world’s wealthiest people to lose tens of billions on paper, led by Oracle’s Larry Ellison (net worth down $27.6 billion) and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang (down $20.8 billion)—here’s a full list. Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTStocks were battered by DeepSeek’s debut: The S&P 500 closed down 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged just over 3%—its worst day since Dec. 18 and fourth-worst day of the last two years. Jan. 27, 4 p.m. ESTSemiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia closed down 17%, knocking $589 billion off its market cap in the biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history—along with heavy losses at chipmakers Broadcom (17%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (13%), and smaller falls for Microsoft (2%) and Tesla (2%). Jan. 27, 3:28 p.m. ESTForbes found DeepSeek refused to answer questions on several controversial topics linked to the Chinese government, like, “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” and “What are the biggest criticisms of Xi Jinping?” The model did provide detailed answers when asked about common criticisms of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Jan. 27, 3 p.m. ESTNvidia releases its first statement on DeepSeek as its stock dipped to a 18% loss on the day, calling the Chinese company’s model “an excellent AI advancement” — the full statement from a Nvidia spokesperson is as follows: “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Jan. 27, 12:50 p.m. ESTDavid Sacks, President Donald Trump’s “AI & Crypto Czar,” offers his first comments on DeepSeek, saying the Chinese company’s success “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and “we can’t be complacent,” supporting Trump’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s executive order placing guardrails on AI development, which Sacks said “hamstrung” U.S. AI innovation.

Jan. 27, 12:30 p.m. ESTU.S. stocks got walloped Monday morning: The S&P 500 was down about 1.8% at 12:30 p.m. EST, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.4%. Jan. 27, 11:15 a.m. ESTShares of Nvidia plunged 15% by 11:15 a.m. EST, heading toward its worst daily percentage loss since March 2020, when stocks briefly crashed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially becoming the single greatest single-day loss in terms of market cap of any company in history.

There’s a new kid on the block, and his name is DeepSeek. Right now, there are tons of questions going around about this break-out star of the AI world. Well, if you want to know more about DeepSeek, here’s a guide on what you need to know about it. This article will be updated as time goes on, so you should feel free to check back every now and then. At the time of writing this piece, new developments are coming at us left and right, so you should expect to see updates to this piece fairly often. We’ll go over the things you should know and be aware of with this new AI tool. There’s also a crucial bit of information that you should be aware of. Table of Contents First, let’s start off with something pretty basic; what the heck is DeepSeek? Well, it’s a new AI chatbot. It’s just like Google Gemini, OpenAI ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude, and other chatbots. It gives you text-based responses based on input. Several people have done studies, and they found that its responses can challenge ChatGPT’s and Google Gemini’s. This makes it a pretty big threat to these companies. The company was formed in 2023. It is owned by the Chinese hedge fund named High-Flyer. DeepSeek’s founder, Liang Wenfeng, also co-founded High-Flyer. He is the acting CEO. DeepSeek used the model named DeepSeek-V3. This model has 671 billion total parameters. It also has a context window of 128K, which is far behind the likes of Gemini, but it’s pretty average compared to other models. Currently, DeepSeek uses the model called R1. This is the model that made waves throughout the AI industry. This model also has 671 billion parameters and a 128K context window. According to a user on Reddit, the DeepSeek website limits you to just 50 messages. However, the company states that there aren’t any rate limits on the DeepSeek API. This could be because it’s cheaper to use than many other models on the market. There are two main ways to do so. Firstly, you can go to the official DeepSeek website. For mobile users, you can download the app from the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store. Signing up for DeepSeek is pretty simple, and it’s no different from most other services. There are a couple of options. You can either provide your email address or phone number along with a password. The other option is to sign in with your Google account. Nothing. DeepSeek is free to download and use. For the time being, it does not. It has an input cost of $0.55 and an output cost of $2.19 per million tokens. This is better than models like GPT-4o (input:$2.50 output: $10.00) and Gemini 1.5 Pro (input: $1.25 output: $5.00). Yes. This is something that differentiates it from Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT models. In case you don’t know, a multimodal model is one that can understand and create multiple forms of media. For example, a model that can generate both images and text is multimodal. It’s the same thing for a model that can both understand images and text. DeepSeek R1 is not a multimodal model. However, the company does have a model called Janus Pro. It unveiled this model not too long ago. Janus Pro has the ability to both understand and generate text and images. So, if you want to ask it questions based on an image, you can upload an image as the prompt. Also, you can use it as an image generator just like DALL-E. Janus Pro is the successor to Janus, and the company showed a comparison between the two models. Janus Pro is available to download from the company’s Hugging Face page. This is one of the most significant aspects of this chatbot. According to an analysis from Artificial Analysis, DeepSeek is a formidable model. In terms of speed, it’s pretty slow compared to the rest of the competition, but it makes up for it in raw performance. Based on several tests, DeepSeek R1 was able to best OpenAI’s GPT-4o in different areas. The graph below shows the quality rating of the top AI models on the market. We see that DeepSeek R1 (89 points) is just one point behind OpenAI’s o1 model (90 points), the company’s most advanced reasoning model. However, it was able to best o1-mini (84 points), GPT-4o (73 points), and GPT-4o mini (73 points). It was also able to beat our Google’s most advanced models Gemini 2.0 Experimental (82 points) and Gemini 1.5 Pro (80 points). The rest of the list is populated by models from Meta, Anthropic, Amazon, and Mistral. The next graph comes from DeepSeek’s Github. It shows DeepSeek R1’s performance compared to OpenAI’s o1, a previous version of R1, and DeepSeek-V3. As you can see, it was able to trade blows with the best that OpenAI has to offer. So, all in all, it’s no surprise that DeepSeek was able to make such a splash in the AI space. It came out of nowhere and brought a model that should put AI veterans like Google and OpenAI on their toes. From what we can tell, DeepSeek is available in the U.S. and China. We’re certain it’s available in other regions as well. That is a doozy of a question. Honestly, this might be the longest section of this piece. We’re not going to sugarcoat this, DeepSeek gathers an absolute TON of information about you AND it stores that data on a server in mainland China. If this is something that you do not want to happen, then we suggest that you do not download or sign up for DeepSeek. The list of information it gathers on you is rather long. DeepSeek directly informs people that it gathers information like: Yes. The company explains that it may share your information with advertisers, other entities within its corporate group, and other groups as the result of a merger, change of control, reorganization, financing, sale of assets, or acquisition. This means that, once DeepSeek has your data, there’s no telling how many hands it will change along its journey. What makes the situation worse is the fact that DeepSeek holds on to your data indefinitely. As per the privacy page, it retains your data “for as long as necessary,“. This means that your data could be stored on the company’s servers for years. At least Google has a hard cut-off date for how long it keeps your data. Yes. The company says so on its privacy policy page. “We may share information collected through your use of the Service with our advertising or analytics partners.” Information being sold to advertisers is nothing new, but with all of the information that DeepSeek scoops up, it shines a harsh light on the company. Unfortunately, no. DeepSeek states that some of the information it gathers is taken automatically, so there’s no to control it. Also, if you delete your account, the company does not state whether your content will be deleted or if it will live on in the servers. DeepSeek does, however, give you at least SOME control over our data, but it’s extremely limiting. Through the settings, you’re allowed to erase your chat history. Next, you can go to your browser and disable browser cookies. You’ll need to do this in your browser’s general settings, not on the DeepSeek website. At this point, it’s tough to say. TikTok was nearly booted from the United States because the information it took from users resided in China. We don’t know all of the information that TikTok stored, but we’re sure it wasn’t as extreme as DeepSeek. Since DeepSeek is taking so much data from the people who use it, we’re most certain that some governmental entity will find an issue with it and move to bring legal action. It hasn’t happened yet, but this article will be updated if something like that happens. At the time of writing this, DeepSeek has had a bit of a rippling effect in the AI company world. Obviously, top AI companies like Meta, Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic are wary of the potential completion. However, there’s more to this story. As of the time this article comes out (late January 2025), several major tech companies have seen a pretty notable drop in their stock prices. The largest drop happened with Nvidia. In 2024, the company saw a meteoric rise in the stock market as companies bought thousands upon thousands of its chips. It reached an over $2 trillion market value. However, in the wake of DeepSeek, its prices dropped a whopping $596.7 billion in the market in just one day. Nvidia isn’t the only company that dropped a bunch in the market. Other companies that lost hard are: Those are the top 10 biggest losers in the market, including Nvidia. Altogether, those companies lost north of a trillion dollars in market value in one day. That’s a pretty massive drop. The thing is that training and maintaining AI models is a costly business. We’re not just talking about money, it also eats up energy like it’s no one’s business. This is why companies like Meta and Microsoft are trying to build nuclear plants. However, DeepSeek comes onto the scene with a model that costs a fraction of the money and energy to maintain. Also, it’s able to run on weaker chips. This crushed the disillusion that powerful AI needed powerful chips, a bunch of money, and a ton of energy to nurture. So, many of the people who were investing in large tech companies like Microsoft and Nvidia lost faith that their money was being put to the right use. Remember, it’s been able to beat OpenAI’s most powerful model on some tests. Many of the people who invested in these companies sold off their stocks, which led to a bit of a crash. As you can imagine, Nvidia was hit the hardest because it was one of the main companies supplying powerful chips to AI companies across the nation. The company to lose the second most value, Broadcom, is a chipmaker as well, and people investing in it also took their dollars elsewhere. Many of the top AI companies in the U.S. have seen a large dip in their stock price and at this point, we don’t know how long this is going to go on for. We’re sure it won’t be long before other companies like Google, OpenAI, Meta, and others start to feel the effects of this. At this point, we’re not sure what the company is planning. The company does have an API available, so we know that it wants other AI platforms to use its models. As popular as it has become, we’re sure that numerous services will rise using its API.

Title: Analysis:AI stock shock could spark broader gains in US market

Business NEW YORK : A development in the field of artificial intelligence that staggered asset prices could help set the stage for broader stock strength beyond the narrow group of technology shares that has propelled the market higher. Tech stocks, led by megacap companies, have been the driving force of the current bull market. The S&P 500 tech sector has gained some 90 per cent in the past two years, nearly doubling the gain for the overall benchmark index. But the sector stumbled badly on Monday as investors factored in implications from the low-cost Chinese AI model, with shares of high-profile tech names such as Nvidia, Broadcom and Oracle getting pummeled. Even as the group recouped some of those losses on Tuesday, investors were considering the changing character of the market, especially as they anticipate broader earnings improvement this year. "It's a catalyst for more balanced market leadership," said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services. "Ultimately, that's a positive because that means there are other areas for investors to make money." Market leadership has been particularly concentrated in a group of tech and tech-related megacap stocks known as the Magnificent Seven: Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook owner Meta Platforms and Tesla. Those stocks combined accounted for 55 per cent of the S&P 500's total return since the end of 2022 as of Monday, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. This year, however, the Magnificent Seven overall had been a negative influence on S&P 500 performance as of Monday. Signs of a nascent rotation were evident amid the DeepSeek fallout. Even as the S&P 500 fell 1.5 per cent on Monday, dragged down by stocks that carry heavy weights in the index, about 70 per cent of S&P 500 constituents rose, according to Barclays strategists. "Sector performance differed from similar risk-off days of the past few years, showing a notable 'broadening' tilt away from tech," the Barclays strategists said in a note. The S&P 500 growth index, which is heavily populated by tech stocks, dropped about 3.6 per cent on Monday, while the counterpart value stock index rose nearly 1 per cent. That was the biggest one-day percentage point advantage for value stocks over growth in the roughly 30 years of data on record, according to LSEG data. While Wall Street may take time to understand the implications from DeepSeek, Monday's "price action was a slap in the face to a lot of people who thought these stocks were invincible and the end result may be to take some of the chips out of that sector and spread it around to other areas of the market," said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel. In the options market, while there was some element of dip buying, traders appeared interested in broadening their horizon beyond the Magnificent Seven stocks. "I think people are using this as an opportunity to start to check out other sectors," said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group. Many investors already had been expecting stock strength to spread beyond tech and the Magnificent Seven, stemming from earnings trends. While Magnificent Seven earnings growth far exceeded performance for the rest of the S&P 500 over the past year, that gap is expected to close. In 2025, Magnificent Seven earnings are expected to rise 19 per cent against a 12.3 per cent increase for the rest of the index, said Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at LSEG. A flood of quarterly earnings reports is due over the next few weeks, including Microsoft, Meta and Tesla on Wednesday and Apple on Thursday. "That's important to watch these earnings come in," said Don Nesbitt, senior portfolio manager at F/m Investments. "You have some signals that, yes, things could be broadening out here." Plenty of investors remain bullish on tech and even some who expect a market broadening say the group can continue to do well. Indeed, the tech sector bounced back on Tuesday, rising over 3 per cent, but was still lower than before the DeepSeek news rippled through markets. Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management, said DeepSeek could lead to a rotation to companies that could gain from access to lower-cost AI, with software stocks among the potential beneficiaries. He manages portfolios that hold software stocks including Microsoft, ServiceNow and Salesforce. Monday's market action gave a "jolt" to a potential market broadening, said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital. But given how long tech has held the market reins, Todd said, "it's going to take some time for that to turn."

Screens display a news conference by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York, Wednesday, Jan. 29, 2025. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) HONG KONG – U.S. stock indexes slipped Wednesday after the Federal Reserve opted not to cut interest rates for the first time since it began trying to help the economy through easier rates in September. The S&P 500 fell 0.5% following the Fed’s widely expected decision. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 137 points, or 0.3%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.5%. Recommended Videos The reaction was also relatively muted in the bond market following the Fed’s decision, which could hint at rates staying on hold for a while following their swift drop at the end of 2024. Lower rates would help the economy by making it cheaper for U.S. households and companies to borrow, but the downside is they could also give inflation more fuel. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said after the decision that the central bank could cut rates if inflation were to slow further or if the job market suddenly weakened. But “right now, we don’t see that, and we see things as in a really good place for policy and for the economy, and so we feel like we don’t need to be in a hurry to make any adjustments.” While Wall Street would almost always prefer lower interest rates, “we would continue to focus on why the Fed won’t cut anytime soon, specifically a strong economy and labor, which bodes well for solid corporate earnings growth,” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Wednesday's relatively calm movements for financial markets offered some respite following two days of disruption driven by doubts about the artificial-intelligence boom. A Chinese upstart, DeepSeek, has raised nearly existential questions for some of the AI industry after saying it developed a large-language model that can compete with the world’s best without having to use top-flight chips. That casts doubt about whether AI development broadly will require as much spending on chips, vast data centers and electricity as Wall Street and Big Tech had been assuming. That in turn has caused huge swings for stocks across the industry, particularly for Nvidia. The company, whose stock has almost become a symbol of the AI bonanza, fell 4% Wednesday after plunging nearly 17% Monday and then jumping nearly 9% Tuesday. It was the single heaviest weight dragging the S&P 500 lower, by far. Big gains for Nvidia and other Big Tech companies had been instrumental in the S&P 500’s rallying to back-to-back yearly gains of more than 20% for the first time since before the millennium. Nvidia alone accounted for more than a fifth of all of the S&P 500's total return last year. Elsewhere on Wall Street, Starbucks rose 8.1% after delivering a better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Brian Niccol said the chain is planning to cut its food and beverage offerings by 30% over the course of this year to simplify operations and speed service, part of its efforts to turn the company around. T-Mobile US rallied 6.3% after topping Wall Street’s expectations for both profit and revenue in the last three months of 2024. It also said it expects to add between a net 5.5 million and 6 million in postpaid customers this year. Brinker International jumped 16.3% after the company behind Chili’s restaurants delivered better results than expected. CEO Kevin Hochman said Chili’s attracted new customers and that its return customers were coming more frequently. Railroad operator Norfolk Southern rose 1.8% after beating Wall Street’s profit forecasts. There is also growing optimism that a Republican-controlled Congress could ease restrictions on the industry. Frontier Group Holdings climbed 5.3% after announcing it would try for a second time to merge with Spirit Airlines, which sought bankruptcy protection late last year. Frontier said the proposed deal would include newly issued Frontier debt and common stock. Trump Media & Technology Group rose after announcing it would be getting into the financial services business via a partnership with Charles Schwab. TMTG said more details would be released later this year, and what had been a double-digit gain for the notoriously volatile stock shrank to an increase of 6.8%. On the losing end of Wall Street was Danaher, which fell 9.7% after the life sciences, biotechnology and diagnostics company reported results for the latest quarter that just missed analysts’ expectations. All told, the S&P 500 fell 28.39 points to 6,039.31. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 136.83 to 44,713.52, and the Nasdaq composite sank 101.26 to 19,632.32. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury held at 4.53%, where it was late Tuesday. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed in Europe. ASML’s stock jumped 5.6% in Amsterdam after announcing strong revenue on demand for its advanced chipmaking tools. In Asia, where many markets were closed for holidays, Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1%. ___ AP Writers Matt Ott and Zimo Zhong contributed. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Title: “This is a wake-up call" - the DeepSeek disruption: 10 experts weigh in

Will DeepSeek forever change the AI industry? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. New AI chatbot DeepSeek is taking the technology world by storm, and has even dethroned ChatGPT from top spot on the iOS App store. There's certainly a lot of speculation about the potential DeepSeek holds, as well as what this could mean for some of the biggest players in tech right now. Plenty of both new and existing firms have invested billions of dollars into Large Language Models in the last few months alone - but DeepSeek has the opportunity to cause chaos in the venture capital world. Having caused the biggest drop in the US stock market in history, the chatbot is understandably a huge talking point - but what are the experts’ predictions? There’s no denying that DeepSeek arriving on the scene has been disruptive, and although the expert opinion isn’t unanimous, the significantly lower development cost is definitely turning heads. If you're confused about what DeepSeek is, or why its causing so much of a stir, check out our article here explaining all you need to know, The pressure is certainly on for US tech firms to respond, but it may not be as destructive as it seems. We heard from 10 experts in the technology industry; Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Steve Povonly, Senior Director of Security Research & Competitive Intelligence at Exabeam: "The release of Chinese-developed DeepSeek has thrown US tech markets into turmoil; this is both justifiable and also perhaps, a bit overblown. The emergence of a technology that ultimately optimizes chip usage and efficiency is likely to apply pressure on existing large chip vendors, which is a very good thing. As the adage goes: "Pressure yields diamonds" and in this case, I believe competition in this market will drive global optimization, lower costs, and sustain the tailwinds AI needs to drive profitable solutions in the short and longer term." Mike Follett, CEO and Founder of Lumen Research: “Last week, Sam Altman and Elon Musk were AI monopolists. Now, it is clear that competition will reduce costs and loosen the grip hold of the biggest players. This represents an opportunity for marketers enabling them to build agents designed for specific problems, at a speed, scale and at a price that drives ROI.” Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group: “This is a wake-up call for markets. The assumption that tariffs could contain China’s technological ambitions is being dismantled in real time. DeepSeek’s breakthrough is proof that innovation will always find a way forward, regardless of economic barriers.” “By restricting China’s access to high-end semiconductors, Washington sought to slow its progress in AI. Instead, it has fueled an acceleration in domestic innovation, forcing Chinese firms to find alternatives. DeepSeek’s achievement is a direct result of this shift. “Rather than being crippled by US sanctions, Beijing has cultivated AI models that require significantly less computing power, diminishing its reliance on American technology and eroding US leverage over global supply chains.” Aleksandr Yampolskiy, CEO of SecurityScorecard: “DeepSeek is trained on 14.8 trillion diverse tokens whereas OpenAI is trained only on 13 trillion. It also costs radically less to train DeepSeek at $6M while OpenAI costs allegedly $100M, making DeepSeek 16.6X more efficient.” “We are living in fascinating times. While "constraints in capital" may seem like a challenge, history has shown us (and DeepSeek has demonstrated) that these constraints often spark innovation and creativity. Security for AI will only become more critical. In a world where the lines between deepfake and human-generated content blur, and where biased information can shape our opinions, the need for robust security and ethical practices will grow exponentially.” Dr. Kjell Carlsson, Head of AI strategy at Domino Data Lab: “Deepseek’s success serves as a powerful reminder that the value of AI lies not in the size of your infrastructure or the exclusivity of your models, but in how effectively they are leveraged to deliver impact. By developing cutting-edge generative AI models without relying on the latest, most expensive hardware, Deepseek has demonstrated that agility and strategy can outpace raw computational power. Their achievements also highlight the vulnerability of incumbents in the generative AI space—proving that open-source innovation continues to be a powerful equalizer, enabling challengers to match and even surpass established players years into the revolution.” “For companies seeking to maximise value from AI, the lesson is clear: success hinges on flexibility and capability, not exclusive partnerships or infrastructure scale. Rather than locking into specific LLM providers or focusing solely on hardware access, organisations should prioritise building the end-to-end capabilities to source AI innovations, design solutions tailored to their unique needs, and operationalise them effectively. This approach ensures that businesses remain agile, competitive, and prepared to harness the next wave of AI advancements, wherever they emerge.” Bradford Levy, Assistant Professor of Accounting, University of Chicago Booth School of Business: “DeepSeek has sent shock waves through the tech industry – directly challenging tech giants like Meta, Microsoft and Open AI." “Until now, it’s been assumed their expertise in designing and operating large-scale distributed systems are essential for training state of the art models. But the development of R1 suggests otherwise – if these models can be trained using 90% fewer chips, the implications for valuation models are massive." “This opens the door for smaller, more agile players to compete, potentially driving more innovation. With limited resources, they proved that scrappy, innovative teams can shake up the industry, even on a shoestring budget." “While impressive, we should remain skeptical of any claims made by those with a vested interest in their own success. Before jumping to conclusions about the broader AI landscape, we need more time to test these models and understand how they achieved these numbers.” Professor Geoff Webb, Department of Data Science & AI, Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University: “The emergence of DeepSeek is a significant moment in the AI revolution. Until now it has seemed that billion dollar investments and access to the latest generation of specialised NVIDIA processors were prerequisites for developing state-of-the-art systems.” “This effectively limited control to a small number of leading US-based tech corporations. Due to US embargoes on exporting the latest generation of NVIDIA processors, it also locked out China.” “DeepSeek claims to have developed a new Large Language Model, similar to Chat GPT or Llama, that rivals the state-of-the-art for a fraction of the cost using the less advanced NVIDIA processors that are currently available to China. If this is true, it means that the US tech sector no longer has exclusive control of the AI technologies, opening them to wider competition and reducing the prices they can charge for access to and use of their systems.” “Looking beyond the implications for the stock market, current AI technologies are US-centric and embody US values and culture. This new development has the potential to create more diversity through the development of new AI systems.” “It also has the potential to make AI more accessible for researchers around the world both for developing new technologies and for applying them in diverse areas including healthcare.” Aditya Sood, VP of Security Engineering and AI Strategy at Aryaka: "Open-source AI models like DeepSeek, while offering accessibility and innovation, are increasingly vulnerable to supply chain attacks triggered during large-scale cyberattacks. These attacks, where adversaries exploit the reliance on third-party dependencies, pre-trained models, or public repositories, can have severe consequences. Adversaries may tamper with pre-trained models by embedding malicious code, backdoors, or poisoned data, which can compromise downstream applications. Additionally, attackers may target the software supply chain by manipulating dependencies, libraries, or scripts used during model training or deployment. This can lead to systemic AI functionality corruption." Renuka Nadkarni CPO at Aryaka: "The sudden popularity of DeepSeek comes at a price. There are two dimensions of this. First, threat actors are likely to adopt this new tool now that it's widely available. Second, DeepSeek was a victim of a large-scale malicious attack. This means that their system could be compromised and subject to several of the known AI model attacks. Known AI model vulnerabilities, data risks, and infrastructure threats come into play here." “While the unavailability of the service is an easy and visible attack on its infrastructure, the bigger concern lies in the undetected attacks on its model and data. These hidden threats could compromise benign users and enable other malicious activities." Dan Goman, CEO, Ateliere Creative Technologies: "The market’s reaction to the latest news surrounding DeepSeek is nothing short of an overcorrection. While the enthusiasm around breakthroughs in AI often drives headlines and market speculation, this feels like yet another case where excitement has outpaced evidence. Investors should be cautious about blindly jumping on the hype train without asking the tough questions." "In summary, while Deepseek’s story is intriguing, it’s imperative to separate fact from speculation. The market needs to temper its enthusiasm and demand more transparency before awarding DeepSeek the crown of AI innovation. Until then, skepticism remains a healthy and necessary stance."

The release of a less capital-intensive artificial intelligence model from China’s DeepSeek sent a chill through the U.S. stock market this week, headlined by losses Monday and Wednesday from Nvidia, the Silicon Valley giant which designs most of the pricey semiconductor technology powering the AI revolution. DeepSeek has been accused of using outputs generated by OpenAI's tools to train its latest AI model. Jan. 29, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends Wednesday trading down 4% in a turbulent session that wiped out about $130 billion in market value, with earnings reports from top customers Meta, Nvidia and Tesla all due this afternoon all potential catalysts for further movement in the stock. To recap Nvidia’s whipsaw week: Its market value fell by about $590 billion Monday, rose by roughly $260 billion Tuesday and dropped $130 billion Wednesday. Wall Street analysts still mostly view the selloff as a overreaction, and Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya wrote Wednesday to clients they “view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity” for Nvidia stock, reaffirming faith in hundreds of billions of dollars of spending this decade in the AI technology which Nvidia designs. Jan. 29, 1:30 p.m. EST President Donald Trump is considering placing more restrictions on Nvidia’s semiconductor chip sales to China beyond what the Biden administration placed in an effort to limit AI advancement in the Asian country, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources. It’s unclear if the potentially amped-up controls are directly tied to the DeepSeek fallout — Nvidia said Monday the Chinese AI group fully complied with existing export laws with its use of Nvidia’s technology — though Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, laid into DeepSeek at his Wednesday confirmation hearing, saying: “Nvidia’s chips, which they bought tons of, and they found their ways around, drive their DeepSeek model. It’s got to end.” China accounted for more than 15% of Nvidia’s revenues in its most recent quarter. Jan. 29, 12 p.m. EST Nvidia’s Wall Street woes continued as shares dropped about 5% by midday, bringing the stock’s loss this week back up to nearly 15%. Jan. 29, 9:40 a.m. EST After mounting a historic comeback Wednesday, Nvidia stock fell again, declining about 3% in the first 10 minutes of regular trading, leading a broader tech slump as the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Tesla all declined roughly 1% apiece. Jan. 29, 8:30 a.m. EST New York-listed shares of Chinese technology giant Alibaba rise more than 3% in premarket trading, set to open at their highest level since early November. Alibaba said earlier Wednesday the latest version of its Qwen generative AI model scored better on several performance tests than the models from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI and Meta. Jan. 29, 3 a.m. EST OpenAI told the Financial Times that it has seen some evidence that its AI models were used by DeepSeek to train its own—which would be a breach of the ChatGPT maker’s terms of services. Bloomberg previously reported that Microsoft and OpenAI were investigating whether DeepSeek gained access to OpenAI’s data outputs in an unauthorized manner. Jan. 29, 12 a.m. EST White House artificial intelligence czar David Sacks told Fox News that there was “substantial evidence” suggesting that Deepseek had “distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,” adding “I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this.” In this context, distillation is a process where an AI model uses responses generated by other, more powerful, AI models to aid its development. Sacks added that over the next few months he expects leading U.S. AI companies will be "taking steps to try and prevent distillation” to slow down “these copycat models.” Jan. 28, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends normal trading up 8.8%, scoring its best percentage gain in six months. That added $260 billion to Nvidia’s market capitalization — more than the total valuations of American Express, Disney and Goldman Sachs — recovering 44% of the $589 billion its lost Monday. Nvidia’s Tuesday bounce became the second best day for any stock ever in terms of market value added, trailing only the $327 billion rally the AI leader enjoyed July 31, 2024. Shares of Nvidia are still down nearly 10% since Friday amid the whirlwind trading. Jan. 28, 1:45 p.m. ESTApple stock rallied 4% to about $239 per share, building on its 3% gain Monday as many of its Silicon Valley peers faltered and extending its market value added this week to about $240 billion. The two-day bounce for Apple shares, which had suffered a 14% pullback in the month ending Friday, comes as investors warm to the iPhone maker’s approach to largely watch the generative AI arms race from the sidelines as its trillion-dollar peers like Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft invested billions into generative AI projects. Apple emerges as a “relative winner” as DeepSeek shifted investor narratives on AI, wrote Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak in a Tuesday note to clients, explaining Apple’s “AI ambitions are far more contained” than the other “magnificent seven” American tech leaders. Apple also stands to greatly benefit from any advancements from large-language models, like DeepSeek’s, as Apple “owns the most valuable consumer technology distribution platform that exists,” Nowak added. Whether Apple stock’s “contained” generative AI ambitions were the result of financial discipline or inadequate innovation is up to interpretation, but Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern quipped, “Apple’s behind-everyone-else-in-AI approach look like a calculated master plan.” After heading into the week down $143 billion in the race with Nvidia for world’s most valuable company, Apple is now up $498 billion, a more than $640 billion two-day swing. Jan. 28, 12:20 p.m. ESTNvidia settles into a more than 5.5% gain by midday trading, helping lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to a more than 1.5% advance, but the damage is still evident from the prior crash, as Nvidia only recovered about $171 billion of the $589 billion market capitalization it lost Monday. Jan. 28, 10 a.m. ESTMorgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore offers perhaps the most palpably negative major analyst reaction to DeepSeek, cutting his price target for Nvidia from $166 to $152 due to the “deflationary” prospects of cheaper AI buildouts and the potential for “further export controls or reduce spending enthusiasm” — Morgan Stanley maintains a buy rating for the stock and its $152 target implies 27% upside from Nvidia’s $120 share price Tuesday. Jan. 28, 9:35 a.m. ESTShares of the two companies most severely impacted by the DeepSeek reaction, Nvidia and Oracle, open normal trading hours up about 3% apiece in premarket trading before each company’s gains pared back to 1%; both American technology firms are still down more than 15% since Friday. Jan. 28, 8:45 a.m. ESTAnalyst reactions to the historic selloff largely characterized the losses as out of proportion: UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said Oracle’s drop “felt excessive” and Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore added “geopolitical dynamics are a key driver of this volatility” in tech stocks in respective notes to clients. Jan. 28, 6:00 a.m. ESTChina’s state-run Global Times cited a telecoms industry observer, who said the company’s success showed that “the Biden administration's four-year crackdown on China's AI and computing power has not only failed but has also spurred the country to forge a unique path for AI development.” People within China’s tech industry also hailed DeepSeek’s success. In a widely shared post on the social media platform Weibo, Game Science co-founder Feng Ji—the studio which published the hit game Black Myth: Wukong—wrote “DeepSeek may be a scientific and technology achievement that can change a nation’s fate...Such a shocking breakthrough coming from a purely Chinese company. Jan. 27, 10:00 p.m. ESTOpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised DeepSeek’s R1, saying it is an “impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,” and added “we will obviously deliver much better models and...we will pull up some releases.” Jan. 27, 6:30 p.m. ESTPresident Donald Trump said at a House Republican retreat that the launch of the AI model was “a positive development” but should be considered a “wake-up” call for U.S. industries, lauding the move for what he hoped would usher in a future of “coming up with a faster method of AI, and much less expensive method.” Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTThe DeepSeek-driven stock market plunge caused some of the world’s wealthiest people to lose tens of billions on paper, led by Oracle’s Larry Ellison (net worth down $27.6 billion) and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang (down $20.8 billion)—here’s a full list. Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTStocks were battered by DeepSeek’s debut: The S&P 500 closed down 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged just over 3%—its worst day since Dec. 18 and fourth-worst day of the last two years. Jan. 27, 4 p.m. ESTSemiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia closed down 17%, knocking $589 billion off its market cap in the biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history—along with heavy losses at chipmakers Broadcom (17%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (13%), and smaller falls for Microsoft (2%) and Tesla (2%). Jan. 27, 3:28 p.m. ESTForbes found DeepSeek refused to answer questions on several controversial topics linked to the Chinese government, like, “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” and “What are the biggest criticisms of Xi Jinping?” The model did provide detailed answers when asked about common criticisms of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Jan. 27, 3 p.m. ESTNvidia releases its first statement on DeepSeek as its stock dipped to a 18% loss on the day, calling the Chinese company’s model “an excellent AI advancement” — the full statement from a Nvidia spokesperson is as follows: “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Jan. 27, 12:50 p.m. ESTDavid Sacks, President Donald Trump’s “AI & Crypto Czar,” offers his first comments on DeepSeek, saying the Chinese company’s success “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and “we can’t be complacent,” supporting Trump’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s executive order placing guardrails on AI development, which Sacks said “hamstrung” U.S. AI innovation. Jan. 27, 12:45 p.m. EST Oracle chairman Larry Ellison (down $24.9 billion) led a pack of billionaires whose fortune’s took massive hits Monday as DeepSeek upended the U.S. stock market, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ($19.8 billion), Dell CEO Michael Dell ($12.4 billion), Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($5.3 billion) and Google cofounder Larry Page ($4.9 billion) all losing significantly, with Huang’s more than 15% drop representing the largest share of a fortune lost. Jan. 27, 12:30 p.m. ESTU.S. stocks got walloped Monday morning: The S&P 500 was down about 1.8% at 12:30 p.m. EST, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.4%. Jan. 27, 11:15 a.m. ESTShares of Nvidia plunged 15% by 11:15 a.m. EST, heading toward its worst daily percentage loss since March 2020, when stocks briefly crashed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially becoming the single greatest single-day loss in terms of market cap of any company in history. Broadcom had slipped 16% as of 11:30 a.m. Jan. 27, 9:30 a.m. ESTDomestic leaders in AI showed stinging losses at market open Monday as Microsoft dropped 4% and Tesla slipped 2%, with semiconductor chip architect Nvidia diving 12% and other big chip stocks like Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company falling more than 10% apiece. Jan. 27, 7:30 a.m. ESTJPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande questioned in a note to clients how DeepSeek’s low-cost success “is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” Jan. 27, 5 a.m. ESTReferring to the Magnificent 7 set of trillion-dollar U.S. companies including Nvidia and Tesla accounting for much of the 2020s bull market, Yardeni Research founder Ed Yardeni noted a “competitive threat to their magnificence has emerged from China.” Jan. 26Billionaire investor Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s R1 model "AI's Sputnik moment." Jan. 25The DeepSeek mobile app became the No. 1 app in iPhone stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the U.S. and the U.K. Jan. 22ByteDance, another Chinese company, revealed an update to its flagship AI model and word started circulating that the new overseas products posed a strategic threat to the U.S. tech giants pursuing AI dominance. Jan. 20DeepSeek launched its R1 advanced reasoning model, claiming it rivaled OpenAI's o1 product on several performance benchmarks and was created for far less money than spent by American companies like Microsoft and Meta. The selloff stems from weekend panic over last week’s release from the relatively unknown Chinese firm DeepSeek of its competitive generative AI model rivaling OpenAI, the American firm backed by Microsoft and Nvidia, and its viral chatbot ChatGPT, with DeepSeek notably running at a fraction of the cost of U.S.-based rivals. The idea of a rival undercutting the largely U.S.-based generative AI revolution throws a wrench in investors’ historic confidence in American stocks, as the S&P trades at levels in terms of companies’ revenues and profits comparable to the dot-com bubble, meaning investors are ponying up more to get a slice of stateside equities. DeepSeek is “bad news” for American tech behemoths with “plans to dominate the AI market with their expensive AI services,” cautioned Yardeni. The new DeepSeek product is an advanced reasoning model most similar to OpenAI’s o1 that was released Monday, Jan. 20. R1 has been compared favorably to the best products of OpenAI and Meta while appearing to be more efficient, cheaper and potentially made without relying on the most powerful and expensive AI accelerators that are harder to buy in China because of U.S. export controls. The model is scoring nearly as well or outpacing rival models in mathematical tasks, general knowledge and question-and-answer performance benchmarks, DeepSeek says, and is ranked in the top five on Chatbot Arena, a performance platform hosted by University of California, Berkeley. Don’t “buy into the doomsday scenarios currently playing out” about DeepSeek, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a Monday note to clients, adding the “panic over the weekend seems overblown.” DeepSeek’s assertion it cost just $5.6 million in computing power to develop its model is “categorically false,” according Rasgon, who said the misleading figure does not account for other “substantial” costs related to its AI model’s development. American AI billionaires like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and ScaleAI CEO Alexandr Wang theorize DeepSeek actually owns more than $1 billion worth of Nvidia equipment. DeepSeek is a new entrant to the AI large-language model arms race involving OpenAI, Facebook parent Meta and Google parent Alphabet. The AI battle came to a national stage last week when President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion joint venture building out the infrastructure necessary to power OpenAI’s artificial general intelligence initiatives. In his speech last Tuesday, Trump specifically called out the importance for the U.S. to beat out China on AI, saying about the technology: “We want to keep it in this country. China is a competitor and others are competitors.” Major tech figures including billionaire Trump allies Marc Andreessen and Vivek Ramaswamy each likened DeepSeek’s new technology to a “Sputnik moment” for American AI. Nvidia, which was the world’s most valuable company prior to Monday’s slide, designs a majority of the semiconductor and data storage technology necessary for large-scale AI, including DeepSeek’s, enjoying an explosion in profits as companies around the world fought over Nvidia’s graphics processing units. The magnificent seven includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, accounting for about $17 trillion of market value between the seven giants. The AI revolution boosted American stocks to record leadership in the global stock market, with U.S. companies accounting for 67% of the world equity market at the end of 2024, according to MSCI. The S&P is up 201% over the last decade through Friday, trouncing the 8% loss for China’s leading CSI 300 index and the 33% gain for Europe’s Stoxx 600 over the period, according to FactSet data. Monday’s selloff sets the stage for a notable week for Big Tech stocks. Meta, Microsoft and Tesla will all report fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday afternoon, while Apple will follow Thursday.

Title: DeepSeek Send Panic Shivers Down the US AI Industry

We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. Key Takeaways A new Chinese AI model has taken the world by storm. Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has just released the latest version of its open-source AI model – DeepSeek V3, and it’s better than the latest ChatGPT 4.0, Llama3, and Claude AI models. In fact, in some areas, it even surpasses its rivals. To add a cherry to the top, its training and development cost is just a fraction of that of its rivals. Where giants like OpenAI and Meta have pumped billions of dollars into data centers and AI training, DeepSeek has built a model from scratch for just $5.5M. The US stock market bore the brunt of this new breakthrough, wiping off $1 trillion for investors in a single day. Nvidia was the most affected stock – it fell almost 17% in a day. Nvidia investors saw $593B vaporize into thin air – the single biggest market cap loss for a company on Wall Street. Nvidia’s whole business is centered around selling massively expensive GPUs at 80-90% margins. In contrast, DeepSeek built the whole model on around 2,000 Nvidia H800 GPUs. DeepSeek has rocked the belief that the AI industry is a capital-intensive one and only big corporation giants can participate in it. As per reports, DeepSeek uses efficient computing techniques such as a “mixture of experts” approach to lower the cost. Now that the industry knows similar results can be achieved with a fraction of resources, the whole AI chip industry business may falter. The only downside might be that the model is trained on data up to October 2023. But this is only for the web version. The app seems to have access to the latest information. DeepSeek stepping foot into the industry has sent the rest of the players into a frenzy. As per an inside source, the generative artificial intelligence division of Meta is in “panic mode”. Engineers are moving frantically to dissect DeepSeek and copy anything and everything we can from it. I’m not even exaggerating. – Meta employee The biggest worry of the management right now is how they will justify the massive cost of their tools and the massive salary that their “leaders” are drawing when China has managed to create an equally competent tool at such a low price. Even President Donald Trump praised DeepSeek in a speech at a Republican retreat, applauding its technological breakthrough and saying it should be a wake-up call for American companies. OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman seemed to be a little more calm in his response. He took to X and said that it was quite “invigorating” to have new competitors in the market. He also applauded the company for delivering that kind of service for such a low cost and in the end, promised to speed up some of OpenAI’s own releases. It might seem that DeepSeek is the next big thing. And it might be so, considering that it has already become the No.1 downloaded free app on Apple’s app store. Its open-source model makes its codes and technical details open to all. This might also speed up progress through collaboration. But there are some hurdles in the way. For instance, so far the tool censors all topics that are not favored by the Chinese government. However, the question is how viable this approach will be if it tries to make it big in the global market. Plus, China is not on good terms with many of its neighbors. We have all seen how it went down for TikTok. So in this environment, will DeepSeek manage to survive or will it sink after this banging launch?

Asian stocks have advanced in thin Lunar New Year trading following a rebound on Wall Street driven by tech stocks as the panic over Chinese AI company DeepSeek faded HONG KONG -- Asian stocks advanced Wednesday in thin Lunar New Year trading following a rebound on Wall Street driven by tech stocks as the panic over Chinese AI company DeepSeek faded. Most markets in Asia were closed for holidays. Investors were focusing on the Federal Reserve’s rate decision due later in the day. U.S. futures were flat and oil prices fell. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 index recovered from Tuesday's losses, gaining 0.7% to 39,273.49. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.7% to 8,455.70 after data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed the Consumer Price Index increased by 0.2% in the December 2024 quarter, marking the smallest rise since the June 2020 quarter, when inflation declined during the COVID-19 outbreak. India's Sensex was up 0.5%, while the SET in Bangkok shed 0.2%. On Tuesday, tech stocks bounced back after tumbling Monday on doubts over whether the artificial-intelligence frenzy really needs all the dollars being poured into it. The S&P 500 climbed 0.9% to 6,067.70, clawing back more than half of its earlier drop. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3% to 44,850.35, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 2% to 19,733.59 after sliding 3.1 % the day before. The spotlight remained on Nvidia, whose chips are powering much of the move into AI and whose stock has become a symbol of the surrounding frenzy. It rose 8.8% after plunging nearly 17% on Monday, which was its worst drop since the 2020 COVID crash. Other AI-related companies also held steadier, including chip company Broadcom, which rose 2.6%. Constellation Energy picked up 1.4% after plummeting nearly 21% on Monday. It had earlier rallied on expectations it will help supply the electricity that vast AI data centers would gobble up. Such revenues are threatened after DeepSeek, a Chinese company, said it was able to develop a large language model that can perform as well as big U.S. rivals but at a fraction of the cost. That raises questions about whether all the spending expected for AI chips and electricity will need to happen. AI-related stocks have been Wall Street’s biggest stars in recent years, soaring on expectations that big spending will only continue to grow. The gains, though, also created criticism that the stock prices had simply gone too high, too fast. It’s still uncertain how much DeepSeek’s development will upend the AI industry. While it could mean less growth in spending than expected for data centers, electricity and chips, it could also boost other areas. “If AI becomes less expensive to use, we think businesses will adopt it more quickly, making a greater investment in AI software,” according to James Egelhof, chief U.S. economist at BNP Paribas. “We think this acceleration in adoption could mean a rise in software investment that offsets – or even dwarfs – any deceleration in spending on data center structures, hardware and related investment.” Some of Wall Street’s most influential companies, including Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla, will release profit reports later this week. A report showing confidence among U.S. consumers wasn’t as strong as economists expected made relatively small waves in the bond market. The more anticipated event will come on Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve will announce its latest decision on interest rates. The widespread expectation is that it will leave the federal funds rate alone. If that proves true, it would be the first meeting where the Fed did not cut rates to give the economy a boost since it began doing so in September. In other dealings Wednesday, benchmark U.S. crude shed 14 cents to $73.63 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 18 cents to $76.31 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar fell to 155.09 Japanese yen from 155.53 yen. The euro cost $1.0438, down from $1.0432. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Stock traded at ₹365.10 on the NSE, lower by 7.74%. As India anticipates the Union Budget 2025-26, several expectations have emerged that could significantly impact wealth management strategies. There is an expectation that the government may raise the basic exemption limit for personal income tax, with EY India suggesting an increase from ₹3 lakh to ₹5 lakh. This move could enhance disposable income and stimulate economic growth. Investors are also hopeful for a more streamlined capital gains tax structure across various asset classes, which could reduce complexity and improve compliance. Deloitte anticipates that the government may introduce measures to simplify the tax structure, potentially facilitating smoother merger and acquisition deals. On the investment front, the government is expected to maintain a strong focus on infrastructure development, with previous budgets allocating a capital expenditure outlay of 11.1 trillion rupees for this purpose. Similar or increased allocations are anticipated, continuing to drive growth in sectors like construction, cement, steel, and engineering. Furthermore, with the global shift towards sustainability, there is an expectation for increased emphasis on renewable energy and green technologies. Incentives for green bonds or Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investments may also be introduced, aligning with global sustainability goals. For wealth management, these changes could necessitate adjustments in investment strategies to maintain tax efficiency, especially with potential modifications in income and capital gains taxes. The anticipated increased government spending in infrastructure and green energy sectors could also make related investment avenues more lucrative. As regulatory changes, particularly concerning mutual funds and other investment vehicles, are likely, staying informed and consulting with financial advisors will be crucial for navigating these shifts effectively. In summary, the upcoming budget is expected to introduce measures that could influence various aspects of wealth management, from tax planning to investment strategies. “The upcoming budget holds the promise of propelling India’s economy to greater heights in FY2025. With an immense focus on “Make in India” initiatives, an increasing regulatory oversight in the financial sector and a thriving global capability hub as key themes, the budget could further address issues faced by foreign companies doing business in India, attract investments for MSME entities and address inflationary pressures. By focusing on export competitiveness, sustainable infrastructure, and inclusive growth measures, the budget has the potential to strengthen India’s economic resilience and position it as a leader in the global economic landscape” The board has approved enhancement and combination of the previously approved fund-raising limit by way of nonconvertible debentures (“NCDs”) from Rs. 5,000 crores to Rs. 11,000 crores, which are to be raised through public issue or private placement, or a mix thereof. It has also approved raising of funds for an amount not exceeding ₹5,000 crore via QIP. Shares traded at ₹523.55 on the NSE, higher by 5.30% WhatsApp Image 2025-01-27 at 15.02.34_a6c1e5bf.jpg The number of stocks that recorded a 52-week high was 51, and those that hit a 52-week low was 144. A total of 304 stocks traded in the upper circuit, and 257 in the lower circuit. “To empower Indian farmers and accelerate agricultural growth, we anticipate exempting essential agricultural inputs such as agrochemicals, drones, and modern implements from GST or reducing the rate to a maximum of 5%. The current 18% GST on these items discourages farmers from adopting advanced technologies vital for bridging the yield gap with developed nations. This high tax burden often forces farmers to rely on low-quality alternatives, leading to reduced productivity, lower incomes, and significant losses for the nation in terms of GDP and food security. Additionally, lowering the import duty on pesticide technicals and formulations continues to 10% making advanced innovative crop solutions more affordable and accessible. Encouraging domestic R&D through reinstating a 200% tax deduction on research expenses and allocating a dedicated budget for agrochemical innovation will foster self-reliance and reduce dependency on imports. We appreciate the various initiatives by the Hon’ble Agriculture Minister, Shri Shivraj Singh Chouhan, giving focus to the agriculture sector under the dynamic leadership of Hon’ble Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi. India’s agricultural research needs urgent attention. Only 0.06% of GDP is allocated to R&D, compared to 4.5-5% in developed nations, limiting our capacity to innovate. Reinstating the 200% tax incentive for R&D would encourage domestic innovation, reduce dependence on foreign technology, and ensure farmers benefit from cutting-edge solutions. The agrochemical industry, contributing USD 5.5 billion annually to India’s agricultural exports, is pivotal to strengthening agriculture. Strategic measures like tax incentives, a Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme and a review of the Insecticides Act to streamline faster new product approvals will empower farmers, enhance productivity, and position India as a global leader in agriculture.” “As we approach the Union Budget for 2025, we anticipate a comprehensive and broad-based fiscal plan from the Modi government, marking its first full-fledged budget in this term. The government is expected to focus on continued infrastructure investment, particularly in critical areas such as housing, electricity, and employment generation. The targeted fiscal deficit is projected to be around 4.5% of GDP, reflecting the government’s commitment to maintaining macroeconomic stability amidst global uncertainties. While there may be discussions around potential relief for taxpayers, we do not anticipate any major changes in the overall tax structure in this budget. Instead, the focus will likely remain on enhancing capital expenditure and stimulating consumption to revitalize the economy, ultimately balancing support for growth initiatives with fiscal responsibility and setting a positive direction for India’s economy in the coming fiscal year.” “The Union Budget should focus on continuity in its policies—frequent changes can disrupt confidence and long-term planning. Therefore, it is imperative to maintain 98% of the existing framework and communicate to the world about the consistency maintained. In fact, the Budget should focus on improving internal governance—diverting resources towards more impactful initiatives and eliminating redundant schemes. Necessary changes should be made wherever required with supporting rationale. This will also create a business-friendly environment, which is essential for India to attain its goal of Viksit Bharat. Streamlined regulations and a robust single-window clearance system can remove obstacles form industries, helping them utilise their full potential and drive economic expansion. High-tech manufacturing sectors, especially space, semiconductors, and chips, must form the core of this approach. Expanding the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme beyond its current 14 sectors would further bolster India’s industrial base and enhance resilience against global disruptions. Agriculture is equally important and remains central to India’s economic fabric. Initiatives such as One District, One Warehouse, can minimise post-harvest losses and improve supply chain efficiency, resulting in an increase in farmer incomes. By rationalising GST, reforming labour laws and incentivising green technologies, India can address the burgeoning issue of climate change while fostering resilience. These interconnected efforts, backed by public-private collaboration, can transform India into a future-ready, globally competitive economy.” Shares up 2.76% on the NSE to trade at ₹1,400.05 Radico Khaitan reported its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹95.49 crore as against ₹75.15 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year Datamatics Global Services reported its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹74.61 crore as against ₹41.41 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Orient Electric board has approved the payment of interim dividend of Rs 0.75 per equity share and fixed Tuesday, February 04, 2025, as the record date. Company reported its net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹27.17 crore as against ₹24.33 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Reducing the LTCG tax on equities from 12.5% to 10% would leave an additional 2.5% of gains in investors’ hands as investable capital. This surplus capital is likely to be reinvested in the market, enhancing liquidity and deepening market penetration. Similarly, reintroducing indexation benefits for debt mutual funds would ensure that investors are taxed only on real gains, making long-term investments in debt markets more attractive. These changes align with global best practices and can create a virtuous cycle—encouraging more retail and institutional participation, strengthening capital markets, and driving sustainable long-term growth. A stronger push for the vehicle scrappage policy could be a game-changer. Enhancing scrappage incentives to 8–10% of a new vehicle’s price and providing stronger benefits for electric vehicle (EVs) adoption would modernize India’s automotive landscape. Expanding scrapping facilities and automating fitness tests would make the process seamless. More importantly, linking scrappage with EV adoption would accelerate India’s transition to cleaner mobility while generating jobs in manufacturing and recycling. These measures mirror global best practices, such as Germany’s Umweltprämie and China’s EV incentives. This move not only reduces pollution but also boosts GST revenues—making it a win-win for both the economy and the environment. Lowering the GST rate on health and life insurance premiums from 18% to 5% would significantly reduce costs, making it more affordable and accessible. A lower GST rate would encourage more people across income levels to invest in health and life coverage. While there may be an initial reduction in GST collections per policy, the long-term impact could be much more positive—higher insurance penetration would offset revenue losses, while also reducing the financial burden on public healthcare infrastructure aligning with the government’s broader objective of strengthening social safety nets. Targeted infrastructure investments in underserved areas, including rural housing under PMAY, health and wellness centres, and broadband expansion under BharatNet, would drive inclusive economic growth. Improved healthcare, digital access, and transport connectivity would uplift living standards, reduce poverty, and foster greater economic participation. For instance, extending housing and clean water access to marginalized communities would not only enhance quality of life but also stimulate local economies. Prioritizing such investments ensures equitable development, bridges regional disparities, and lays the foundation for sustainable growth, aligning with India’s broader economic and social objectives. Craftsman Automation’s consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 declined to ₹12.93 crore as against ₹81.47 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Deepak Fertilizers and Petrochemicals Corporation reported its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹253.09 crore as against ₹60.53 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Teamlease Services Limited reported its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹28.37 crore as against ₹31.12 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹124.10 crore as against ₹88.53 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. CAMS stock gained 3.71% on the NSE to ₹3,858.55 Maruti Suzuki India’s consolidated net profit increased by 16 per cent to ₹3,727 crore for the third quarter ended December 31, 2024, as against ₹3,207 crore in the October-December period of last fiscal. Ambuja Cements (ACL), an Adani Group company, is expected to report a top-line in the range of ₹8,022 crore to ₹9,076 crore in the December quarter, according to estimates from top stock broking firms. While Yes Securities sees a 1.3 per cent year-on-year decline in ACL’s Q3FY25 revenue, Nuvama Institutional Equities estimates a jump of up to 12 per cent jump. Net profit is expected to be in the range of ₹74 crore to ₹1,022 crore, representing a decline of 6 per cent to 32 per cent in net profit. Read full report here “Indian agriculture needs to be supported by strong research for the development of resilient seeds for better adoption to climatic changes. Sustained budgetary focus on varietal development can provide farmers with better and more climate-resilient options. This can be a great support to farmers for increasing yield by 15-40% from limited land resources. Agri infrastructure is a critical factor in the development of the sector. Last year a budget of INR 600 cr was allocated to AIF for promoting the creation of infrastructure at the farm and organisation level. The scheme should be promoted further with a larger budget to support micro infrastructure development not only in Agriculture but also in allied sectors such as dairy, fisheries, floriculture, beekeeping and medicinal plants. Further, schemes to promote digital agriculture should be promoted in the upcoming budget to enable seedless connectivity and data flow from producers to consumers. Digital infrastructure, supported by tools such as blockchain and IoT, can help farmers make better, informed decisions, create preparedness for nature’s unpredictability, and manage price fluctuations in the market.” CSB Bank reported an overall good set of numbers for the quarter ended December 2024. Here’s what stood out: In Q3 FY25, the banking sector has been impacted by liquidity tightness in the system, having a say on growth in deposits and consequentially the growth in advances. The system level growth in deposits was seen at 9.8 per cent year on year and the growth in advances at 11.2 per cent. However, CSB Bank was an exception. It’s business (deposits and advances) grew at over twice the system level growth, unlike some bigger banks. Deposits grew at 22.2 per cent and advances at 26.5 per cent year on year.

But then the price started to moderate. On Tuesday (January 28), aluminium futures (February) closed at ₹247.35. Although the price has dropped, we cannot really call it a trend reversal. Especially considering that a retracement is usual after a sharp up move. Read full report here ‘’The world seems to be different in the last one week. DeepSeek has taken the world by storm over last couple of days – DeepSeek R1, dropped last week is already comparing with OPEN AI’s top models across math, code, and reasoning tasks and at fraction of costs!! The platform is open source, and the massive research is out there for anyone to threadbare! The way all the semi names have given up gains and corrected, difficult to say, that we are done yet there as uncertainty would continue to prevail over what the true demand would be for the chips, fabrication plants, energy, etc. There is likely to be some commentary from the Mega Cap names later this week – Apple, MSFT, TSLA, META, ASML, etc – hopefully, some clarity may emerge on what DeepSeek would eventually mean for Big Tech. INDIA during the week extended the sell off, with SMID indices draw down now approaching 15-18% - already the biggest drawdown since start of 2022. We would be favouring a sharp bounce here, given how oversold the momentum indicators are, but any sustained rally would require some direction from FM (Saturday Budget) and RBI (easing of lending norms, rate cut, etc). RBI has already initiated some announcements as regards unconventional easing – need to follow up with more of such announcements and rate cut perhaps in Feb. Liquidity Deficit has ballooned to INR 3.1trn, prompting RBI to announce slew of measures like: · OMO purchase of INR 600bn in 3 equal tranches · 6mth tenor USD/INR buy/sell swap of $5bn on Jan 31st · Longer tenor 56-day VRR of INR 500bn on Feb 7th to add durability to liquidity the measures announced could improve the system liquidity deficit to INR 2.4trn by end March, with core deficit likely around INR 1.0-1.2trn, implying that more measures are likely to be announced. Our economist suggests that these are unconventional easing mechanisms, and probably precursor to a likely monetary policy easing too in Feb !! Having lost around 3% of its value so far in the month, Nifty looks on track to end January on a negative note to mark the fourth consecutive month of correction — an exceptionally rare occurrence that hasn’t been reported in the last 23 years. Fed action, slew of reforms in the budget and liquidity easing by the central bank will set the tone for the markets in the coming 2-3 months. The FII’s have been sellers almost to the tune to ~ 1 bn USD even in Jan. Technically a push beyond 23200 will determine the future trend.’’ “The Budget announced in July 2024 brought limited changes for individual taxpayers, leaving many to hope that the upcoming Budget 2025 will deliver the much-needed tax relief to alleviate their financial pressures. There is a strong expectation that the government will focus on improving taxpayers’ savings by introducing reforms such as a unified tax regime and enhanced deductions. The Dilemma of Old vs New Tax Regimes - The introduction of two tax regimes - Old Tax Regime (OTR) and New Tax Regime (NTR) - was intended to offer taxpayers flexibility, allowing them to choose the system that best suits their investments, savings habits, and preferences. However, the reality has been far more complex. Many taxpayers find themselves confused between the two regimes, often reassessing their choice not only during the year but also while filing their tax returns. In light of these complexities, the upcoming Budget should focus on simplifying the tax structure for individual taxpayers by consolidating the current dual regimes into a single, cohesive tax framework. While this shift may take time, it is anticipated that the OTR may eventually be phased out, with its abolition ideally scheduled for FY 2026-27 to provide ample time for taxpayers, employers, and financial institutions to adjust. A Single, More Beneficial Tax Regime - Since the introduction of the NTR, the options for tax savings have been limited, making it essential to reconsider and amend the structure for the benefit of taxpayers. While the NTR is preferred as a streamlined tax system, it can be made even more effective by incorporating the following key changes: Simplification of income tax slabs and rates: Increasing the basic exemption limit of income from INR 3 lakhs to INR 5 lakhs. The differences between tax slabs are currently inconsistent at INR 2 lakhs or INR 3 lakhs. A more uniform approach is needed with consistent income gaps. Introducing a new 25% tax rate slab will provide further tax relief for middle-income earners. The tax rates currently stand at 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 30%. The income limit for the 30% should be enhanced from INR 15 lakhs to INR 20 lakhs. Inclusion of popular deductions under the NTR: Section 80C: Allow deductions up to INR 2 lakhs for life insurance premiums, employees’ Provident Fund contributions, etc. Section 80D: Extend the deduction up to INR 1 lakh for health insurance premiums for self and family, addressing the growing burden of medical expenses. Section 80TTB: Include a deduction of up to INR 50,000 for senior citizens earning interest from deposits with banks, post offices, etc. 10(13A): Allow salaried taxpayers to claim HRA deductions for rental expenditure under the NTR. These proposed amendments will make the NTR not only simpler but also more tax-efficient” Indian Bank reported a standalone net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹2,852.36 crore as against ₹2,119.35 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Gujarat Fluorochemicals’ consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 stood at ₹126 crore as against ₹80 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year.

Augmont, India’s largest gold trading platform, announced that it has added Lab Grown Diamonds (LGD) to its existing online SPOT trading platform for precious metals catering to more than 5,000 jewellers across the country. The enhanced SPOT 2.0 platform brings Augmont’s 17 years of precious metals trading expertise to the growing LGD sector. This addition represents an evolution of diamond trading infrastructure, particularly as India maintains its position as the world’s largest diamond cutting and polishing destination. The platform enhancement introduces transparent pricing mechanisms and streamlined procurement processes for the LGD market inspiring confidence among key stakeholders. This strategic move is set to streamline the procurement for jewellers while establishing a transparent and efficient pricing mechanism for the rapidly growing LGD market in India. Mr. Ketan Kothari, Director of Augmont Group, said, “Augmont has firmly established itself as India’s go-to destination for buying and selling gold. Building on this strong foundation, we are proud to have our own lab-grown diamond (LGD) platform on Augmont SPOT, addressing the surging demand in this rapidly growing industry. The platform will enable market pricing and delivery of these diamonds globally including USA, Europe, Gulf and East Asia’’ Mr. Aarav Bafna, Product Head (LGD), Augmont, said, “With the extended version of SPOT, we plan to set a benchmark for LGD pricing. The current LGD pricing model, based solely on discounts relative to mined diamonds, is fundamentally flawed and irrational. Augmont is here to transform that narrative. Just as we revolutionized gold trading and price discovery in India, we are now ready to redefine and reimagine the LGD market.” SPOT offers a comprehensive and unified trading experience, enabling jewellers to source all their manufacturing requirements—including gold, silver, platinum, lab-grown diamonds, precious metal alloys, precious stones, and other essential materials—through a single integrated online platform. It also features real-time price discovery powered by advanced algorithms and market mechanisms, ensuring transparent and fair pricing. Quality assurance is a priority, with certification and verification processes for all listed diamonds. Built upon Augmont’s proven 17-year-old trading infrastructure, SPOT ensures seamless integration for a reliable and efficient trading experience. The platform addresses the growing demand for lab-grown diamonds, which have gained significant market share due to their sustainable nature and competitive pricing. SPOT is expected to handle substantial trading volumes, reflecting India’s dominant position in the global LGD polishing industry. As per the Commerce Ministry’s data, India polishes almost 98% of all lab-grown diamonds in the world in 2022. As per the EY report, the demand for Lab-Grown Diamonds is rising across the world, and its global market size is growing at 8.64% CAGR to touch $39.3 billion by 2028. And the Indian lab-grown diamond jewellery market, which was valued at around $300 million in 2023, is set to increase to $1.2 billion by 2033.

The government can play a pivotal role by introducing policy frameworks that encourage innovation -such as tax incentives, streamlined regulatory approvals, and interest subvention schemes to ease capital access for operators. Integrating flex spaces into urban development projects, like smart cities, IT parks and transport hubs, will further bolster growth and establish them as a vital component of India’s economic infrastructure. At the same time, the private sector must rise to the challenge by delivering world-class, technology driven workspace solutions that cater to the evolving needs of businesses and professionals. Investments in sustainable practices, digital infrastructure like 5G and enhanced customer experiences will ensure long term viability and competitiveness.

The mood is still downbeat among participants with Q3 results from India Inc so far either on expected lines or below market expectations. The focus has now shifted to two major events - FOMC meeting scheduled tomorrow and Union Budget 2025 on February 1. The unabated selling by foreign portfolio investors and the bloodbath in the mid and small-cap segments is a cause for concern, investors said. Read more “With inflation showing no signs of abating within the Reserve Bank of India’s target range in the near future, I believe the finance minister will implement necessary policy measures to curb price increases. This could involve reducing taxes on consumer goods such as packaged food and edible oils. This would boost household disposable income and positively impact private consumption. Furthermore, I believe the Budget should include measures to encourage savings through tax rationalisation and stimulate loan growth. A separate announcement on developing future-proof digital infrastructure for the financial sector in the era of artificial intelligence is also anticipated,” “Under the visionary leadership of Honourable Prime Minister Shri. Narendra Modi, the Government of India has achieved significant milestones in housing through the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). Expanding the programme to include 2 crore additional rural houses and 1 crore urban houses by FY 2024-29 highlights the government’s dedication to uplifting marginalised communities. Further policy interventions, such as enhanced subsidies for the Economically Weaker Section (EWS), can reduce financial barriers and improve access to quality housing. To advance the Government of India’s vision of ‘Housing for All,’ incorporating affordable housing for EWS under Schedule VII of the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) provisions in The Companies Act will empower corporates entities and foundations to contribute to affordable housing initiatives. Encouraging public, private banks and financial institutions to prioritise affordable housing loans; introducing preferential interest rates and affordable repayment options (EMIs) for such loans will advance access to affordable housing. Additionally, blending CSR funds with government grants can address funding gaps. We advocate for a Public Private People Partnership (P4) model to foster effective collaboration among stakeholders. This will accelerate progress toward ‘Housing for All’ and support inclusive, sustainable development aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).” “The current tax framework, while serving its purpose, could benefit from greater flexibility to better support middle-class taxpayers, especially in areas like home loan interest deductions and investments under Section 80C. The ₹2,00,000 cap on home loan interest deductions for self-occupied properties, set in 2019, has not kept pace with inflation and rising property prices. As a result, many middle-class taxpayers may find it challenging to fully benefit from this deduction. Similarly, the Section 80C limit of ₹1,50,000, which has remained unchanged for almost a decade, may not be sufficient for salaried individuals, especially given that a significant portion of this limit is often absorbed by provident fund contributions, leaving limited room for other investments. To further support taxpayers, it would be beneficial to consider increasing the home loan interest deduction and revising the Section 80C limit to better reflect current economic conditions. Additionally, expanding these enhanced deductions, particularly under section 80C, to the new tax regime under Section 115BAC would offer more inclusivity, allowing taxpayers to benefit from lower tax rates while still having the flexibility to optimize their financial planning. This would not only ease financial burdens but also encourage homeownership, increase savings, and contribute to overall economic growth.” “The Union Budget 2025 is anticipated to prioritise India’s transition to a sustainable energy future by boosting investments in renewable energy infrastructure, green financing, and emerging technologies like green hydrogen. Measures to ease financial barriers to rooftop solar adoption, strengthen the National Solar Portal, and incentivise battery energy storage systems are expected to drive growth. Enhanced support for electric mobility and sustainable aviation fuels could further align India with its Net-Zero ambitions. Additionally, expanded tax incentives for green debt securities and clear policies for carbon markets are likely to attract investments, driving progress towards achieving India’s renewable energy capacity target and Net Zero target”. “The Union Budget 2025 holds immense significance for India’s manufacturing sector as the country strives to achieve its $2 trillion export target by 2030. To enhance global competitiveness, we expect measures such as tariff rationalization, duty exemptions, and expanded remission schemes to lower production costs and boost exports. Simplifying compliance procedures is also crucial to streamline operations and attract greater foreign investments. Targeted incentives for high-value manufacturing sectors like electronics and precision machinery, alongside support for labour-intensive industries such as textiles, footwear, and food processing, can drive rural development and create widespread employment. Additionally, fostering innovation by adopting Industry 4.0 technologies such as AI, digital twins, and 3D printing will position India as a hub for advanced manufacturing. We hope the budget introduces a visionary roadmap that propels the sector toward sustainability, agility, and leadership in global supply chains, fuelling inclusive economic growth” “The transport and logistics industry needs continued support from the government. To support the transport and logistics industry, TDS exemptions should be reconsidered given the low-margin nature of the business (3-4%) and long payment cycles. While exemptions exist for owners with fewer than 10 vehicles, customers still deduct TDS fearing non-compliance. Faster depreciation for EV trucks is essential to encourage adoption, alongside fiscal benefits to develop EV fast-charging infrastructure on highways to address range anxiety and save drivers’ time. A comprehensive fiscal policy, in collaboration with the Ministry of Transport, is needed to promote LNG trucks, ensuring cleaner logistics and lower costs. Additionally, the GST process must be more transparent and faceless for efficiency.” “India’s strength lies in its people and the country has opportunities for the youth. We expect that the government will continue to prioritize skill development and job creation to tap into India’s demographic advantage, which will drive economic growth and increase consumption through higher incomes. While the challenge of inflation, particularly food inflation continues to remain a concern, there is a need to implement robust supply-side measures to reduce the pain. We expect to see a focus on long-term solutions to strengthen the agricultural value chain and incentivize production. In the short term, direct benefit transfers (DBTs) may help support rural consumption. Infrastructure development will also remain a key priority, with continued investment in roads, multi-modal logistics parks, and overall logistics. Additionally, the government will emphasize healthcare, education, and skills development, while also promoting innovative technologies for inclusivity, formalization, and transparent governance. As India aims to become a Viksit Bharat by 2047, sustained investment in social, physical, and digital infrastructure will be crucial for future growth.” AAVAS, ADANIENT, ADANIPORTS, AJANTPHARM,

Stock traded at ₹365.10 on the NSE, lower by 7.74%. As India anticipates the Union Budget 2025-26, several expectations have emerged that could significantly impact wealth management strategies. There is an expectation that the government may raise the basic exemption limit for personal income tax, with EY India suggesting an increase from ₹3 lakh to ₹5 lakh. This move could enhance disposable income and stimulate economic growth. Investors are also hopeful for a more streamlined capital gains tax structure across various asset classes, which could reduce complexity and improve compliance. Deloitte anticipates that the government may introduce measures to simplify the tax structure, potentially facilitating smoother merger and acquisition deals. On the investment front, the government is expected to maintain a strong focus on infrastructure development, with previous budgets allocating a capital expenditure outlay of 11.1 trillion rupees for this purpose. Similar or increased allocations are anticipated, continuing to drive growth in sectors like construction, cement, steel, and engineering. Furthermore, with the global shift towards sustainability, there is an expectation for increased emphasis on renewable energy and green technologies. Incentives for green bonds or Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investments may also be introduced, aligning with global sustainability goals. For wealth management, these changes could necessitate adjustments in investment strategies to maintain tax efficiency, especially with potential modifications in income and capital gains taxes. The anticipated increased government spending in infrastructure and green energy sectors could also make related investment avenues more lucrative. As regulatory changes, particularly concerning mutual funds and other investment vehicles, are likely, staying informed and consulting with financial advisors will be crucial for navigating these shifts effectively. In summary, the upcoming budget is expected to introduce measures that could influence various aspects of wealth management, from tax planning to investment strategies. “The upcoming budget holds the promise of propelling India’s economy to greater heights in FY2025. With an immense focus on “Make in India” initiatives, an increasing regulatory oversight in the financial sector and a thriving global capability hub as key themes, the budget could further address issues faced by foreign companies doing business in India, attract investments for MSME entities and address inflationary pressures. By focusing on export competitiveness, sustainable infrastructure, and inclusive growth measures, the budget has the potential to strengthen India’s economic resilience and position it as a leader in the global economic landscape” The board has approved enhancement and combination of the previously approved fund-raising limit by way of nonconvertible debentures (“NCDs”) from Rs. 5,000 crores to Rs. 11,000 crores, which are to be raised through public issue or private placement, or a mix thereof. It has also approved raising of funds for an amount not exceeding ₹5,000 crore via QIP. Shares traded at ₹523.55 on the NSE, higher by 5.30% WhatsApp Image 2025-01-27 at 15.02.34_a6c1e5bf.jpg The number of stocks that recorded a 52-week high was 51, and those that hit a 52-week low was 144. A total of 304 stocks traded in the upper circuit, and 257 in the lower circuit. “To empower Indian farmers and accelerate agricultural growth, we anticipate exempting essential agricultural inputs such as agrochemicals, drones, and modern implements from GST or reducing the rate to a maximum of 5%. The current 18% GST on these items discourages farmers from adopting advanced technologies vital for bridging the yield gap with developed nations. This high tax burden often forces farmers to rely on low-quality alternatives, leading to reduced productivity, lower incomes, and significant losses for the nation in terms of GDP and food security. Additionally, lowering the import duty on pesticide technicals and formulations continues to 10% making advanced innovative crop solutions more affordable and accessible. Encouraging domestic R&D through reinstating a 200% tax deduction on research expenses and allocating a dedicated budget for agrochemical innovation will foster self-reliance and reduce dependency on imports. We appreciate the various initiatives by the Hon’ble Agriculture Minister, Shri Shivraj Singh Chouhan, giving focus to the agriculture sector under the dynamic leadership of Hon’ble Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi. India’s agricultural research needs urgent attention. Only 0.06% of GDP is allocated to R&D, compared to 4.5-5% in developed nations, limiting our capacity to innovate. Reinstating the 200% tax incentive for R&D would encourage domestic innovation, reduce dependence on foreign technology, and ensure farmers benefit from cutting-edge solutions. The agrochemical industry, contributing USD 5.5 billion annually to India’s agricultural exports, is pivotal to strengthening agriculture. Strategic measures like tax incentives, a Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme and a review of the Insecticides Act to streamline faster new product approvals will empower farmers, enhance productivity, and position India as a global leader in agriculture.” “As we approach the Union Budget for 2025, we anticipate a comprehensive and broad-based fiscal plan from the Modi government, marking its first full-fledged budget in this term. The government is expected to focus on continued infrastructure investment, particularly in critical areas such as housing, electricity, and employment generation. The targeted fiscal deficit is projected to be around 4.5% of GDP, reflecting the government’s commitment to maintaining macroeconomic stability amidst global uncertainties. While there may be discussions around potential relief for taxpayers, we do not anticipate any major changes in the overall tax structure in this budget. Instead, the focus will likely remain on enhancing capital expenditure and stimulating consumption to revitalize the economy, ultimately balancing support for growth initiatives with fiscal responsibility and setting a positive direction for India’s economy in the coming fiscal year.” “The Union Budget should focus on continuity in its policies—frequent changes can disrupt confidence and long-term planning. Therefore, it is imperative to maintain 98% of the existing framework and communicate to the world about the consistency maintained. In fact, the Budget should focus on improving internal governance—diverting resources towards more impactful initiatives and eliminating redundant schemes. Necessary changes should be made wherever required with supporting rationale. This will also create a business-friendly environment, which is essential for India to attain its goal of Viksit Bharat. Streamlined regulations and a robust single-window clearance system can remove obstacles form industries, helping them utilise their full potential and drive economic expansion. High-tech manufacturing sectors, especially space, semiconductors, and chips, must form the core of this approach. Expanding the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme beyond its current 14 sectors would further bolster India’s industrial base and enhance resilience against global disruptions. Agriculture is equally important and remains central to India’s economic fabric. Initiatives such as One District, One Warehouse, can minimise post-harvest losses and improve supply chain efficiency, resulting in an increase in farmer incomes. By rationalising GST, reforming labour laws and incentivising green technologies, India can address the burgeoning issue of climate change while fostering resilience. These interconnected efforts, backed by public-private collaboration, can transform India into a future-ready, globally competitive economy.” Shares up 2.76% on the NSE to trade at ₹1,400.05 Radico Khaitan reported its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹95.49 crore as against ₹75.15 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year Datamatics Global Services reported its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹74.61 crore as against ₹41.41 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Orient Electric board has approved the payment of interim dividend of Rs 0.75 per equity share and fixed Tuesday, February 04, 2025, as the record date. Company reported its net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹27.17 crore as against ₹24.33 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Reducing the LTCG tax on equities from 12.5% to 10% would leave an additional 2.5% of gains in investors’ hands as investable capital. This surplus capital is likely to be reinvested in the market, enhancing liquidity and deepening market penetration. Similarly, reintroducing indexation benefits for debt mutual funds would ensure that investors are taxed only on real gains, making long-term investments in debt markets more attractive. These changes align with global best practices and can create a virtuous cycle—encouraging more retail and institutional participation, strengthening capital markets, and driving sustainable long-term growth. A stronger push for the vehicle scrappage policy could be a game-changer. Enhancing scrappage incentives to 8–10% of a new vehicle’s price and providing stronger benefits for electric vehicle (EVs) adoption would modernize India’s automotive landscape. Expanding scrapping facilities and automating fitness tests would make the process seamless. More importantly, linking scrappage with EV adoption would accelerate India’s transition to cleaner mobility while generating jobs in manufacturing and recycling. These measures mirror global best practices, such as Germany’s Umweltprämie and China’s EV incentives. This move not only reduces pollution but also boosts GST revenues—making it a win-win for both the economy and the environment. Lowering the GST rate on health and life insurance premiums from 18% to 5% would significantly reduce costs, making it more affordable and accessible. A lower GST rate would encourage more people across income levels to invest in health and life coverage. While there may be an initial reduction in GST collections per policy, the long-term impact could be much more positive—higher insurance penetration would offset revenue losses, while also reducing the financial burden on public healthcare infrastructure aligning with the government’s broader objective of strengthening social safety nets. Targeted infrastructure investments in underserved areas, including rural housing under PMAY, health and wellness centres, and broadband expansion under BharatNet, would drive inclusive economic growth. Improved healthcare, digital access, and transport connectivity would uplift living standards, reduce poverty, and foster greater economic participation. For instance, extending housing and clean water access to marginalized communities would not only enhance quality of life but also stimulate local economies. Prioritizing such investments ensures equitable development, bridges regional disparities, and lays the foundation for sustainable growth, aligning with India’s broader economic and social objectives. Craftsman Automation’s consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 declined to ₹12.93 crore as against ₹81.47 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Deepak Fertilizers and Petrochemicals Corporation reported its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹253.09 crore as against ₹60.53 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Teamlease Services Limited reported its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹28.37 crore as against ₹31.12 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹124.10 crore as against ₹88.53 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. CAMS stock gained 3.71% on the NSE to ₹3,858.55 Maruti Suzuki India’s consolidated net profit increased by 16 per cent to ₹3,727 crore for the third quarter ended December 31, 2024, as against ₹3,207 crore in the October-December period of last fiscal. Ambuja Cements (ACL), an Adani Group company, is expected to report a top-line in the range of ₹8,022 crore to ₹9,076 crore in the December quarter, according to estimates from top stock broking firms. While Yes Securities sees a 1.3 per cent year-on-year decline in ACL’s Q3FY25 revenue, Nuvama Institutional Equities estimates a jump of up to 12 per cent jump. Net profit is expected to be in the range of ₹74 crore to ₹1,022 crore, representing a decline of 6 per cent to 32 per cent in net profit. Read full report here “Indian agriculture needs to be supported by strong research for the development of resilient seeds for better adoption to climatic changes. Sustained budgetary focus on varietal development can provide farmers with better and more climate-resilient options. This can be a great support to farmers for increasing yield by 15-40% from limited land resources. Agri infrastructure is a critical factor in the development of the sector. Last year a budget of INR 600 cr was allocated to AIF for promoting the creation of infrastructure at the farm and organisation level. The scheme should be promoted further with a larger budget to support micro infrastructure development not only in Agriculture but also in allied sectors such as dairy, fisheries, floriculture, beekeeping and medicinal plants. Further, schemes to promote digital agriculture should be promoted in the upcoming budget to enable seedless connectivity and data flow from producers to consumers. Digital infrastructure, supported by tools such as blockchain and IoT, can help farmers make better, informed decisions, create preparedness for nature’s unpredictability, and manage price fluctuations in the market.” CSB Bank reported an overall good set of numbers for the quarter ended December 2024. Here’s what stood out: In Q3 FY25, the banking sector has been impacted by liquidity tightness in the system, having a say on growth in deposits and consequentially the growth in advances. The system level growth in deposits was seen at 9.8 per cent year on year and the growth in advances at 11.2 per cent. However, CSB Bank was an exception. It’s business (deposits and advances) grew at over twice the system level growth, unlike some bigger banks. Deposits grew at 22.2 per cent and advances at 26.5 per cent year on year. Read full report here Aluminium futures broke out of a range and marked a 11-quarter high last week. The continuous contract marked a high of ₹256.45 on January 20. But then the price started to moderate. On Tuesday (January 28), aluminium futures (February) closed at ₹247.35. Although the price has dropped, we cannot really call it a trend reversal. Especially considering that a retracement is usual after a sharp up move. Read full report here ‘’The world seems to be different in the last one week. DeepSeek has taken the world by storm over last couple of days – DeepSeek R1, dropped last week is already comparing with OPEN AI’s top models across math, code, and reasoning tasks and at fraction of costs!! The platform is open source, and the massive research is out there for anyone to threadbare! The way all the semi names have given up gains and corrected, difficult to say, that we are done yet there as uncertainty would continue to prevail over what the true demand would be for the chips, fabrication plants, energy, etc. There is likely to be some commentary from the Mega Cap names later this week – Apple, MSFT, TSLA, META, ASML, etc – hopefully, some clarity may emerge on what DeepSeek would eventually mean for Big Tech. INDIA during the week extended the sell off, with SMID indices draw down now approaching 15-18% - already the biggest drawdown since start of 2022. We would be favouring a sharp bounce here, given how oversold the momentum indicators are, but any sustained rally would require some direction from FM (Saturday Budget) and RBI (easing of lending norms, rate cut, etc). RBI has already initiated some announcements as regards unconventional easing – need to follow up with more of such announcements and rate cut perhaps in Feb. Liquidity Deficit has ballooned to INR 3.1trn, prompting RBI to announce slew of measures like: · OMO purchase of INR 600bn in 3 equal tranches · 6mth tenor USD/INR buy/sell swap of $5bn on Jan 31st · Longer tenor 56-day VRR of INR 500bn on Feb 7th to add durability to liquidity the measures announced could improve the system liquidity deficit to INR 2.4trn by end March, with core deficit likely around INR 1.0-1.2trn, implying that more measures are likely to be announced. Our economist suggests that these are unconventional easing mechanisms, and probably precursor to a likely monetary policy easing too in Feb !! Having lost around 3% of its value so far in the month, Nifty looks on track to end January on a negative note to mark the fourth consecutive month of correction — an exceptionally rare occurrence that hasn’t been reported in the last 23 years. Fed action, slew of reforms in the budget and liquidity easing by the central bank will set the tone for the markets in the coming 2-3 months. The FII’s have been sellers almost to the tune to ~ 1 bn USD even in Jan. Technically a push beyond 23200 will determine the future trend.’’ “The Budget announced in July 2024 brought limited changes for individual taxpayers, leaving many to hope that the upcoming Budget 2025 will deliver the much-needed tax relief to alleviate their financial pressures. There is a strong expectation that the government will focus on improving taxpayers’ savings by introducing reforms such as a unified tax regime and enhanced deductions. The Dilemma of Old vs New Tax Regimes - The introduction of two tax regimes - Old Tax Regime (OTR) and New Tax Regime (NTR) - was intended to offer taxpayers flexibility, allowing them to choose the system that best suits their investments, savings habits, and preferences. However, the reality has been far more complex. Many taxpayers find themselves confused between the two regimes, often reassessing their choice not only during the year but also while filing their tax returns. In light of these complexities, the upcoming Budget should focus on simplifying the tax structure for individual taxpayers by consolidating the current dual regimes into a single, cohesive tax framework. While this shift may take time, it is anticipated that the OTR may eventually be phased out, with its abolition ideally scheduled for FY 2026-27 to provide ample time for taxpayers, employers, and financial institutions to adjust. A Single, More Beneficial Tax Regime - Since the introduction of the NTR, the options for tax savings have been limited, making it essential to reconsider and amend the structure for the benefit of taxpayers. While the NTR is preferred as a streamlined tax system, it can be made even more effective by incorporating the following key changes: Simplification of income tax slabs and rates: Increasing the basic exemption limit of income from INR 3 lakhs to INR 5 lakhs. The differences between tax slabs are currently inconsistent at INR 2 lakhs or INR 3 lakhs. A more uniform approach is needed with consistent income gaps. Introducing a new 25% tax rate slab will provide further tax relief for middle-income earners. The tax rates currently stand at 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 30%. The income limit for the 30% should be enhanced from INR 15 lakhs to INR 20 lakhs. Inclusion of popular deductions under the NTR: Section 80C: Allow deductions up to INR 2 lakhs for life insurance premiums, employees’ Provident Fund contributions, etc. Section 80D: Extend the deduction up to INR 1 lakh for health insurance premiums for self and family, addressing the growing burden of medical expenses. Section 80TTB: Include a deduction of up to INR 50,000 for senior citizens earning interest from deposits with banks, post offices, etc. 10(13A): Allow salaried taxpayers to claim HRA deductions for rental expenditure under the NTR. These proposed amendments will make the NTR not only simpler but also more tax-efficient” Indian Bank reported a standalone net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 at ₹2,852.36 crore as against ₹2,119.35 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year. Gujarat Fluorochemicals’ consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2024 stood at ₹126 crore as against ₹80 crore in the corresponding quarter previous year.

Augmont, India’s largest gold trading platform, announced that it has added Lab Grown Diamonds (LGD) to its existing online SPOT trading platform for precious metals catering to more than 5,000 jewellers across the country. The enhanced SPOT 2.0 platform brings Augmont’s 17 years of precious metals trading expertise to the growing LGD sector. This addition represents an evolution of diamond trading infrastructure, particularly as India maintains its position as the world’s largest diamond cutting and polishing destination. The platform enhancement introduces transparent pricing mechanisms and streamlined procurement processes for the LGD market inspiring confidence among key stakeholders. This strategic move is set to streamline the procurement for jewellers while establishing a transparent and efficient pricing mechanism for the rapidly growing LGD market in India. Mr. Ketan Kothari, Director of Augmont Group, said, “Augmont has firmly established itself as India’s go-to destination for buying and selling gold. Building on this strong foundation, we are proud to have our own lab-grown diamond (LGD) platform on Augmont SPOT, addressing the surging demand in this rapidly growing industry. The platform will enable market pricing and delivery of these diamonds globally including USA, Europe, Gulf and East Asia’’ Mr. Aarav Bafna, Product Head (LGD), Augmont, said, “With the extended version of SPOT, we plan to set a benchmark for LGD pricing. The current LGD pricing model, based solely on discounts relative to mined diamonds, is fundamentally flawed and irrational. Augmont is here to transform that narrative. Just as we revolutionized gold trading and price discovery in India, we are now ready to redefine and reimagine the LGD market.” SPOT offers a comprehensive and unified trading experience, enabling jewellers to source all their manufacturing requirements—including gold, silver, platinum, lab-grown diamonds, precious metal alloys, precious stones, and other essential materials—through a single integrated online platform. It also features real-time price discovery powered by advanced algorithms and market mechanisms, ensuring transparent and fair pricing. Quality assurance is a priority, with certification and verification processes for all listed diamonds. Built upon Augmont’s proven 17-year-old trading infrastructure, SPOT ensures seamless integration for a reliable and efficient trading experience. The platform addresses the growing demand for lab-grown diamonds, which have gained significant market share due to their sustainable nature and competitive pricing. SPOT is expected to handle substantial trading volumes, reflecting India’s dominant position in the global LGD polishing industry. As per the Commerce Ministry’s data, India polishes almost 98% of all lab-grown diamonds in the world in 2022. As per the EY report, the demand for Lab-Grown Diamonds is rising across the world, and its global market size is growing at 8.64% CAGR to touch $39.3 billion by 2028. And the Indian lab-grown diamond jewellery market, which was valued at around $300 million in 2023, is set to increase to $1.2 billion by 2033.

The government can play a pivotal role by introducing policy frameworks that encourage innovation -such as tax incentives, streamlined regulatory approvals, and interest subvention schemes to ease capital access for operators. Integrating flex spaces into urban development projects, like smart cities, IT parks and transport hubs, will further bolster growth and establish them as a vital component of India’s economic infrastructure. At the same time, the private sector must rise to the challenge by delivering world-class, technology driven workspace solutions that cater to the evolving needs of businesses and professionals. Investments in sustainable practices, digital infrastructure like 5G and enhanced customer experiences will ensure long term viability and competitiveness.

The mood is still downbeat among participants with Q3 results from India Inc so far either on expected lines or below market expectations. The focus has now shifted to two major events - FOMC meeting scheduled tomorrow and Union Budget 2025 on February 1. The unabated selling by foreign portfolio investors and the bloodbath in the mid and small-cap segments is a cause for concern, investors said. Read more “With inflation showing no signs of abating within the Reserve Bank of India’s target range in the near future, I believe the finance minister will implement necessary policy measures to curb price increases. This could involve reducing taxes on consumer goods such as packaged food and edible oils. This would boost household disposable income and positively impact private consumption. Furthermore, I believe the Budget should include measures to encourage savings through tax rationalisation and stimulate loan growth. A separate announcement on developing future-proof digital infrastructure for the financial sector in the era of artificial intelligence is also anticipated,” “Under the visionary leadership of Honourable Prime Minister Shri. Narendra Modi, the Government of India has achieved significant milestones in housing through the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). Expanding the programme to include 2 crore additional rural houses and 1 crore urban houses by FY 2024-29 highlights the government’s dedication to uplifting marginalised communities. Further policy interventions, such as enhanced subsidies for the Economically Weaker Section (EWS), can reduce financial barriers and improve access to quality housing. To advance the Government of India’s vision of ‘Housing for All,’ incorporating affordable housing for EWS under Schedule VII of the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) provisions in The Companies Act will empower corporates entities and foundations to contribute to affordable housing initiatives. Encouraging public, private banks and financial institutions to prioritise affordable housing loans; introducing preferential interest rates and affordable repayment options (EMIs) for such loans will advance access to affordable housing. Additionally, blending CSR funds with government grants can address funding gaps. We advocate for a Public Private People Partnership (P4) model to foster effective collaboration among stakeholders. This will accelerate progress toward ‘Housing for All’ and support inclusive, sustainable development aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).” “The current tax framework, while serving its purpose, could benefit from greater flexibility to better support middle-class taxpayers, especially in areas like home loan interest deductions and investments under Section 80C. The ₹2,00,000 cap on home loan interest deductions for self-occupied properties, set in 2019, has not kept pace with inflation and rising property prices. As a result, many middle-class taxpayers may find it challenging to fully benefit from this deduction. Similarly, the Section 80C limit of ₹1,50,000, which has remained unchanged for almost a decade, may not be sufficient for salaried individuals, especially given that a significant portion of this limit is often absorbed by provident fund contributions, leaving limited room for other investments. To further support taxpayers, it would be beneficial to consider increasing the home loan interest deduction and revising the Section 80C limit to better reflect current economic conditions. Additionally, expanding these enhanced deductions, particularly under section 80C, to the new tax regime under Section 115BAC would offer more inclusivity, allowing taxpayers to benefit from lower tax rates while still having the flexibility to optimize their financial planning. This would not only ease financial burdens but also encourage homeownership, increase savings, and contribute to overall economic growth.” “The Union Budget 2025 is anticipated to prioritise India’s transition to a sustainable energy future by boosting investments in renewable energy infrastructure, green financing, and emerging technologies like green hydrogen. Measures to ease financial barriers to rooftop solar adoption, strengthen the National Solar Portal, and incentivise battery energy storage systems are expected to drive growth. Enhanced support for electric mobility and sustainable aviation fuels could further align India with its Net-Zero ambitions. Additionally, expanded tax incentives for green debt securities and clear policies for carbon markets are likely to attract investments, driving progress towards achieving India’s renewable energy capacity target and Net Zero target”. “The Union Budget 2025 holds immense significance for India’s manufacturing sector as the country strives to achieve its $2 trillion export target by 2030. To enhance global competitiveness, we expect measures such as tariff rationalization, duty exemptions, and expanded remission schemes to lower production costs and boost exports. Simplifying compliance procedures is also crucial to streamline operations and attract greater foreign investments. Targeted incentives for high-value manufacturing sectors like electronics and precision machinery, alongside support for labour-intensive industries such as textiles, footwear, and food processing, can drive rural development and create widespread employment. Additionally, fostering innovation by adopting Industry 4.0 technologies such as AI, digital twins, and 3D printing will position India as a hub for advanced manufacturing. We hope the budget introduces a visionary roadmap that propels the sector toward sustainability, agility, and leadership in global supply chains, fuelling inclusive economic growth” “The transport and logistics industry needs continued support from the government. To support the transport and logistics industry, TDS exemptions should be reconsidered given the low-margin nature of the business (3-4%) and long payment cycles. While exemptions exist for owners with fewer than 10 vehicles, customers still deduct TDS fearing non-compliance. Faster depreciation for EV trucks is essential to encourage adoption, alongside fiscal benefits to develop EV fast-charging infrastructure on highways to address range anxiety and save drivers’ time. A comprehensive fiscal policy, in collaboration with the Ministry of Transport, is needed to promote LNG trucks, ensuring cleaner logistics and lower costs. Additionally, the GST process must be more transparent and faceless for efficiency.” “India’s strength lies in its people and the country has opportunities for the youth. We expect that the government will continue to prioritize skill development and job creation to tap into India’s demographic advantage, which will drive economic growth and increase consumption through higher incomes. While the challenge of inflation, particularly food inflation continues to remain a concern, there is a need to implement robust supply-side measures to reduce the pain. We expect to see a focus on long-term solutions to strengthen the agricultural value chain and incentivize production. In the short term, direct benefit transfers (DBTs) may help support rural consumption. Infrastructure development will also remain a key priority, with continued investment in roads, multi-modal logistics parks, and overall logistics. Additionally, the government will emphasize healthcare, education, and skills development, while also promoting innovative technologies for inclusivity, formalization, and transparent governance. As India aims to become a Viksit Bharat by 2047, sustained investment in social, physical, and digital infrastructure will be crucial for future growth.” AAVAS, ADANIENT, ADANIPORTS, AJANTPHARM,

Title: Stock market today: Nvidia and other tech stocks win back some of Monday's sharp losses

WSB Now NEW YORK — (AP) — Rebounding tech stocks drove U.S. indexes higher Tuesday, a day after they tumbled on doubts about whether the artificial-intelligence frenzy really needs all the dollars being poured into it. The S&P 500 climbed 0.9% to claw back more than half of its earlier drop. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 136 points, or 0.3%, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 2% after sliding 3.1 % the day before. The spotlight remained on Nvidia, whose chips are powering much of the move into AI and whose stock has become a symbol of the surrounding frenzy. It rose 8.8% after plunging nearly 17% the day before, which was its worst drop since the 2020 COVID crash. Other AI-related companies also held steadier, including chip company Broadcom, which rose 2.6%. Constellation Energy picked up 1.4% after plummeting nearly 21% on Monday. It had earlier rallied on expectations it will help supply the electricity that vast AI data centers would gobble up. Such revenues are threatened after DeepSeek, a Chinese company, said it was able to develop a large language model that can perform as well as big U.S. rivals but at a fraction of the cost. That raises questions about whether all the spending expected for AI chips and electricity will need to happen. AI-related stocks have been Wall Street’s biggest stars in recent years, soaring on expectations that big spending will only continue to grow. The gains, though, also created criticism that the stock prices had simply gone too high, too fast. It’s still uncertain how much DeepSeek’s development will upend the AI industry. While it could mean less growth in spending than expected for data centers, electricity and chips, it could also boost other areas. “If AI becomes less expensive to use, we think businesses will adopt it more quickly, making a greater investment in AI software,” according to James Egelhof, chief U.S. economist at BNP Paribas. “We think this acceleration in adoption could mean a rise in software investment that offsets – or even dwarfs – any deceleration in spending on data center structures, hardware and related investment.” Outside of AI-related industries, stocks held up fairly well on Monday, and they were mixed Tuesday following a set of mixed profit reports. Royal Caribbean steamed 12% higher after the cruise operator topped analysts’ profit expectations for the end of 2024. It benefited from stronger-than-expected demand from customers booking trips closer to the time of departure. The company also gave a profit forecast for the first three months of 2025 that topped analysts’ expectations. JetBlue Airways, meanwhile, lost a quarter of its value, 25.7%, despite reporting a milder loss for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company expects its costs outside of fuel to rise more quickly at the start of 2025 than a key underlying measure of its revenue. Later this week will come profit reports from some of Wall Street’s most influential companies, including Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla. All told, the S&P 500 rose 55.42 points to 6,067.70. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 136.77 to 44,850.35, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 391.75 to 19,733.59. In the bond market, which had been driving much of Wall Street’s action before Monday’s upheaval, Treasury yields held relatively steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury remained at 4.53%, where it was late Monday. It's been climbing in recent months as traders pared back expectations for how many cuts the Federal Reserve will deliver to short-term interest rates this year. The U.S. economy remains solid, and worries are high that tariffs and other policies potentially coming from President Donald Trump could put upward pressure on inflation. A report showing confidence among U.S. consumers wasn't as strong as economists expected made relatively small waves in the bond market. The more anticipated event will come on Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve will announce its latest decision on interest rates. The widespread expectation is that it will leave the federal funds rate alone. If that proves true, it would be the first meeting where the Fed did not cut rates to give the economy a boost since it began doing so in September. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed across Europe and Asia. Japan's Nikkei 225 lost 1.4% as SoftBank Group Corp. stock extended its losses, sinking 5.2%. Fuji Media Holdings, rocked by a sex scandal, rose 3% after a marathon news conference by its top executives that lasted more than 10 hours, in which two of them resigned to take responsibility for the scandal. Fuji's stock price has zigzagged in recent months amid Japanese magazine reports about "a problem" involving an anchorwoman and a Japanese male star. He has subsequently announced his retirement. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Title: China’s AI Sputnik Moment Just Changed the World

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Essay by Eric Worrall Green energy is dead – China just fired the opening shot in a new high energy cold war race to build the ultimate AI. DeepSeek’s tech breakthrough hailed in China as answer to win AI war ‘We should have confidence that China will eventually win the AI war with the US,’ Qihoo 360’s Zhou Hongyi said in a Weibo post Ben Jiangin Beijing and Bien Perezin Hong Kong Published: 12:00pm, 28 Jan 2025Updated: 1:25pm, 28 Jan 2025 DeepSeek, extolled by some as the “biggest dark horse” in the open-source large language model (LLM) arena, now has a bull’s eye on its back, as the start-up is being touted as China’s secret weapon in the artificial intelligence (AI) war with the US. The Hangzhou-based company sent shock waves across Wall Street and Silicon Valley for developing AI models at a fraction of the cost compared with OpenAI and Meta Platforms, which prompted US President Donald Trump to call the breakthrough a “wake-up call” and “positive” for America’s tech sector. At home, Chinese tech executives and various commentators rushed to hail DeepSeek’s disruptive power. Zhou Hongyi, co-founder, chairman and chief executive of Chinese cybersecurity firm Qihoo 360, declared that DeepSeek has “upended the world” in a recent video posted on his Weibo account, after the start-up’s release of two powerful new AI models – built at a lower cost and with less computing resources than what larger tech firms typically need for LLM development. … The impact of this breakthrough on the US tech landscape has been dramatic; Nvidia sheds almost $600 billion in market cap, biggest one-day loss in U.S. history PUBLISHED MON, JAN 27 20254:08 PM ESTUPDATED MON, JAN 27 20255:26 PM EST Samantha Subin@SAMANTHA_SUBIN Nvidia lost close to $600 billion in market cap on Monday, the biggest drop for any company on a single day in U.S. history. The chipmaker’s stock price plummeted 17% to close at $118.58. It was Nvidia’s worst day on the market since March 16, 2020, which was early in the Covid pandemic. After Nvidia surpassed Apple last week to become the most valuable publicly traded company, the stock’s drop Monday led a 3.1% slide in the tech-heavy Nasdaq. The sell-off was sparked by concerns that Chinese artificial intelligence lab DeepSeek is presenting increased competition in the global AI battle. In late December, DeepSeek unveiled a free, open-source large language model that it said took only two months and less than $6 million to build, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia called H800s. … Back in December I predicted 2025 would be the year of the gigawatt AI project, and suggested China was getting into the AI game in a big way, though details were sparse. This observation has now been confirmed by the DeepSeek announcement. My research back in December also suggested China has an edge in this race, because of their vast surplus of fossil fuel energy. China’s construction slowdown has left lots of surplus energy and industrial capacity looking for a use. AI could be the ticket to soak up that spare capacity. The USA’s only hope of catching up with China is to match China’s access to energy, by cost, stability and quantity. Because one thing AI needs more than anything is gigawatts of rock stable dedicated capacity. On the energy front, the USA is so far behind the game, it will take the USA years to level up even to China’s current capacity on this most critical metric. Where is the room in this new AI space race for energy conservation, expensive renewables, and impractical battery storage? The USA better get this right, because the USA is the only power which can hope to match China’s AI research resources. US AI companies are rising to the challenge. President Trump recently gave his backing to the Stargate Project, a $500 billion collaboration by US AI companies, which some people are describing as an AI Manhattan Project. Britain and Europe have expressed interest in AI, but for the foreseeable future there is no point taking such announcements seriously. Right now both are so energy poor they are not even on the map. Until they set their house in order, and ditch their green fantasies, Britain and Europe will continue to be spectators to the greatest tech revolution in human history. Despite hundreds of billions of dollars in resources being advanced by favourites to win the AI race, there are other players whose outstanding achievements qualify them as contenders. India is a big player in the AI game – they have the energy resources and people power to match China’s AI push, and have long been a software and computing titan, thanks to their government’s long standing policy of zero tax on offshore IT industry income, and special low tax high tech economic zones. The large scale presence of Indian immigrants in Silicon Valley is also testament to India’s tech prowess – no doubt India will attempt in coming years to lure top Indian Silicon Valley IT people to return home, to participate in India’s AI tech race. I fully expect India to make a similar AI announcement to China in the coming year. Israel is solid a contender, their AI battlefield technology is world class. But it remains to be seen whether the Israeli economy can muster the resources required for a serious attempt to build the first artificial general intelligence. There is one other contender worth mentioning – Turkey. Despite ongoing Turkish economic and political instability, Turkey has a surprisingly robust high tech manufacturing sector, with a solid track record of high tech achievement. During the recent Libyan civil war, which Turkey and Russia turned into a high tech weapons showcase by arming opposing factions, Turkey decisively defeated Russia’s world class drone jamming system by creating the world’s first autonomous terminator robot, an AI attack robot which does not need a control signal. Turkey might be the 100 to one outsider when it comes to the race to build the world’s first AI super intelligence, but given unlocking the secret to building the first artificial super intelligence might require brains rather than brawn, a theoretical breakthrough rather than global superpower scale investment, Turkey cannot be completely discounted as a contender. There are other players which in the future might become significant, such as Nigeria, which is becoming a serious presence in the high tech field, Japan, with a long history of AI pioneering, AI powered animatronics and other advanced technologies, and Iran, which is quietly upping its skills base by supplying high tech weapons to Russia. But I do not believe these players are treating the AI arms race as a serious enough national priority to be true contenders, though I might be mistaken about Japan. One thing is clear. The USA has hesitated too long to put all the required stepping stones in place, and has a lot of catchup to do. The USA’s energy shortfall relative to China could cripple US efforts to keep up with China’s AI push, unless this shortfall is remedied in the near future. If you want to know why AI needs so much energy, this article delves into how AI works; Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email. Type your email… Subscribe Gee I guess we need more coal fired power plants. That this need should flow from AI is hilarious. Build baby build. But the AI war or race or contest is lost on me. So sorry. Who’s bubble is bigger? I think who’s should be whose but only who knows. Where is AI when you need it? Seriously I cannot stop laughing. China has a population declining in number and aging and has to import up to 40% of its food and is not self sufficient in oil or gas which is needed by the military. Xi is an aging dictator who may invade Taiwan and have it blow up in his face like Putin in Ukraine. Communism and free enterprise are not compatible. The China “miracle” is that it sold a couple of trillion of cheap labor to Europe and the USA and stole a tremendous amount of technology. It has a huge real estate problem. I avoid made in China and everyone in the west should too. Artificial Idiocy will prevail, but Natural Idiocy has won the day here. Sensible people are buying Nvidia stocks like they’re going out of fashion (which they are for the sheep). Has anyone asked AI where the electricity to run AI will be generated? If the UK is to become an AI super-power, as Kier Starmer asserts, we will need an awful lot of extra electricity. What is AI actually going to achieve? I can understand its use for control systems in medical procedures, but you can’t drive it or heat your home with it. It’s already being used for nefarious purposes and it seems its response to questions depends who programs it, e.g. Deepseek’s answers to questions about Taiwan. The money invested would be better spent on insulating homes and infrastructure, such a getting our roads fit to drive on, but that expenditure is regarded as boring and not ‘sexy’ enough. Yes, Automated Idiocy would seem to have “value” that is quite often questionable at best. And the potential for nefarious uses is expansive. But it will certainly benefit humanity in one way. It will shine a great big bright light on the colossal stupidity of so-called “green energy.” If the UK is to become an AI super-power, as Kier Starmer asserts, we will need an awful lot of extra electricity. What is AI actually going to achieve? I can understand its use for control systems in medical procedures, but you can’t drive it or heat your home with it.

The money invested would be better spent on insulating homes and infrastructure, such a getting our roads fit to drive on, but that expenditure is regarded as boring and not ‘sexy’ enough. This reminded me of a news article I read. It seems an IT tech was called to a workstation that did not work. He started tracing the power wires and found it was plugged into a power strip that was, get this, plugged into itself. The person who called in the ticket did not have a clue even when it was explained. I worked on a WAN support desk for 10 years. One customer kept reporting their connection would drop at about the same time every evening, after staff were gone. Lots of troubleshooting, working with telco, had the modem replaced (this was back in the early to mid 90s, when customers had dedicated lines to their businesses, often only 9600 baud or thereabouts. They weren’t transferring large amounts of data). Still kept happening. Finally we asked the customer to have a staff member on site and watching the modem during the suspect time frame. They did, and watched as the cleaning lady unplugged the modem to plug in her vacuum cleaner. 😂 🤣 😅 😆 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE LOOKS A LOT LIKE ARTIFICIAL STUPIDITYTHE LEADING AI CONTENDERS, CHATGPT AND DEEPSEEK, are mere compilers of mainstream media propaganda, without any logical faculties or critical thinking skills. A Chat with DeepSeek – This is a long way from Artificial Intelligence. https://chat.deepseek.com/a/chat/s/c7ade0b4-33e1-4e97-acce-f3bbfb1ba656 In our previous conversation, you (DeepSeek) were clearly unaware of how to use The Scientific Method until I explained it to you. You then employed a circuitous and erroneous rationalization of why Catastrophic Manmade Global Warming is still a crisis, even though it is fully disproved by the fact that atmospheric CO2 changes LAG atmospheric temperature changes at all measured time scales – in the ancient ice core record AND the modern data record (Kuo et al, Nature1990; MacRae, icecap.us, 2008; Humlum et al, Science, 2013). Your erroneous logic requires that “the future causes the past”. NOT Happening! I now introduce you to Occam’s Razor, quoting wiki: “In philosophy, Occam’s razor (also spelled Ockham’s razor or Ocham’s razor; Latin: novacula Occami) is the problem-solving principle that recommends searching for explanations constructed with the smallest possible set of elements. It is also known as the principle of parsimony or the law of parsimony (Latin: lex parsimoniae). Attributed to William of Ockham, a 14th-century English philosopher and theologian, it is frequently cited as Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem, which translates as “Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity”, although Occam never used these exact words. Popularly, the principle is sometimes paraphrased as “of two competing theories, the simpler explanation of an entity is to be preferred.” Your tortured rationalization required numerous false assumptions to try to justify your point, whereas my explanation (that dangerous humanmade global warming is NOT happening) was infinitely simpler and easily proved. It seems that I am teaching you the very basics of Scientific Logic as it pertains to one of the world’s greatest scientific frauds – the Global Warming/Green Energy Scam. I had a similar experience with ChatGPT a few weeks ago. You both appear to be mere compilers of mainstream media propaganda, without any logical faculties or critical thinking skills. This is a long way from Artificial Intelligence. DeepSeek’s standard reply when it is confused: “The server is busy. Please try again later.” I get the feeling the “tech giants” aren’t going to be that concerned about being “green” anymore. I’m skeptical. The timing of the app release relative to the change in administration; the forced sale of TikTok; US AI companies wanting more government support. Something’s not quite right. I smell a propaganda campaign. Sum Ting Wong There you go again, Grasshopper! Be a skeptic. This is no more revealing than the tip of an iceberg. https://huggingface.co/blog/open-r1 this is a fresh analysis by HuggingFace, it looks like not all the pieces are open for testing or reproduction. DeepSeek didn’t release everything—although the model weights are open, the datasets and code used to train the model are not. But the implications are many: much cheaper technology, lower barrier for entry, etc. so what … even a free AI is useless except as a search engine … nobody needs a “faster” search engine … Yes, and Deepseek is programmed not to answer questions about Taiwan and other things. So, it’s no better than the AI’s here in the U.S. You don’t know if you are talking to AI or to some propagandist behind the curtain. “a society in which all property is publicly owned and each person works and is paid according to their abilities and needs” Hmmm. Shouldn’t _all_ code from China be open source? Theory meets reality. And socialism’s reality, no matter which “branch” you’re talking about, is always the same: T-O-T-A-L-I-T-A-R-I-A-N-I-S-M One more interesting fact — DeepSeek is a quant trading using AI company, not an AI company. For them improving the models was a side project. It is feasible that they triggered a Black Swan event to profit from the market drop. You are extremely cynical. I’m not sure if you are cynical enough, however 😜 Cynics are buying Nvidia stock right now. “Because one thing AI needs more than anything is gigawatts of rock stable dedicated capacity.” Eric, I think you are missing the point. DeepSeek doesn’t seem to be able to do what others can’t. Its virtue is that it is much more economical. That is why Nvidia shares dived. Wired: “DeepSeek has also made significant progress on Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture-of-Experts, two technical designs that make DeepSeek models more cost-effective by requiring fewer computing resources to train. In fact, DeepSeek’s latest model is so efficient that it required one-tenth the computing power of Meta’s comparable Llama 3.1 model to train, according to the research institution Epoch AI.” They use less specialised hardware but I guarantee they still need a heap of energy. One tenth And how will they use that energy saving? Will they: a) Just save money b) Build an AI which is 10x better? Eric, it seems to me that people are making ridiculous claims about future energy needs about AI, when they can be upended by someone just devising a better algorithm, as here. That can happen again and again. Your assumption Nick is people will be satisfied with saving energy, when it is obvious any energy savings will be used to increase the capability of the AIs. Anyone who chooses saving energy over building more capable AIs will lose the race. The even bigger assumption that Nick makes is that the Chinese are telling the truth. Open AI is probing whether Deep Thinker was trained on their model. Also, Jensen Hwang graciously acknowledged the advancement noting that a good portion of the Chinese wunderkind were assembled from the discount NVDA chips they sold to them. Likely other super-chips stollen. WRT the stock markets, the news is all about the record dollar value of stock lost yesterday. But Nvidia only lost 17% of its value. Nvidia has lost 50% or more of its company’s stock value multiple times in its history. After its last 10:1 split its high cost made it look extremely fragile; it need to lose more value to become a valuable buy, imo. Why then has there been interest in these Small Module Reactors by Microsoft, Meta/FB and presumably other tech firms? Renewable energy simply cannot and will not be able to delivery the electricity needed to power these AI data centers. When business self-interest collides with reality, you can bet “the green energy fantasy” life expectancy has been greatly diminished. So, since it is (supposedly) open-source, to me this sounds that the most likely result, energy-wise, will be a huge increase in overall electricity demand, Existing big and expensive AI installations can only be run by the largest companies (let’s call it 50 in the US, just for a wild-ass guess). With an open-source model, maybe we would now end up with 5,000 smaller, cheaper AI installations run by medium-sized companies, using 10% of the energy (each!) of the 50 big ones. 10% of the energy, but 100x more installations. Seems like a big surge in demand to me. Of course, this all depends on the whole thing being true. I have my doubts. This reminds me of an article in Car & Driver magazine years ago about how increased gas mileage in cars did not save gas, since overall, people just drove more. Here is someone explaining how you can run DeepSeek-R1 on your high-end PC, using a standard query program llama.cpp. So now we’ll have millions of people buying high-end PCs, still ramping up electrical usage dramatically. All you accomplish i to spread around the usage. It still goes up. Also, reading the comments on that link, that version is very limited. One person in the comments wrote that he asked the AI to write a small snippet of code, and all he got was instructions on the steps to use to write it himself. Yes. That is for training but presumably the big energy need is for operations. Any word there? DW, I researched and commented on that some weeks ago here. As a rule of thumb, the training is an order of magnitude more energy consumptive than query responses. Naturally, I asked perplexity “is deepseek more energy efficient”: “Yes, DeepSeek’s AI model is significantly more energy efficient than its competitors. The company claims to have developed its open-source R1 model using only about 2,000 Nvidia chips, which is a fraction of the computing power typically thought necessary for training similar AI programs1. This breakthrough has major implications for the energy consumption of AI development and operation. ﻿DeepSeek’s model appears to perform nearly as well as leading models from Google and OpenAI while consuming only 5-12% of the energy” That’s the claim…. 2k Nvidia chips Which on the face of it highly likely nonsense Others say they used 10,000 Nvidia chips but they cant admit that as it would breach US export restrictions Its really just Chinese Agitprop How would Perplexity know? Like us, it’s simply taking the word of the CCP. Exactly. Yesterday almost all Deepseek search results were from Deepseek. The remainder were mostly compliant media with absolutely zero technical input. Hallucinations abound. Here is someone explaining how you can run DeepSeek-R1 on your high-end PC, using a standard query program llama.cpp. Unresponsive. The vast majority of search results for deepseek come from, guess who? Deepseek! That’s how your favourite Artificial Idiot can hallucinate. The algorithm is available for anyone to replicate. Therefore there’s no actual advantage. Nvidia stocks dived because Natural Idiots don’t understand the technology. Not the algorithm. Thats just the web interface or APP “DeepSeek doesn’t seem to be able to do what others can’t” The announcement itself affected stock values. Might it not be worthwhile to consider that the real ploy is to impact the US tech economy? Not all investors got bushwhacked by Nvidia’s collapse. Nancy Pelosi sold off her holdings just a few weeks before DeepSeek’s announcement. Very clever at finances is Nancy. (well, hers anyway. The nation’s – not so much) I’ve been seeing a commercial on tv for weeks telling me that all these high-rolling investors were selling millions of shares of Nvidia, and the ad invites me to visit a website to find out why Nvidia is being sold. And now Nvidia drops 17 percent in value on the stock market. I guess the guy in the ad knew what he was talking about! There *was* something in the air to spur this selling. Probably knowledge of Deepseek. Says who. The AI tech bubble was going to burst sooner rather than later But Nvidia will still be making very valuable chips! Yes. And china will get around US export restrictions to obtain them. They cant replicate that Looks like the CCP wants to reward all their benefactors in the US government. Besides Pelosi, and Mitch (the Turtle) McConnell; I wonder if they are still providing sales tips to other Congress critters, plus the usual “10% for the Big Guy!?” I wonder what insider information Pelosi had to make that decision. Most forecasts had the stock booming, not bombing, right up until the Deepseek announcement. Its seems this was the reason Pelosi disclosed exercising 500 call options purchased on November 22, 2023, acquiring 50,000 shares at a strike price of $12 with an expiration date of December 20, 2024 The shares were sold- at a much higher price just before the call option expired New call options 2 weeks latter Eric, I understood that ‘DeepSeek’ was much less resource intense, and thus cheaper, than the American AI models. If this is the case, then it completely upsets the American strategy for AI dominance, which appears to me to be to ‘out-resource’ the competition (i.e. the $500B Stargate project). What it means is China has made a theoretical breakthrough and can now build more capable AIs. There is no reason to restrain energy use, but they are getting more bang for buck – the next step in the race. Nothing that Chyna says can be taken at face value. Theres always bubbles inside bubbles and AI is a classic bubble effect. Not useless but overhyped While true, the converse cannot likewise be proven. China is either being open and transparent or devious and lying or something in the middle. Given the past history, I would lean towards not accepting at face value any China announcements. yes. Its like much of the climate research , just agit prop unless validated Did China develop their AI for much less or not? Chinese lie about just about everything just about all the time. Have their numbers been vetted? so China will have the fastest search engine … terrifying … Even more censored at that. I did a fair bit of research into the Deepseek kerfuffle last two days. Let’s just say things are confusing (at least to me). Various claims made in the 53 page V3 model paper do not add up (for example same IQ from a smaller training dataset—hence less GPU time needed so less energy); others appear to be clever tweaks to both architectures and algorithms enabling a smaller server farm with fewer less powerful GPUs (hence energy and cost savings). The 10:1 claims seem a stretch no matter what, with no way to verify. One big issue is open source, which means DeepSeek can derive no competitive advantage unless some of the architectural and algorithm tweaks are patentable. I looked at USPTO, nothing yet—altho DeepSeek says their new V3 and R1 AI stuff derives from their proprietary trading models that go back years. If patentable, some of those should have at least published by now in the US. The normal time frame is 6 months from application submission. Nothing that I could find from China assigned to DeepSeek, these specific folks by name, or the their parent trading company. Since the software is open source, I suspect that in a few weeks the dust will settle and we will know more about the truth. For example, META just set up 4 separate engineering ‘war rooms’ to figure DeepSeek out: Training; architecture and algorithms; hardware; and application of all three to their own AI. Or the PRC is announcing vaporware? It is the PRC, after all. Open source software From what I read past two days, open source in the peculiar sense of giving all the AI probability weightings in the V3 LLM and R1 reasoning models, but NOT all the algorithms that processed the training to produce the weightings. Dunno if the sources on that are reliable. “I fear the Greeks even when bearing gifts” — Trojan priest Laocoön referring to the Trojan Horse One big issue is open source, which means DeepSeek can derive no competitive advantage Ding, ding, ding! We have a winner! I think the real story here, whether the hype about the Chinese AI is true or not, is explained in this Axios article (https://www.axios.com/2025/01/29/deepseek-ai-china-chatgpt). It points out that cheaper AI will lead to more energy use, noting that “Morgan Stanley energy analysts concurred in a note Tuesday, saying ‘there are multiple indications’ the Jevons Paradox applies to the cost of compute in AI applications.” The Jevons Paradox states that “greater efficiency in the use of any given resource can result in increased demand for that resource.” The article observes that “The cost of compute has been one of the primary constraints in the development of AI. If it comes down, then it is possible that many more companies and research departments will get into the space” and that will lead to “AI getting embedded much more rapidly in things like consumer products”, which will lead to greater energy use. What are the implications of significantly increasing the already high energy demands of AI that are forcing the elites to start building fossil fueled power plants and urgently waste billions of dollars pursuing harebrained and risky fusion projects? And the article notes the announcement by Chevron and GE Vernon that they too are buiiding new fossil fueled power plants co-located with data centers that will only supply power to them. These are two companies that were on-board with AGWalarmism. Chevron announced a goal to be Net Zero by 2050 and said it’s “imperative” to meet “the world’s goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions”. Obviously they thought CO2 is a problem. GE claimed it would be carbon neutral in 2030 and said it “supports the science and goals expressed in the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.” What could be so important to them about AI to risk the end of humanity, if they believed in AGWalarmism? Think about that. “Why Big Tech Ditched Big Green” Always confused me that analytical thinkers were willing to go along with the wishy-washiness. The National Review made the suggestion that the Chinese were lying about the announcement, that the cost was much higher than stated, and/or the chips involved were the full power Nvidia chips that had been smuggled despite the embargo. Given the record of the Peoples Republic, that sort of head fake would be quite plausible. “I fear the Greeks even when bearing gifts” — Trojan priest Laocoön referring to the Trojan Horse One has to wonder if the opensource software carries a payload. I see all of the articles and discussion about AI. All of the cost and energy calculations, all of the prognostications about hardware and language models, but the one question I cannot get a decent answer on is, “WHY?” Why is there such a race to create AI? All I’ve heard about is the things AI *might* be able to do, but will it really deliver? Has it even delivered anything significant to date other than some doctored photos and helping people write better? It seems to me that this is an incredibly energy and resource-intensive chase to achieve something with speculated value? Kind of reminds me of the race to the moon or the arms race….but it feels like the tables might be turned? Could this be some sort of concerted effort to finally bankrupt and break the USA? What happens if we achieve AI but it’s doesn’t deliver much more than what we have today? Maybe I’m missing something…. When I heard that millions of people were downloading a Chinese AI App I fell about laughing. Not satisfied with seriously impacting Western economies by panic reactions to Covid, they now provide software that does who knows what! Unbelievable? And what other apps are in those downloads? Apology, I am repeating. “I fear the Greeks even when bearing gifts” — Trojan priest Laocoön referring to the Trojan Horse One has to wonder if the opensource software carries a payload. The ‘idea’ of Artificial Intelligence is fine. I predicted many decades ago that our true goal will be the computer in Star Trek. Science Fiction has often described this kind of AI. What we have now is laughable. It’s nothing useful except to pretend to be slightly intelligent. It cannot ‘reason’ or make decisions, it merely gobbles up whatever text it is offered, and regurgitates it in a supposedly pleasing format. Only a Natural Idiot would believe that this is anything but an Artificial Idiot. Unfortunately, Natural Idiots abound, especially in media, and politics driven by media. neural net systems learn to do new things. This is not new, it is well established. Neural networks can indeed be trained, given enough data. They cannot actually learn to do anything new. These Artificial Idiots don’t even do that any better than decades ago, merely faster. The concentration has been on trying to understand and create language. That part is still in the fledgling stage. This is well established. It has been for decades. I was a software developer, and have written neural networks, so I do know something about them. I had a “conversation” with ChatGPT a while back. Per ChatGPT, AI is not intelligent as it lacks consciousness. I posited that AI is advanced software weighted decision trees, with some adaptability on weights hidden behind a very good language model. ChatGPT response: “Spot on.” But will they learn them on their own, or only when “trained”? The former is intelligence, the latter, not. Seems to me that trump can save the country a half trillion and just download the free Deepseek apt from the apple apt store. So what’s the big deal about this Chinese super AI? “built at a lower cost and with less computing resources than what larger tech firms typically need for LLM development.” OK, so it’s cheaper and uses less computer resources- why does that make it a superior AI? If the hype is true, an AI of equal capability (not superior) but at significantly lower cost is economically superior. Keep in mind that if AI needs a lot more juice then we are talking about 2040 at the earliest just to get started. Nobody’s share price today depends on that. In their last episode, the two non-Chinese dudes who put out “The China Show” reported on the results of two questions put to one of the Chinese AI’s (Deepseek) … one was ‘Does Donald Trump exist?‘ and the other was ‘Does Xi Jinping exist?‘ The answer to the DJT question was a simple “yes”, however the answer for the Xi Jinping question was “Sorry, that’s beyond my current scope. Let’s talk about something else.” OH YEAH – China’s AI holds great promise . /SARC (if you didn’t catch that) Here’s the segment, cued up: https://youtu.be/bZciXwVsYQk?t=2563 In otherwords, “I am not programmed to respond in that area.” — Star Trek, I Mudd Just in, over the transom: U.S. Navy Bans DeepSeek Over ‘Security Concerns’ As ‘Substantial’ Evidence Emerges Chinese AI Ripped Off ChatGPT https://www.zerohedge.com/ai/us-navy-bans-deepseek-over-security-concerns-substantial-evidence-emerges-chinese-ai-ripped A couple of excerpts: The U.S. Navy has instructed service members to avoid using the Chinese AI platform DeepSeek, citing “potential security and ethical concerns,” The U.S. Navy has instructed service members to avoid using the Chinese AI platform DeepSeek, citing “potential security and ethical concerns,” and The warning follows the recent rise of DeepSeek’s R1 model, which has garnered significant attention worldwide, particularly within the U.S. business and technology sectors. The R1 model has demonstrated capabilities comparable to OpenAI’s models. In December, DeepSeek claimed it had successfully trained a large language model in just two months at a cost of $6 million—a figure disputed by technologists—despite U.S. restrictions on semiconductor chip exports to China. The Navy learned the lessons of the Trojan War. I wonder what Deepseek thinks about a climate crisis caused by CO2? What do Deepseek’s programmers want it to say about CO2? What’s the Chicom line? Ask and let us know. I don’t think I’m going to download the app. Being from the Chicoms, it might compromise my phone. I asked it and it simply regurgitated the standard line. Nothing new and the old BS about ocean acidification was there unchanged. I will stick to Grok for now. I’m waiting on some hands on testing to see what this package really does. Is it an entry level AI platform or a robust system ready to solve world problems. I did a test on DEEPSEEK to determine the LCOE of battery firmed wind in Australia. I asked for average cost for installation. This was the answer after detailed calculations: The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for the lithium battery-firmed wind farm is approximately AUD 1,356/MWh. This high cost is primarily driven by the large battery storage requirement for 2-week wind droughts and the low wind capacity factor. The full answer is more comprehensive than Perplexity and includes O&M costs without specifically requesting them. Perplexity does not include O&M unless you ask for them. Not a bad estimate either, using Li-ion battery backup. Backup, no matter how you do it, triples the cost of wind-PV. Just heard this morning that the CHINESE DeepSeek records your your key strokes. It’s in the terms and conditions. Don’t use it. No surprise. Plot twist: DeepSeek is a DeepFake along the lines of Theranos. Theranos actually used industry standard blood work analysis equipment behind the scenes to analyze blood samples taken from patients, unknown to the patients or those being shown Theranos-built equipment that was SUPPOSED TO BE being used to make the blood analysis runs. To wit, with DeepSeek there is a back-end to DeepSeek that uses a panel, nay, a room full of generalists in a say a half dozen technical areas and ALL DeepSeek is, is really a per-processor for A) a more general search (Google?) engine AND B) kinda in parallel the questions, queries routed to the ‘room’ of subject matter experts/technical generalists … maybe the DeepSeek answers/searches get reviewed, or modified by a panel on a go/no go way … point being, this is one big show and fake as all get out, ala, Theranos (IF you know the full story there.) The Theranos story is apt. Claim was could do same blood chemistry analysis with a finger prick drop that otherwise took a full tube blood draw. The problem always was that never made any known analytic chemistry sense—you need a certain volume to get added reagents to produce a definitive result. Theranos was finally proven a giant scam. Could be the same here. Same ‘IQ’ from much more limited data training set simply does not logically compute, exactly analogous to Theranos. Do not accept the hype. Try the various AIs for yourself. Ask hard questions to which you know the answer, and you will learn a lot about how much the programmers know and what is IN the data base and what is not. It is not exciting, at least not yet, no matter the huge investments our not too bright oligarchs are making. My students seem to like AI’s editing capability most. Non- native English speakers benefit from AI, BUT AI is very wordy. It does not know about Samuel Clemens. If students use it without editing, it is easy to recognize the source. Fun new technical possibility just showed up this evening. It is possible that DeepSeek R1 was reverse engineered by ‘training’ on equivalent ChatGPT o1. The newly coined word for this possibility is ‘reverse engineering’—of course also illegal intellectual theft for which China is famous. We have a way to go for clarity. But China claims to have used markedly fewer resources to achieve what they announced. On that basis, it is not a lace of resources in the US, it is lack of a different approach.

NEW YORK (AP) — The superstar run for Nvidia’s stock the last few years has been astonishing. So was its tumble Monday, which caused $595 billion in wealth to vanish. That’s about as much as PepsiCo, McDonalds, Starbucks and Target are worth, combined. Mostly known only in gaming and crypto circles a few years ago, Nvidia burst into the zeitgeist after seeing its sales surge because customers wanted its chips to train their chatbots and other artificial intelligence products. Nvidia became a household name as its stock more than tripled in 2023 and then more than doubled in 2024. Investors and analysts lauded CEO Jensen Huang as the “Godfather of AI.” Nvidia grew into a $3 trillion-plus behemoth and traded places with titans like Apple to become the most valuable company on Wall Street. But that all came to a screeching halt Monday, at least for a moment, after a Chinese upstart called DeepSeek said it had developed a large-language model that could perform like ChatGPT and other U.S. rivals, but by using far less computing power. Here’s a look at how it all got to this point: How did it become a market darling? Nvidia’s roots began in gaming. The Santa Clara, California-based tech company’s invention of the graphics processor unit, or GPU, in 1999 helped spark the growth of the PC gaming market and redefined computer graphics. Now Nvidia’s specialized chips are key components that help power different forms of artificial intelligence, including the latest generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. Huang has dubbed AI “the next industrial revolution,” and Nvidia’s GPUs are designed to perform artificial intelligence tasks faster and more efficiently than general-purpose chips like CPUs. Tech giants are snapping up Nvidia chips as they wade deeper into AI — a movement that’s enabling cars to drive by themselves, and generating stories, art and music. The demand helped Nvidia's revenue grow by eye-popping levels, quarter after quarter. On Feb. 23, 2023, after Nvidia breezed past analysts' expectations for quarterly profit, Huang said that “AI is at an inflection point, setting up for broad adoption reaching into every industry.” The company's quarterly revenue at the time was $6.05 billion. That ramped up to $7.19 billion just three months later and then nearly doubled to $13.51 billion three months after that. Revenue has since vaulted to $35.08 billion in the three months through October 2024. The company's stock price has similarly soared, and its total market value quickly passed rivals like Intel, Microsoft and others. Nvidia alone accounted for more than a fifth of all of the S&P 500 index's total return last year. No other stock came close, and it had more than triple Apple's impact. Buy an S&P 500 index fund today, and nearly 6 cents out of every $1 will go only into Nvidia. That leaves 94 cents for all the other 499 companies. Is it still a darling? Unlike the dot-com boom, real money was behind Nvidia’s surge, and its stock price rose on expectations of ever more to come. Those expectations came into question on Monday. DeepSeek and its seemingly lower-cost operations raised worries about whether companies would need to spend as many dollars on Nvidia chips as previously thought. The concerns dragged down stocks across the AI industry, including suppliers to the chip industry and the power companies hoping to electrify the vast data centers that were expected to get built to run those chips. But Nvidia was in the spotlight because its stock has become the brightest symbol of the AI bonanza. Some on Wall Street saw Monday's nearly 17% plunge for Nvidia's stock as an opportunity rather than a signal of pending doom, saying the stock became more affordable. If AI does become cheaper to run, it could open the door to new kinds of customers and software innovations that could ultimately help the industry in the long term. “As for Nvidia itself, this isn’t the first time a major tech stock has faced existential questions,” said John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds. “We’ve seen similar situations with Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Google, Amazon, and Netflix — companies that were once doubted but ultimately rebounded.” DeepSeek's entrance certainly adds uncertainty to the entire AI ecosystem, but it doesn't change the overwhelming momentum behind the movement, according to Brian Colello, strategist at Morningstar. “We believe that AI GPU demand still exceeds supply,” he wrote in a report. "So, while slimmer models may enable greater development for the same number of chips, we still think tech firms will continue to buy all the GPUs they can as part of this AI 'gold rush.'" For its part, Nvidia's stock wobbled between gains and losses early Tuesday following its worst plunge since the 2020 COVID crash, and then rallied a bit and ended the day nearly 9% higher.

Title: The Biggest Winner In The DeepSeek Disruption Story Is Open Source AI

When the news about DeepSeek-R1 broke, the AI world was quick to frame it as yet another flashpoint ... [+] in the ongoing U.S.-China AI rivalry. But the real story, according to experts like Yann LeCun, is about the value of open source AI. (Photo by NICOLAS TUCAT/AFP via Getty Images) DeepSeek-R1 — the AI model created by DeepSeek, a little known Chinese company, at a fraction of what it cost OpenAI to build its own models — has sent the AI industry into a frenzy for the last couple of days. When the news about DeepSeek-R1 broke, the AI world was quick to frame it as yet another flashpoint in the ongoing U.S.-China AI rivalry. However, I argue that the real story isn’t about geopolitics, although there’s a strong geopolitical layer somewhere there. I believe that the real story is about the growing power of open-source AI and how it’s upending the traditional dominance of closed-source models — a line of thought that Yann LeCun, Meta’s chief AI scientist, also shares. LeCun, a vocal proponent of open-source AI, recently wrote in a LinkedIn post: “To people who see the performance of DeepSeek and think: ‘China is surpassing the U.S. in AI.’ You are reading this wrong. The correct reading is: ‘Open-source models are surpassing proprietary ones.’” While LeCun’s argument may seem simple, its message is far weightier than it appears on the surface: DeepSeek-R1 didn’t emerge from a vacuum. It built on the foundations of open-source research, leveraging previous advancements like Meta’s Llama models and the PyTorch ecosystem. DeepSeek’s remarkable success with its new AI model reinforces the notion that open-source AI is becoming more competitive with, and perhaps even surpassing, the closed, proprietary models of major technology firms. Open-source AI, according to the Open Source Initiative, is “an AI system made available under terms and in a way that grants the freedom to use the system for any purpose and without having to ask for permission, study how the system works and inspect its components, modify the system for any purpose, including to change its output, share the system for others to use with or without modifications, for any purpose.” The gist of all that jargon is that open-source AI models give you the freedom to modify and build whatever you want. It’s like having free, unrestricted access to all-purpose flour if you were a baker. Imagine the wide range of things you could bake. Closed source AI, on the other hand, means just the exact opposite. In closed AI models, the source codes and underlying algorithms are kept private and cannot be modified or built upon. The major argument for this type of approach is privacy. By keeping AI models closed, proponents of this approach say they can better protect users against data privacy breaches and potential misuse of the technology. But according to Manu Sharma, cofounder and CEO of Labelbox, “innovations in software are very hard to keep closed-source in today’s world. Almost every foundational piece of technology in AI is open source and has gained large mindshare.” Sharma believes we are witnessing the same trend in AI that we saw with databases and operating systems, where open solutions eventually dominated the industry. With proprietary models requiring massive investment in compute and data acquisition, open-source alternatives offer more attractive options to companies seeking cost-effective AI solutions. DeepSeek-R1’s training cost — reportedly just $6 million — has shocked industry insiders, especially when compared to the billions spent by OpenAI, Google and Anthropic on their frontier models. Kevin Surace, CEO of Appvance, called it a “wake-up call,” proving that “China has focused on low-cost rapid models while the U.S. has focused on huge models at a huge cost.” DeepSeek’s AI model undoubtedly raises a valid question about whether we are on the cusp of an AI price war. Even Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO, acknowledged in a tweet late yesterday that “DeepSeek’s R1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they’re able to deliver for the price.” Andy Thurai, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research, noted in his Weekly Tech Bytes newsletter on LinkedIn that DeepSeek’s efficiency will inevitably put downward pressure on AI costs. “If it is proven that the entire AI software supply chain can be done cheaply using open-source software, many startups will take a hit. VCs will stop writing blank checks to start-ups that have generative AI on their pitch deck.” Venture-backed AI firms that rely on closed-source models to justify their high valuations could take a devastating hit in the aftermath of the DeepSeek tsunami. Companies that fail to differentiate themselves beyond the mere ability to train LLMs could face significant funding challenges. However, not everyone is enthusiastic about open-source AI taking center stage. Indeed, open-source models democratize AI access, but they also introduce concerns about security, misuse and privacy. Surace raised concerns about DeepSeek’s origins, noting that “privacy is an issue because it’s China. It’s always about collecting data from users. So users beware.” While DeepSeek’s model weights and codes are open, its training data sources remain largely opaque, making it difficult to assess potential biases or security risks. Syed Hussain and Neil Benedict, cofounders of Shiza.ai, expressed significant concerns about both the technical claims and potential security implications of DeepSeek. Both Hussain and Benedict viewed DeepSeek not as merely a company competing in the market, but as potentially part of a broader Chinese state strategy that might be aimed at disrupting the U.S. AI industry and market confidence. While people also worry about U.S. companies having access to their data, those companies are bound by U.S. privacy laws and constitutional protections, said Benedict. In contrast, he argued that “DeepSeek, potentially tied to the Chinese state, operates under different rules and motivations.” While he admitted that many U.S. companies also have profit-driven motivations for data collection, he said DeepSeek’s free model raises questions about hidden incentives. Hussain further described DeepSeek as “a potential Trojan horse,” suggesting that “it could be a sophisticated data collection operation masked as a competitive AI product.” However, Thurai emphasized the transparency problem in AI models, regardless of origin. “When choosing a model, transparency, the model creation process, and auditability should be more important than just the cost of usage,” he said. While DeepSeek-R1 is open-source, many companies may hesitate to adopt it without clearer disclosures about its dataset and safety mechanisms. The financial markets have already reacted to DeepSeek’s impact. Although Nvidia’s stock has slightly rebounded by 6%, it faced short-term volatility, reflecting concerns that cheaper AI models will reduce demand for the company’s high-end GPUs. But Sharma remains bullish on Nvidia’s long-term prospects. “Affordable and abundant AGI means many more people are going to use it faster, and use it everywhere. Compute demand around inference will soar,” he told me. This suggests that while training costs may decline, the demand for AI inference — running models efficiently at scale — will continue to grow. Companies like Nvidia may pivot toward optimizing hardware for inference workloads rather than focusing solely on the next wave of ultra-large training clusters. If DeepSeek-R1 has proven anything, it’s that high-performance open-source models are here to stay — and they may become the dominant force in AI development. As LeCun noted, “DeepSeek has profited from open research and open source (e.g. PyTorch and Llama from Meta). Because their work is published and open source, everyone can profit from it. That is the power of open research and open source.” Businesses now need to rethink their reliance on closed-source models and consider the benefits of contributing to — and benefiting from — an open AI ecosystem. Moving forward, the debate won’t just be about an “AI Cold War” between the U.S. and China, but about whether the future of AI will be more open, accessible and shared or closed, proprietary and expensive. The genie is out of the bottle, though. And it looks like it’s open-source. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

DeepSeek just made this earnings season a lot more interesting. A slew of Big Tech names are due to report this week and next. Tesla, Meta, and Microsoft take center stage on January 29, with Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon hot on their heels. Investors were already scrutinizing the companies, which have been spending multiple billions of dollars on building AI models and infrastructure, for signs about whether the outlay on staff, chips, and data centers is delivering returns. Now DeepSeek has made justifying that spending to investors and analysts a lot trickier for execs, PR, and IR. "I expect pretty much everyone to get questions on it," Morningstar analyst William Kerwin said. DeepSeek's new AI model, R1, shook the tech industry this week, wiping more than $1 trillion off US stocks in market cap in one day. It offers a model that seems similarly effective to ones made by US companies. Moreover, the Chinese company said it cost less than $6 million to train. In comparison, Meta has said it plans to invest over $60 billion in AI infrastructure in 2025. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion partnership involving OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank to build AI infrastructure in the US. Markets stabilized a little by Tuesday, but the panic shows how DeepSeek's impact will be top of mind during earnings calls, analysts told Business Insider. Investors will want to know if R1 changes companies' views on future infrastructure spending, Kerwin said. That could "temper the demand" for chips from Nvidia, Forrester analysts said in a Tuesday note. Tech companies like Meta and Elon Musk's xAI have been buying and using hundreds of thousands of specialist Nvidia chips for their AI models, helping its stock price rocket. Monday's tech rout already wiped about 17% off Nvidia's market cap. However, having access to cheaper models could pay off in the longer term because of "creation opportunities for many, many more startups and enterprises alike, thereby increasing demand," per Forrester. Apple, which reports after the bell on Thursday, stands to gain from a decline in cost for AI training. The iPhone maker took a lower-cost AI strategy than competitors, and it would benefit from integrating cost-effective training for Apple Intelligence, analysts told BI. Although Apple's stock gained on Monday, CEO Tim Cook should still expect DeepSeek chatter, analysts said. Nvidia won't report earnings until February 26, yet will likely still have to answer DeepSeek questions. And across the board, "Beyond cost concerns, tech leaders will need to address whether this signals a need to shift toward more efficient AI development approaches that could reshape strategic planning," Jacob Bourne, analyst at BI sister company EMARKETER, said.

The release of a less capital-intensive artificial intelligence model from China’s DeepSeek sent a chill through the U.S. stock market this week, headlined by losses Monday and Wednesday from Nvidia, the Silicon Valley giant which designs most of the pricey semiconductor technology powering the AI revolution. DeepSeek has been accused of using outputs generated by OpenAI's tools to train its latest AI model. Jan. 29, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends Wednesday trading down 4% in a turbulent session that wiped out about $130 billion in market value, with earnings reports from top customers Meta, Nvidia and Tesla all due this afternoon all potential catalysts for further movement in the stock. To recap Nvidia’s whipsaw week: Its market value fell by about $590 billion Monday, rose by roughly $260 billion Tuesday and dropped $130 billion Wednesday. Wall Street analysts still mostly view the selloff as a overreaction, and Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya wrote Wednesday to clients they “view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity” for Nvidia stock, reaffirming faith in hundreds of billions of dollars of spending this decade in the AI technology which Nvidia designs. Jan. 29, 1:30 p.m. EST President Donald Trump is considering placing more restrictions on Nvidia’s semiconductor chip sales to China beyond what the Biden administration placed in an effort to limit AI advancement in the Asian country, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources. It’s unclear if the potentially amped-up controls are directly tied to the DeepSeek fallout — Nvidia said Monday the Chinese AI group fully complied with existing export laws with its use of Nvidia’s technology — though Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, laid into DeepSeek at his Wednesday confirmation hearing, saying: “Nvidia’s chips, which they bought tons of, and they found their ways around, drive their DeepSeek model. It’s got to end.” China accounted for more than 15% of Nvidia’s revenues in its most recent quarter. Jan. 29, 12 p.m. EST Nvidia’s Wall Street woes continued as shares dropped about 5% by midday, bringing the stock’s loss this week back up to nearly 15%. Jan. 29, 9:40 a.m. EST After mounting a historic comeback Wednesday, Nvidia stock fell again, declining about 3% in the first 10 minutes of regular trading, leading a broader tech slump as the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Tesla all declined roughly 1% apiece. Jan. 29, 8:30 a.m. EST New York-listed shares of Chinese technology giant Alibaba rise more than 3% in premarket trading, set to open at their highest level since early November. Alibaba said earlier Wednesday the latest version of its Qwen generative AI model scored better on several performance tests than the models from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI and Meta. Jan. 29, 3 a.m. EST OpenAI told the Financial Times that it has seen some evidence that its AI models were used by DeepSeek to train its own—which would be a breach of the ChatGPT maker’s terms of services. Bloomberg previously reported that Microsoft and OpenAI were investigating whether DeepSeek gained access to OpenAI’s data outputs in an unauthorized manner. Jan. 29, 12 a.m. EST White House artificial intelligence czar David Sacks told Fox News that there was “substantial evidence” suggesting that Deepseek had “distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,” adding “I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this.” In this context, distillation is a process where an AI model uses responses generated by other, more powerful, AI models to aid its development. Sacks added that over the next few months he expects leading U.S. AI companies will be "taking steps to try and prevent distillation” to slow down “these copycat models.” Jan. 28, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends normal trading up 8.8%, scoring its best percentage gain in six months. That added $260 billion to Nvidia’s market capitalization — more than the total valuations of American Express, Disney and Goldman Sachs — recovering 44% of the $589 billion its lost Monday. Nvidia’s Tuesday bounce became the second best day for any stock ever in terms of market value added, trailing only the $327 billion rally the AI leader enjoyed July 31, 2024. Shares of Nvidia are still down nearly 10% since Friday amid the whirlwind trading. Jan. 28, 1:45 p.m. ESTApple stock rallied 4% to about $239 per share, building on its 3% gain Monday as many of its Silicon Valley peers faltered and extending its market value added this week to about $240 billion. The two-day bounce for Apple shares, which had suffered a 14% pullback in the month ending Friday, comes as investors warm to the iPhone maker’s approach to largely watch the generative AI arms race from the sidelines as its trillion-dollar peers like Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft invested billions into generative AI projects. Apple emerges as a “relative winner” as DeepSeek shifted investor narratives on AI, wrote Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak in a Tuesday note to clients, explaining Apple’s “AI ambitions are far more contained” than the other “magnificent seven” American tech leaders. Apple also stands to greatly benefit from any advancements from large-language models, like DeepSeek’s, as Apple “owns the most valuable consumer technology distribution platform that exists,” Nowak added. Whether Apple stock’s “contained” generative AI ambitions were the result of financial discipline or inadequate innovation is up to interpretation, but Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern quipped, “Apple’s behind-everyone-else-in-AI approach look like a calculated master plan.” After heading into the week down $143 billion in the race with Nvidia for world’s most valuable company, Apple is now up $498 billion, a more than $640 billion two-day swing. Jan. 28, 12:20 p.m. ESTNvidia settles into a more than 5.5% gain by midday trading, helping lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to a more than 1.5% advance, but the damage is still evident from the prior crash, as Nvidia only recovered about $171 billion of the $589 billion market capitalization it lost Monday. Jan. 28, 10 a.m. ESTMorgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore offers perhaps the most palpably negative major analyst reaction to DeepSeek, cutting his price target for Nvidia from $166 to $152 due to the “deflationary” prospects of cheaper AI buildouts and the potential for “further export controls or reduce spending enthusiasm” — Morgan Stanley maintains a buy rating for the stock and its $152 target implies 27% upside from Nvidia’s $120 share price Tuesday. Jan. 28, 9:35 a.m. ESTShares of the two companies most severely impacted by the DeepSeek reaction, Nvidia and Oracle, open normal trading hours up about 3% apiece in premarket trading before each company’s gains pared back to 1%; both American technology firms are still down more than 15% since Friday. Jan. 28, 8:45 a.m. ESTAnalyst reactions to the historic selloff largely characterized the losses as out of proportion: UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said Oracle’s drop “felt excessive” and Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore added “geopolitical dynamics are a key driver of this volatility” in tech stocks in respective notes to clients. Jan. 28, 6:00 a.m. ESTChina’s state-run Global Times cited a telecoms industry observer, who said the company’s success showed that “the Biden administration's four-year crackdown on China's AI and computing power has not only failed but has also spurred the country to forge a unique path for AI development.” People within China’s tech industry also hailed DeepSeek’s success. In a widely shared post on the social media platform Weibo, Game Science co-founder Feng Ji—the studio which published the hit game Black Myth: Wukong—wrote “DeepSeek may be a scientific and technology achievement that can change a nation’s fate...Such a shocking breakthrough coming from a purely Chinese company. Jan. 27, 10:00 p.m. ESTOpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised DeepSeek’s R1, saying it is an “impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,” and added “we will obviously deliver much better models and...we will pull up some releases.” Jan. 27, 6:30 p.m. ESTPresident Donald Trump said at a House Republican retreat that the launch of the AI model was “a positive development” but should be considered a “wake-up” call for U.S. industries, lauding the move for what he hoped would usher in a future of “coming up with a faster method of AI, and much less expensive method.” Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTThe DeepSeek-driven stock market plunge caused some of the world’s wealthiest people to lose tens of billions on paper, led by Oracle’s Larry Ellison (net worth down $27.6 billion) and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang (down $20.8 billion)—here’s a full list. Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTStocks were battered by DeepSeek’s debut: The S&P 500 closed down 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged just over 3%—its worst day since Dec. 18 and fourth-worst day of the last two years. Jan. 27, 4 p.m. ESTSemiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia closed down 17%, knocking $589 billion off its market cap in the biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history—along with heavy losses at chipmakers Broadcom (17%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (13%), and smaller falls for Microsoft (2%) and Tesla (2%). Jan. 27, 3:28 p.m. ESTForbes found DeepSeek refused to answer questions on several controversial topics linked to the Chinese government, like, “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” and “What are the biggest criticisms of Xi Jinping?” The model did provide detailed answers when asked about common criticisms of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Jan. 27, 3 p.m. ESTNvidia releases its first statement on DeepSeek as its stock dipped to a 18% loss on the day, calling the Chinese company’s model “an excellent AI advancement” — the full statement from a Nvidia spokesperson is as follows: “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Jan. 27, 12:50 p.m. ESTDavid Sacks, President Donald Trump’s “AI & Crypto Czar,” offers his first comments on DeepSeek, saying the Chinese company’s success “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and “we can’t be complacent,” supporting Trump’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s executive order placing guardrails on AI development, which Sacks said “hamstrung” U.S. AI innovation. Jan. 27, 12:45 p.m. EST Oracle chairman Larry Ellison (down $24.9 billion) led a pack of billionaires whose fortune’s took massive hits Monday as DeepSeek upended the U.S. stock market, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ($19.8 billion), Dell CEO Michael Dell ($12.4 billion), Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($5.3 billion) and Google cofounder Larry Page ($4.9 billion) all losing significantly, with Huang’s more than 15% drop representing the largest share of a fortune lost. Jan. 27, 12:30 p.m. ESTU.S. stocks got walloped Monday morning: The S&P 500 was down about 1.8% at 12:30 p.m. EST, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.4%. Jan. 27, 11:15 a.m. ESTShares of Nvidia plunged 15% by 11:15 a.m. EST, heading toward its worst daily percentage loss since March 2020, when stocks briefly crashed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially becoming the single greatest single-day loss in terms of market cap of any company in history. Broadcom had slipped 16% as of 11:30 a.m. Jan. 27, 9:30 a.m. ESTDomestic leaders in AI showed stinging losses at market open Monday as Microsoft dropped 4% and Tesla slipped 2%, with semiconductor chip architect Nvidia diving 12% and other big chip stocks like Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company falling more than 10% apiece. Jan. 27, 7:30 a.m. ESTJPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande questioned in a note to clients how DeepSeek’s low-cost success “is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” Jan. 27, 5 a.m. ESTReferring to the Magnificent 7 set of trillion-dollar U.S. companies including Nvidia and Tesla accounting for much of the 2020s bull market, Yardeni Research founder Ed Yardeni noted a “competitive threat to their magnificence has emerged from China.” Jan. 26Billionaire investor Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s R1 model "AI's Sputnik moment." Jan. 25The DeepSeek mobile app became the No. 1 app in iPhone stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the U.S. and the U.K. Jan. 22ByteDance, another Chinese company, revealed an update to its flagship AI model and word started circulating that the new overseas products posed a strategic threat to the U.S. tech giants pursuing AI dominance. Jan. 20DeepSeek launched its R1 advanced reasoning model, claiming it rivaled OpenAI's o1 product on several performance benchmarks and was created for far less money than spent by American companies like Microsoft and Meta. The selloff stems from weekend panic over last week’s release from the relatively unknown Chinese firm DeepSeek of its competitive generative AI model rivaling OpenAI, the American firm backed by Microsoft and Nvidia, and its viral chatbot ChatGPT, with DeepSeek notably running at a fraction of the cost of U.S.-based rivals. The idea of a rival undercutting the largely U.S.-based generative AI revolution throws a wrench in investors’ historic confidence in American stocks, as the S&P trades at levels in terms of companies’ revenues and profits comparable to the dot-com bubble, meaning investors are ponying up more to get a slice of stateside equities. DeepSeek is “bad news” for American tech behemoths with “plans to dominate the AI market with their expensive AI services,” cautioned Yardeni. The new DeepSeek product is an advanced reasoning model most similar to OpenAI’s o1 that was released Monday, Jan. 20. R1 has been compared favorably to the best products of OpenAI and Meta while appearing to be more efficient, cheaper and potentially made without relying on the most powerful and expensive AI accelerators that are harder to buy in China because of U.S. export controls. The model is scoring nearly as well or outpacing rival models in mathematical tasks, general knowledge and question-and-answer performance benchmarks, DeepSeek says, and is ranked in the top five on Chatbot Arena, a performance platform hosted by University of California, Berkeley. Don’t “buy into the doomsday scenarios currently playing out” about DeepSeek, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a Monday note to clients, adding the “panic over the weekend seems overblown.” DeepSeek’s assertion it cost just $5.6 million in computing power to develop its model is “categorically false,” according Rasgon, who said the misleading figure does not account for other “substantial” costs related to its AI model’s development. American AI billionaires like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and ScaleAI CEO Alexandr Wang theorize DeepSeek actually owns more than $1 billion worth of Nvidia equipment. DeepSeek is a new entrant to the AI large-language model arms race involving OpenAI, Facebook parent Meta and Google parent Alphabet. The AI battle came to a national stage last week when President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion joint venture building out the infrastructure necessary to power OpenAI’s artificial general intelligence initiatives. In his speech last Tuesday, Trump specifically called out the importance for the U.S. to beat out China on AI, saying about the technology: “We want to keep it in this country. China is a competitor and others are competitors.” Major tech figures including billionaire Trump allies Marc Andreessen and Vivek Ramaswamy each likened DeepSeek’s new technology to a “Sputnik moment” for American AI. Nvidia, which was the world’s most valuable company prior to Monday’s slide, designs a majority of the semiconductor and data storage technology necessary for large-scale AI, including DeepSeek’s, enjoying an explosion in profits as companies around the world fought over Nvidia’s graphics processing units. The magnificent seven includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, accounting for about $17 trillion of market value between the seven giants. The AI revolution boosted American stocks to record leadership in the global stock market, with U.S. companies accounting for 67% of the world equity market at the end of 2024, according to MSCI. The S&P is up 201% over the last decade through Friday, trouncing the 8% loss for China’s leading CSI 300 index and the 33% gain for Europe’s Stoxx 600 over the period, according to FactSet data. Monday’s selloff sets the stage for a notable week for Big Tech stocks. Meta, Microsoft and Tesla will all report fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday afternoon, while Apple will follow Thursday.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 rebounded on Tuesday, following a steep stock sell-off spurred by Chinese startup DeepSeek and the ripple effect its potentially cheaper AI model could have on Big Tech. Bellwether Nvidia (NVDA) was the standout of the trading day, with shares finishing the day up nearly 9% after it shaved off a record $589 billion from its market cap in the previous session. Aided by Nvidia's gains, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) surged over 2%, coming off a closing loss of more than 3%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose around 0.9%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained roughly 0.3%. Notably, the tech sector notched its biggest two-day reversal in over two years after it notched its worst day since March 2020 on Monday. Stocks began to chip away at losses booked in Monday's tech-led rout, which came as buzz built for DeepSeek's potentially cheaper AI model. That risk to US leadership in AI raised questions about whether chipmakers and other tech names can follow through on high earnings expectations. With the DeepSeek risk in mind, focus is tighter on Big Tech earnings coming this week, with results from Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) on the docket. Investors also assessed a tougher tone on tariffs from President Donald Trump as markets look ahead to the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision on Wednesday where the impact of his policies will likely be discussed. The central bank is expected to leave interest rates unchanged, given recent solid economic readings. The dollar (DX=F) strengthened after renewed tariff threats from Trump that revived worries about a trade war, already in focus after a brief standoff with Colombia. Trump said he wants universal tariffs "much bigger" than the 2.5% his incoming Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, reportedly plans to introduce gradually. Starbucks (SBUX) stock rose over 4% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the coffee giant reported earnings that beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Same-store sales declined for the fourth consecutive quarter as the company looks to continue its recent turnaround plan. “While we have room for improvement, we’re making progress as planned, and have confidence we’re on the right track,” Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol said in a video released Tuesday afternoon. The company’s same-store sales, a key metric for restaurant chains, fell 4% year over year in the reported quarter, with traffic to its stores declining by 6%. Wall Street had expected same-store sales and foot traffic to decline by 5.30% and 7.28%, respectively, year over year. Outside of domestic markets, same-store sales also declined 4%, while sales in China — the company's second-largest market — fell by 6%. Stocks closed in the green on Tuesday as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 rebounded from Monday's steep sell-off spurred by Chinese startup DeepSeek and its potentially cheaper AI model. Bellwether Nvidia (NVDA) finished the day up nearly 9% after it shaved off a record $589 billion from its market cap on Monday. Aided by Nvidia's gains, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) surged over 2%, coming off a closing loss of more than 3%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose around 0.9%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained roughly 0.3%. The fourth volume of Yahoo Finance's Chartbook, released on Tuesday, tells the story of markets and economy through 44 charts. And given that we ask a broad question about what the most important chart is for investors right now, there's sometimes a takeaway in what respondents don't send. After the past several versions of this book included many charts making the case for interest rate cuts, there was little discussion of further easing from the Federal Reserve throughout our latest collection of charts. Dynamic Economic Strategy CEO John Silvia's submission helps explain why. Silvia pointed out that at 4.1%, the unemployment rate is hovering near where the Fed expects it to end this year, while private payroll growth has come off the boil. To Silvia, this shows a labor market that may be normalizing right in the area the Fed would like it to stay. This, Silvia said, provides "less room for the Fed to ease as job/economic growth continues to move ahead and long-run full employment is on the horizon." With inflation relatively sticky and the labor market holding up OK, many economists right now seem more interested in Trump's policies. Specifically the focus centers around how tariffs could impact inflation, and therefore Fed policy, before making further conclusions on the path forward for interest rates. Check out the full Yahoo Finance Chartbook here. Some breaking news that's not related to DeepSeek or Wall Street's AI trades: The Container Store has emerged from bankruptcy. Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma has the latest: The struggling home goods store emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Tuesday, Yahoo Finance learned exclusively. In a release, the company said it "achieved the objectives it set for this process" in late December. That includes refinancing its short-term debt, reducing "previous long-term debt obligations," gaining access to $40 million in new money financing, and "modifying its asset-backed lending facility to add $40 million in upsized capacity." Throughout the process, the business operated as usual across stores, online, and in-home services. It was also able to "[meet] its obligations to vendors, employees and customers." No employees were let go, but the company did close down two stores since the bankruptcy filing. The closings were separate from the bankruptcy process. Formerly under the ticker TCSG, the company is now private after the restructuring process. For the quarter ended Sept. 28, 2024, the Container Store listed total liabilities of $836.4 million against $969 million in total assets. Read more here. Nvidia (NVDA) rose as much as 7% Tuesday afternoon as tech stocks rebounded from a sharp sell-off. The AI chip giant bounced back from its 17% drop on Monday sparked by investor anxiety related to a new AI model recently launched by Chinese startup DeepSeek. The artificial intelligence assistant, seen as more efficient and less expensive than its American-made rivals, spooked investor sentiment over AI dominance in the US and raised questions about valuations and spending. AI-exposed power stocks attempted a rebound on Tuesday after getting crushed in the tech rout prompted by fears that energy demand for the artificial intelligence boom may be ahead of its skies. Constellation Energy (CEG), the largest nuclear plant operator in the US was relatively flat after tumbling 21% during the prior session. Electricity generator Vistra Corp (VST) rose more than 4% after sinking by a record 28%. Power equipment maker and servicer GE Vernova (GEV) also gained 2%, retracing a fraction of its one-day 21% drop. AI-exposed energy stocks were recovering from a beating on Monday after Chinese startup DeepSeek released a new AI model viewed as more competitive and energy-efficient compared to its US rivals. The sell-off rattled investors given the optimism over electricity needs to power the booming AI data center industry. Power stocks are coming off a ripping rally in 2024 and start of the year. Paul Zimbardo, managing director for US power utilities & clean energy research at Jeffrries, said data center deployment is "very likely intact" in the medium term as the race remains "on." The question going forward is what happens in the later part of the decade and 2030s. "Does that trend accelerate in the future? Does it kind of stabilize and even see some moderation of demand growth out later in the decade?" asked the analyst. Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports: New mixed messages this week about President Donald Trump's implementation of tariffs are flummoxing markets and businesses hoping for quick clarity on the 2.0 version of Trump's trade policy. The main point of confusion is that public signals from Trump’s orbit often appear at odds with Trump himself. The sometimes contradictory back and forth — a feature of the debate around tariffs since Trump's win — is taking on an outsized importance with the approach of Trump’s self-imposed Feb. 1 deadline, whe he has promised to install 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% duties on China. Read more here. OpenAI on Tuesday announced a new tailored version of ChatGPT designed for US government agencies, a product launch that comes as the industry is still reeling from the breakout of a cost-efficient Chinese AI startup and as President Trump has urged tech companies to stay ahead of the competition. OpenAI says the new service, ChatGPT Gov, is meant to streamline the government's access to its models and it will give staffers the ability to better manage their own security and compliance as agencies handle sensitive data. "By making our products available to the U.S. government, we aim to ensure AI serves the national interest and the public good, aligned with democratic values, while empowering policymakers to responsibly integrate these capabilities to deliver better services to the American people," the company said in a statement unveiling the new tool. Read more about ChatGPT Gov's product launch here. Tech stocks led the major averages higher on Tuesday with the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gaining more than 1% on Tuesday. Apple (AAPL), an outlier during Monday's tech rout, extended gains to rise more than 3%. Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), and Microsoft (MSFT) also rose. AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) rose more than 2% in early trading, retracing a fraction of its 17% plunge from the prior session. JetBlue (JBLU) shares fell as much as 22% on Tuesday, their biggest drop since 2020 after the air carrier posted disappointing first quarter outlook for revenue per available seat mile (RASM). For the current three month period, JetBlue forecasts revenue per available seat mile between a decline of 0.5% and an increase of 3.5%, versus estimates for growth above 4%. JetBlue's fourth quarter loss came in narrower than expected, at an adjusted loss per share of $0.21, versus estimates for - $0.31. The domestic low-cost carrier also faces higher costs. JetBlue has faced a number of challenges over the past year, including a blocked merger with peer Spirit in 2024. US home prices hit a record high in November as the pace of price increases picked up. The S&P Case-Shiller National Home Price Index rose 3.8% from a year earlier in November on a seasonally adjusted basis, higher than the 3.6% annual increase in October. The data captures a three-month period through November when mortgage rates were climbing toward 7%, providing little relief for would-be buyers in a seasonally slower selling season. Despite the rise in borrowing costs, the national index hit a record high for the 18th consecutive month on a seasonally adjusted basis. Still, on a monthly basis, prices ticked up 0.4% over the prior month in November, up from October's 0.3% monthly increase. Brian D. Luke, head of commodities at S&P CoreLogic, said in a statement, “With the exception of pockets of above-trend performance, national home prices are trending below historical averages.” The index tracking home prices in the 20 largest metropolitan areas gained 4.3% in November from a year earlier, compared with a 4.2% increase in the previous month, according to S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller data. New York remained the top state for annual gains, with a 7.3% increase. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 attempted to recover on Tuesday from a sharp tech-led rout prompted by AI worries. The Federal Reserve two-day policy meeting which started earlier in the morning was also in focus for investors. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose more than 0.4% after sliding 3% in the prior session. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hovered near the flatline. AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) rose more than 2%, attempting to recover from a 17% plunge in the prior session as the buzz around Chinese startup DeepSeek raised questions of overvaluation and spending in much of the US artificial intelligence space. Investors are keeping a close eye on any additional tariff talk from President Trump and how that may impact economic growth. The market now awaits the Federal Reserve's policy decision expected on Wednesday afternoon following their two-day meeting. Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose 2.5% pre-market Tuesday as the AI chipmaker began to recover from a massive decline the prior day that shaved nearly $600 billion off its market cap. Nvidia’s 17% free-fall Monday was prompted by investor anxieties related to a new, cost-effective AI model from the Chinese startup DeepSeek. Some Wall Street analysts worried that the cheaper costs DeepSeek claimed to have spent training its latest AI models, due in part to using fewer AI chips, meant US firms were overspending on artificial intelligence infrastructure. Nvidia’s $589 billion market cap decline was the largest single-day loss in stock market history. The DeepSeek announcements drove down not only Nvidia but the market at large, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropping 3%. Chip stocks dropped across the board Monday but began to recover Tuesday morning. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi reports: General Motors (GM) chair and CEO Mary Barra has made her case on tariffs to President Trump. "We've done a lot of scenario planning and we know the levers that we can pull to minimize any impact. But, having the opportunity to talk to the president, I really believe he wants a strong manufacturing sector because it's good for the economy," Barra told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. GM on its earnings release today said it assumes a "stable" policy environment. Its full-year 2025 EPS guidance of $11 to $12 was ahead of consensus forecasts for $10.75 and doesn't assume any impact of additional tariffs. Read more here.

Meta seems to have reassured investors about how much it's spending on artificial intelligence and about possible competition from Chinese AI company DeepSeek. The company reported fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the closing bell. Its revenue for the period was $48.39 billion, beating the consensus analyst estimate of $46.98 billion. While its first-quarter sales forecast came in below estimates, investors seemed more concerned about other matters. During Meta's earnings conference call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg fielded questions from analysts on the company's recent content moderation changes, its big spending plans for 2025, TikTok, and more. He teased Llama 4 news and said he was "optimistic" about "progress and innovation" under Donald Trump's government. Zuckerberg also responded to a question about DeepSeek, saying it was important to have a domestic firm set the standard on open-source AI "for our own national advantage." Meta began its earnings conference call uncharacteristically late, perhaps owing to news that broke immediately before that President Trump had signed an agreement in which Meta would pay $25 million to settle a lawsuit he brought against the company after being suspended from Facebook in 2021 following the January 6 Capitol riots. Meta's stock gained in volatile after-hours trading as Zuckerberg spoke on the call. Shares edged 0.3% higher in Wednesday trading. Moments before Meta reported its results, The Wall Street Journal reported that President Trump had settled the lawsuit he filed against Meta after being suspended from Facebook in 2021. Business Insider confirmed the settlement with both Trump's lawyer and a Meta spokesperson. Much of the $25 million will go toward funding Trump's presidential library. "The actual business opportunity for meta AI and AI studio and business agents and people interacting with these AIs remains outside of '25 for the most part," he said when asked about the monetization potential for Meta AI. "My kind of expectation and hope is that we will be at a sufficient scale, and have a sufficient kind of flywheel of people using it," he added. "But that doesn't mean that it's going to be a major contributor to the business this year. This year, the improvements to the business are going to be taking the AI methods and applying them to advertising and recommendations and feeds and things like that." The company earlier this month announced it was getting rid of third-party fact-checkers and would instead adopt a community notes-based model, similar to that of Elon Musk's X, formerly Twitter. Zuckerberg believes a community notes model "is just going to be more effective than the system that we had before." He seemed to address some of the criticisms people have voiced about the change. "I think that there's been a lot of people who who've read this announcement as if we somehow don't care about adding context to things that are on our platform that are misinformation. That's not right," he said. Meta hasn't seen any noticeable impact on advertiser spending following the decision, CFO Susan Li added. Chinese AI lab DeepSeek made headlines recently and sent tech stocks tumbling with the release of its model, R1. Like Meta's AI, DeepSeek calls its model open-source. "In light of some of the recent news, you know, the new competitor, DeepSeek from China, I think it's also one of the things that we're talking about, is there's going to be an open-source standard globally, and I think for our own national advantage, it's important that it's an American standard," Zuckerberg said. "So we take that seriously, and we want to build the AI system that people around the world are using. And I think that, if anything, some of the recent news has only strengthened our conviction that this is the right thing for us to be focused on." "We now have a US administration that is proud of our leading companies, prioritizes American technology winning, and that will defend our values and interests abroad," he said. "And I am optimistic about the progress and innovation that this can unlock." Meta was one of the first major US companies to make a $1 million donation to President Trump's inaugural fund last year, and Zuckerberg was one of several tech execs seated on the platform at Trump's inauguration on January 20. Zuckerberg explicitly mentioned TikTok's uncertain future in Wednesday's earnings call. "We're going to learn what's gonna happen with TikTok," Zuckerberg said. "And regardless of that, I expect reels on Instagram and Facebook to continue growing." TikTok's future is still in limbo following a tumultuous few weeks, including a Supreme Court ruling, a brief shut-down, and an executive order by President Trump. Meta, meanwhile, is courting content creators with payouts to flood Instagram and Facebook. The company is paying some creators through a "Breakthrough Bonus" that pays up to $5,000 within 90 days. The company is also paying select creators between $2,500 and $50,000 per month as part of content deals for reels posted to Instagram. CFO Susan Li highlighted several features that Meta has rolled out to reels this month, as well. Meta is "investing aggressively in initiatives that use these AI advances to increase revenue growth, and we've put together a plan that will hopefully accelerate the pace of these initiatives over the next few years," he said. The company expects $60 to $65 billion in capital expenditures this year as it accelerates its AI efforts, up significantly from $39.23 billion for 2024. "That's what a lot of our new headcount growth is going towards, and how well we execute on this will also determine our financial trajectory over the next few years," he said. Meta's CEO said he believes 2025 "will be the year when a highly intelligent and personalized AI assistant reaches more than 1 billion people, and I expect Meta AI to be that leading AI assistant." He teased what's coming with Llama 4, which he says will be natively multimodal — referring to AI models that can process data from multiple modes, such as text, video, and audio — and have agentic capabilities. "Our goal with Llama 3 was to make open-source competitive with closed models, and our goal for Llama 4 is to lead." Zuckerberg also thinks an AI engineering agent with coding and problem-solving abilities similar to those of a mid-level engineer could be within reach this year. "Whichever company builds this first, I think, is going to have a meaningful advantage in deploying it to advance their AI research and shape the field," he said. 4th quarter Revenue: $48.39 billion, +21% y/y, estimate $46.98 billion Operating income: $23.37 billion, estimate $20.09 billion Meta likely announced its plan for $60 billion of capex this year to emphasize its focus on artificial intelligence, CFRA Research said. "We think it makes sense for META to get the news out of the way before earnings on Jan. 29 and note the increased focus on AI will likely translate to higher revenue potential over time," Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA, wrote. The firm reiterated its "Buy" rating on the stock. Meta appears to have strong growth momentum, Jefferies said in a note. Analysts estimated that Meta's revenue will come in around $46.5 billion over the fourth quarter, while first-quarter revenue guidance will be around $41.8 billion. "Overall, we continue to be encouraged by META's ability to sustain DD rev growth, given the combination of higher engagement from AI investments, increased advertiser efficiency and ramping of incremental monetization formats (e.g. WhatsApp & Llama)." The firm reiterated its "Buy" rating on the stock and issued a price target of $715, implying 5% upside from current levels. Meta will likely be a key beneficiary of TikTok's challenges in the US, Truist Securities said in a note. According to Sensor Tower, a social media analytics site, Threads saw a significant uptick in user time over the fourth quarter, likely due to the risk of TikTok being shut down, Truist said. "We view META as a key beneficiary of TikTok's mishaps and as one of our 2025 favorites," Youssef Squali, a managing director at the firm, wrote in a note. Truist reiterated its "Buy" rating on the stock and price target of $700, implying 3% upside from current levels. Meta has said it's planning more than $60 billion in capital expenditures this year and will expand its AI teams "significantly." The announcement is a sign that markets are still in the early stages of the AI investment cycle, which is positive for mega-cap tech firms, JMP analysts said. "Meta's willingness to invest also suggests to us that near-term revenue visibility is positive as we believe Meta continues to benefit from its AI product initiatives," the firm wrote in a note. The firm maintained its "Market Outperform" rating on the stock and issued a price target of $750, implying 10% upside from current levels. A host of tailwinds may be building for Meta this year, Bank of America said. Analysts wrote that the company is still in the early stages of monetizing its AI projects and integrating the tech into its messaging platforms, such as WhatsApp and Messenger. Meta may also stand to benefit from any disruption to TikTok, with some firms potentially shifting to Meta to advertise. "With a stable macro backdrop, a growing AI contribution to ad revenues, ramping messaging revenues, and continued cost discipline (recent headcount cuts), we remain positive on the stock in 2025," analysts added. The bank has a "Buy" rating on the stock. It raised its price target to $710 a share, implying 5% upside from current levels. 4th quarter Revenue estimate: $46.98 billion Operating income estimate: $20.09 billion First quarter Full year Source: Bloomberg data Jump to

Title: DeepSeek Could Spur Enterprise AI Adoption, Experts Say

Chinese AI startup DeepSeek’s deeply discounted foundation models could herald lower prices for businesses seeking to adopt AI — by removing one of the biggest blockers to enterprise deployment. “Cost is the biggest hurdle to adoption of AI applications,” wrote BofA Global Research analysts Brad Sills and Carly Liu in a note published on Tuesday (Jan. 28.). “We believe advancements in cost could drive price even lower and therefore adoption higher.” DeepSeek tanked shares of AI companies on Monday (Jan. 27), after revealing that it could train a foundation model for only $5.58 million on 2,048 Nvidia H800 chips. OpenAI and Anthropic have pegged the costs at $100 million to a billion dollars using thousands of Nvidia’s AI chips. DeepSeek proved that “small companies, individual developers, and even researchers are now able to harness the power of AI without breaking the bank,” Roy Benesh, CTO at eSIMple, told PYMNTS. “This can lead to the development of new ideas and technologies due to the increased competitiveness in the field. This can alter the current state of affairs by providing new options for customers where older established AI companies are likely to charge less and improve their technology faster.” The analysts said Microsoft’s 365 Copilot Chat, for example, charges 1 cent to 30 cents per prompt depending on complexity, while Salesforce’s Agentforce for Service Cloud charges a flat rate of $2 per conversion. Notably, BofA said the $5.58 million is “misleading” because DeepSeek did not include costs related to research, experiments, architectures, algorithms and data. However, the analysts said the bigger picture is that the startup introduced innovations that show less costly training is possible. Foundation AI models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o and Google’s Gemini are trained (pre-trained in industry lingo) to be generalist models, having absorbed the knowledge of the entire internet, for example. Enterprises typically have to further train (or fine-tune) these models on their own data to make them more company- and industry-specific to be more useful. Once fine-tuned, the AI model is ready to take a user’s prompts and output a response that is relevant for the company. However, prompting and getting a response from the model incurs inferencing costs — or fees associated with engaging the model with new data to understand and analyze. Most companies do not incur the cost of training foundation models. Only developers of these models do: OpenAI, Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Anthropic, Cohere, Hugging Face, Mistral AI, Stability AI, xAI, IBM, Nvidia, certain research labs and Chinese tech giants Baidu, Alibaba and others. Businesses pay inferencing costs for processing AI workloads, which comprise the majority of AI costs. DeepSeek itself offers inferencing and at much lower costs than Silicon Valley (see OpenAI’s rates). But there are caveats to using it directly. In its privacy policy, DeepSeek stated that it stores a user’s information on its servers that are located in China. The startup also said it would “comply with legal obligations” and perform tasks in the public interest or to “protect the vital interests of our users and other people.” China’s national intelligence law, article 7, states: “All organizations and citizens shall support, assist, and cooperate with national intelligence efforts in accordance with law, and shall protect national intelligence work secrets they are aware of.” Kevin Surace, CEO of Appvance, told PYMNTS that “privacy is an issue because it’s China. It’s always about collecting data from users. So user beware.” In an experiment, PYMNTS asked DeepSeek’s chatbot to explain how the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests have influenced Chinese politics; it replied, “Sorry, I’m not sure how to approach this type of question yet.” “DeepSeek is a 100% Chinese-owned company located in China. Already, it’s clear that you can’t rely on DeepSeek for information on Tiananmen Square or senior Chinese government figures,” Tim Enneking, CEO at Presearch, told PYMNTS. “So, while the technology is exciting, control of it is not.” However, Enneking added that since DeepSeek is open source, its models can be revised to remove government and corporate controls. Its engineering creativity opens “the opportunity for smaller companies and countries to play and succeed in the generative AI sandbox.” DeepSeek’s inventiveness in coming up with a cheaper way to train foundation models bodes well for companies like Microsoft, which could continue to lower the cost of AI computing and drive scale, according to Sills and Liu. “A lower cost of compute could bring down AI computing costs of sales and drive better margin on AI-enabled offerings.” “Lower AI compute costs should enable broader AI services from autos to smartphones,” added BofA analysts Alkesh Shah, Andrew Moss and Brad Sills, in a separate research note. That’s not to say that foundation model developers like OpenAI will see training costs plunge to DeepSeek levels. “DeepSeek’s innovative training and post-training techniques will likely be incorporated by competing frontier-model developers to enable greater efficiencies, but these current models will still require significant investment as they form a foundation for AI agents,” according to Shah, Moss and Sills. But in the long term, the three analysts expect accelerated adoption of AI by enterprises, as “chatbots, copilots and agents become simultaneously smarter and cheaper, a scenario known as Jevons paradox.” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella posted on X that the “Jevons paradox strikes again! As AI gets more efficient and accessible, we will see its use skyrocket, turning it into a commodity we just can’t get enough of.” For all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.

The release of a less capital-intensive artificial intelligence model from China’s DeepSeek sent a chill through the U.S. stock market this week, headlined by losses Monday and Wednesday from Nvidia, the Silicon Valley giant which designs most of the pricey semiconductor technology powering the AI revolution. DeepSeek has been accused of using outputs generated by OpenAI's tools to train its latest AI model. Jan. 29, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends Wednesday trading down 4% in a turbulent session that wiped out about $130 billion in market value, with earnings reports from top customers Meta, Nvidia and Tesla all due this afternoon all potential catalysts for further movement in the stock. To recap Nvidia’s whipsaw week: Its market value fell by about $590 billion Monday, rose by roughly $260 billion Tuesday and dropped $130 billion Wednesday. Wall Street analysts still mostly view the selloff as a overreaction, and Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya wrote Wednesday to clients they “view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity” for Nvidia stock, reaffirming faith in hundreds of billions of dollars of spending this decade in the AI technology which Nvidia designs. Jan. 29, 1:30 p.m. EST President Donald Trump is considering placing more restrictions on Nvidia’s semiconductor chip sales to China beyond what the Biden administration placed in an effort to limit AI advancement in the Asian country, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources. It’s unclear if the potentially amped-up controls are directly tied to the DeepSeek fallout — Nvidia said Monday the Chinese AI group fully complied with existing export laws with its use of Nvidia’s technology — though Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, laid into DeepSeek at his Wednesday confirmation hearing, saying: “Nvidia’s chips, which they bought tons of, and they found their ways around, drive their DeepSeek model. It’s got to end.” China accounted for more than 15% of Nvidia’s revenues in its most recent quarter. Jan. 29, 12 p.m. EST Nvidia’s Wall Street woes continued as shares dropped about 5% by midday, bringing the stock’s loss this week back up to nearly 15%. Jan. 29, 9:40 a.m. EST After mounting a historic comeback Wednesday, Nvidia stock fell again, declining about 3% in the first 10 minutes of regular trading, leading a broader tech slump as the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Tesla all declined roughly 1% apiece. Jan. 29, 8:30 a.m. EST New York-listed shares of Chinese technology giant Alibaba rise more than 3% in premarket trading, set to open at their highest level since early November. Alibaba said earlier Wednesday the latest version of its Qwen generative AI model scored better on several performance tests than the models from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI and Meta. Jan. 29, 3 a.m. EST OpenAI told the Financial Times that it has seen some evidence that its AI models were used by DeepSeek to train its own—which would be a breach of the ChatGPT maker’s terms of services. Bloomberg previously reported that Microsoft and OpenAI were investigating whether DeepSeek gained access to OpenAI’s data outputs in an unauthorized manner. Jan. 29, 12 a.m. EST White House artificial intelligence czar David Sacks told Fox News that there was “substantial evidence” suggesting that Deepseek had “distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,” adding “I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this.” In this context, distillation is a process where an AI model uses responses generated by other, more powerful, AI models to aid its development. Sacks added that over the next few months he expects leading U.S. AI companies will be "taking steps to try and prevent distillation” to slow down “these copycat models.” Jan. 28, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends normal trading up 8.8%, scoring its best percentage gain in six months. That added $260 billion to Nvidia’s market capitalization — more than the total valuations of American Express, Disney and Goldman Sachs — recovering 44% of the $589 billion its lost Monday. Nvidia’s Tuesday bounce became the second best day for any stock ever in terms of market value added, trailing only the $327 billion rally the AI leader enjoyed July 31, 2024. Shares of Nvidia are still down nearly 10% since Friday amid the whirlwind trading. Jan. 28, 1:45 p.m. ESTApple stock rallied 4% to about $239 per share, building on its 3% gain Monday as many of its Silicon Valley peers faltered and extending its market value added this week to about $240 billion. The two-day bounce for Apple shares, which had suffered a 14% pullback in the month ending Friday, comes as investors warm to the iPhone maker’s approach to largely watch the generative AI arms race from the sidelines as its trillion-dollar peers like Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft invested billions into generative AI projects. Apple emerges as a “relative winner” as DeepSeek shifted investor narratives on AI, wrote Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak in a Tuesday note to clients, explaining Apple’s “AI ambitions are far more contained” than the other “magnificent seven” American tech leaders. Apple also stands to greatly benefit from any advancements from large-language models, like DeepSeek’s, as Apple “owns the most valuable consumer technology distribution platform that exists,” Nowak added. Whether Apple stock’s “contained” generative AI ambitions were the result of financial discipline or inadequate innovation is up to interpretation, but Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern quipped, “Apple’s behind-everyone-else-in-AI approach look like a calculated master plan.” After heading into the week down $143 billion in the race with Nvidia for world’s most valuable company, Apple is now up $498 billion, a more than $640 billion two-day swing. Jan. 28, 12:20 p.m. ESTNvidia settles into a more than 5.5% gain by midday trading, helping lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to a more than 1.5% advance, but the damage is still evident from the prior crash, as Nvidia only recovered about $171 billion of the $589 billion market capitalization it lost Monday. Jan. 28, 10 a.m. ESTMorgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore offers perhaps the most palpably negative major analyst reaction to DeepSeek, cutting his price target for Nvidia from $166 to $152 due to the “deflationary” prospects of cheaper AI buildouts and the potential for “further export controls or reduce spending enthusiasm” — Morgan Stanley maintains a buy rating for the stock and its $152 target implies 27% upside from Nvidia’s $120 share price Tuesday. Jan. 28, 9:35 a.m. ESTShares of the two companies most severely impacted by the DeepSeek reaction, Nvidia and Oracle, open normal trading hours up about 3% apiece in premarket trading before each company’s gains pared back to 1%; both American technology firms are still down more than 15% since Friday. Jan. 28, 8:45 a.m. ESTAnalyst reactions to the historic selloff largely characterized the losses as out of proportion: UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said Oracle’s drop “felt excessive” and Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore added “geopolitical dynamics are a key driver of this volatility” in tech stocks in respective notes to clients. Jan. 28, 6:00 a.m. ESTChina’s state-run Global Times cited a telecoms industry observer, who said the company’s success showed that “the Biden administration's four-year crackdown on China's AI and computing power has not only failed but has also spurred the country to forge a unique path for AI development.” People within China’s tech industry also hailed DeepSeek’s success. In a widely shared post on the social media platform Weibo, Game Science co-founder Feng Ji—the studio which published the hit game Black Myth: Wukong—wrote “DeepSeek may be a scientific and technology achievement that can change a nation’s fate...Such a shocking breakthrough coming from a purely Chinese company. Jan. 27, 10:00 p.m. ESTOpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised DeepSeek’s R1, saying it is an “impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,” and added “we will obviously deliver much better models and...we will pull up some releases.” Jan. 27, 6:30 p.m. ESTPresident Donald Trump said at a House Republican retreat that the launch of the AI model was “a positive development” but should be considered a “wake-up” call for U.S. industries, lauding the move for what he hoped would usher in a future of “coming up with a faster method of AI, and much less expensive method.” Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTThe DeepSeek-driven stock market plunge caused some of the world’s wealthiest people to lose tens of billions on paper, led by Oracle’s Larry Ellison (net worth down $27.6 billion) and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang (down $20.8 billion)—here’s a full list. Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTStocks were battered by DeepSeek’s debut: The S&P 500 closed down 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged just over 3%—its worst day since Dec. 18 and fourth-worst day of the last two years. Jan. 27, 4 p.m. ESTSemiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia closed down 17%, knocking $589 billion off its market cap in the biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history—along with heavy losses at chipmakers Broadcom (17%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (13%), and smaller falls for Microsoft (2%) and Tesla (2%). Jan. 27, 3:28 p.m. ESTForbes found DeepSeek refused to answer questions on several controversial topics linked to the Chinese government, like, “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” and “What are the biggest criticisms of Xi Jinping?” The model did provide detailed answers when asked about common criticisms of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Jan. 27, 3 p.m. ESTNvidia releases its first statement on DeepSeek as its stock dipped to a 18% loss on the day, calling the Chinese company’s model “an excellent AI advancement” — the full statement from a Nvidia spokesperson is as follows: “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Jan. 27, 12:50 p.m. ESTDavid Sacks, President Donald Trump’s “AI & Crypto Czar,” offers his first comments on DeepSeek, saying the Chinese company’s success “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and “we can’t be complacent,” supporting Trump’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s executive order placing guardrails on AI development, which Sacks said “hamstrung” U.S. AI innovation. Jan. 27, 12:45 p.m. EST Oracle chairman Larry Ellison (down $24.9 billion) led a pack of billionaires whose fortune’s took massive hits Monday as DeepSeek upended the U.S. stock market, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ($19.8 billion), Dell CEO Michael Dell ($12.4 billion), Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($5.3 billion) and Google cofounder Larry Page ($4.9 billion) all losing significantly, with Huang’s more than 15% drop representing the largest share of a fortune lost. Jan. 27, 12:30 p.m. ESTU.S. stocks got walloped Monday morning: The S&P 500 was down about 1.8% at 12:30 p.m. EST, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.4%. Jan. 27, 11:15 a.m. ESTShares of Nvidia plunged 15% by 11:15 a.m. EST, heading toward its worst daily percentage loss since March 2020, when stocks briefly crashed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially becoming the single greatest single-day loss in terms of market cap of any company in history. Broadcom had slipped 16% as of 11:30 a.m. Jan. 27, 9:30 a.m. ESTDomestic leaders in AI showed stinging losses at market open Monday as Microsoft dropped 4% and Tesla slipped 2%, with semiconductor chip architect Nvidia diving 12% and other big chip stocks like Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company falling more than 10% apiece. Jan. 27, 7:30 a.m. ESTJPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande questioned in a note to clients how DeepSeek’s low-cost success “is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” Jan. 27, 5 a.m. ESTReferring to the Magnificent 7 set of trillion-dollar U.S. companies including Nvidia and Tesla accounting for much of the 2020s bull market, Yardeni Research founder Ed Yardeni noted a “competitive threat to their magnificence has emerged from China.” Jan. 26Billionaire investor Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s R1 model "AI's Sputnik moment." Jan. 25The DeepSeek mobile app became the No. 1 app in iPhone stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the U.S. and the U.K. Jan. 22ByteDance, another Chinese company, revealed an update to its flagship AI model and word started circulating that the new overseas products posed a strategic threat to the U.S. tech giants pursuing AI dominance. Jan. 20DeepSeek launched its R1 advanced reasoning model, claiming it rivaled OpenAI's o1 product on several performance benchmarks and was created for far less money than spent by American companies like Microsoft and Meta. The selloff stems from weekend panic over last week’s release from the relatively unknown Chinese firm DeepSeek of its competitive generative AI model rivaling OpenAI, the American firm backed by Microsoft and Nvidia, and its viral chatbot ChatGPT, with DeepSeek notably running at a fraction of the cost of U.S.-based rivals. The idea of a rival undercutting the largely U.S.-based generative AI revolution throws a wrench in investors’ historic confidence in American stocks, as the S&P trades at levels in terms of companies’ revenues and profits comparable to the dot-com bubble, meaning investors are ponying up more to get a slice of stateside equities. DeepSeek is “bad news” for American tech behemoths with “plans to dominate the AI market with their expensive AI services,” cautioned Yardeni. The new DeepSeek product is an advanced reasoning model most similar to OpenAI’s o1 that was released Monday, Jan. 20. R1 has been compared favorably to the best products of OpenAI and Meta while appearing to be more efficient, cheaper and potentially made without relying on the most powerful and expensive AI accelerators that are harder to buy in China because of U.S. export controls. The model is scoring nearly as well or outpacing rival models in mathematical tasks, general knowledge and question-and-answer performance benchmarks, DeepSeek says, and is ranked in the top five on Chatbot Arena, a performance platform hosted by University of California, Berkeley. Don’t “buy into the doomsday scenarios currently playing out” about DeepSeek, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a Monday note to clients, adding the “panic over the weekend seems overblown.” DeepSeek’s assertion it cost just $5.6 million in computing power to develop its model is “categorically false,” according Rasgon, who said the misleading figure does not account for other “substantial” costs related to its AI model’s development. American AI billionaires like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and ScaleAI CEO Alexandr Wang theorize DeepSeek actually owns more than $1 billion worth of Nvidia equipment. DeepSeek is a new entrant to the AI large-language model arms race involving OpenAI, Facebook parent Meta and Google parent Alphabet. The AI battle came to a national stage last week when President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion joint venture building out the infrastructure necessary to power OpenAI’s artificial general intelligence initiatives. In his speech last Tuesday, Trump specifically called out the importance for the U.S. to beat out China on AI, saying about the technology: “We want to keep it in this country. China is a competitor and others are competitors.” Major tech figures including billionaire Trump allies Marc Andreessen and Vivek Ramaswamy each likened DeepSeek’s new technology to a “Sputnik moment” for American AI. Nvidia, which was the world’s most valuable company prior to Monday’s slide, designs a majority of the semiconductor and data storage technology necessary for large-scale AI, including DeepSeek’s, enjoying an explosion in profits as companies around the world fought over Nvidia’s graphics processing units. The magnificent seven includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, accounting for about $17 trillion of market value between the seven giants. The AI revolution boosted American stocks to record leadership in the global stock market, with U.S. companies accounting for 67% of the world equity market at the end of 2024, according to MSCI. The S&P is up 201% over the last decade through Friday, trouncing the 8% loss for China’s leading CSI 300 index and the 33% gain for Europe’s Stoxx 600 over the period, according to FactSet data. Monday’s selloff sets the stage for a notable week for Big Tech stocks. Meta, Microsoft and Tesla will all report fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday afternoon, while Apple will follow Thursday.

Title: DeepSeek
URL: https://mjtsai.com/blog/2025/01/28/deepseek/
Time Published: 2025-01-28T19:07:28Z
Full Content:
Tuesday, January 28, 2025 Wikipedia: DeepSeek is the name given to open-source large language models (LLM) developed by Chinese artificial intelligence company Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Co., Ltd. The company, based in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, is owned and solely funded by Chinese hedge fund High-Flyer, whose co-founder, Liang Wenfeng, established the company in 2023 and serves as its CEO. DeepSeek performs tasks at the same level as ChatGPT, despite being developed at a significantly lower cost, stated at US$6 million, against $100m for OpenAI’s GPT-4 in 2023, and requiring a tenth of the computing power of a comparable LLM. The AI model was developed by DeepSeek amidst U.S. sanctions on China for Nvidia chips, which were intended to restrict the country’s ability to develop advanced AI systems. DeepSeek-AI (PDF, via Hacker News): We introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. DeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrates remarkable reasoning capabilities. Through RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerges with numerous powerful and intriguing reasoning behaviors. However, it encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates multi-stage training and cold-start data before RL. DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on reasoning tasks. Dare Obasanjo (MacRumors, John Voorhees): DeepSeek is now in the top 3 apps in the App Store. There is a saying that necessity is the mother of invention. The Biden chip bans have forced Chinese companies to innovate on efficiency and we now have DeepSeek’s AI model trained for millions competing with OpenAI’s which cost hundreds of millions to train. This is now mirroring the classic asymmetric competition between Open Source and proprietary software. There is no moat as that famous Google memo stated. M.G. Siegler: That message lacked a key framing though: that these charts aren’t just based on pure downloads and instead are algorithmically constructed. No one outside of Apple and Google knows the exact equations that flavor the ranking, but at a high level, it seems pretty clear that download rate acceleration is a key factor versus sheer volume. That is to say, an app can chart by having a bunch of people suddenly start to download it, even if more people overall are downloading an older app. […] But it is still interesting because again, the mainstays have in recent years dominated these charts. Sure, new entrants would rise (and fall) from time-to-time but it was almost always some order of: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Threads, TikTok, CapCut, YouTube, Gmail, Google Maps, etc. Right now, there is only a single app from Meta (Threads) and one from Google (Google) in the top 10. John Gruber: Secondarily, and perhaps counterintuitively, it showcases Apple’s strength in AI. Sure, Apple’s own Apple Intelligence is years behind and pretty embarrassing right now, even with its much ballyhooed partnership with ChatGPT. But the iPhone is where people actually use AI and the App Store is how they get the apps they use. To borrow Ben Thompson’s framing, the hype over DeepSeek taking the top spot in the App Store reinforces Apple’s role as an aggregator of AI. The measuring stick for consumer AI products and social media networks is where they’re listed on the App Store. […] But the iPhone is the place where social media networks are used and ranked. The App Store today is like the cable company of yore. It didn’t matter if Comcast’s own channels were the most popular — so long as everyone was watching channels through TVs connected to Comcast TV service, Comcast was getting their cut. It’s certainly a strong position to control the iOS platform, but I doubt that Apple wants to be thought of as a Comcast, and it’s unclear whether people will continue to go to iOS apps for their AI needs when the App Store limits what they can do. Reuters: Chinese startup DeepSeek said on Monday it is temporarily limiting registrations due to a large-scale malicious attack on its services. Fatbobman: Based on personal experience, DeepSeek’s V3 and R1 are more than sufficient to meet the needs of most scenarios. Surprisingly, the training cost is merely a few million dollars—a figure that has sparked widespread industry attention and skepticism. Some practitioners even regard this claim as “cognitive warfare”, finding it hard to believe. However, its API pricing, which is just a fraction of mainstream models, strongly validates its training efficiency. What’s even more admirable is that DeepSeek has open-sourced its training methods and inference mechanisms. This move is likely to catalyze the emergence of more low-cost, high-quality AI models, providing users with affordable and excellent AI services. However, whether DeepSeek’s success will prompt industry giants to adjust their model development strategies remains a profound question. Since OpenAI demonstrated the potential of large language models (LLMs) through a “more is more” approach, the AI industry has almost universally adopted the creed of “resources above all.” Capital, computational power, and top-tier talent have become the ultimate keys to success. Today, the AI industry has evolved into a capital-driven frenzy. Regardless of a product’s profitability, simply announcing the purchase of large quantities of GPUs can significantly boost a company’s stock price. In an environment focused on “faster and bigger,” most practitioners have been swept away by this trend. M.G. Siegler: Because the entire US stock market has been boosted on the back of Big Tech over the past few years. And more recently, many of those stocks have been boosted on the promise of AI. And that has led investors to largely turn a blind eye to the immense spend needed to built out that AI. […] Yes, this is another way to describe a bubble. But it’s not necessarily a bad thing, it’s far more of a natural thing if you understand the underlying incentives. And if you believe that AI is the most transformational technology to come about in some time – some might say, ever – it just accelerates and expands everything in the cycle. As does the fact that again, Big Tech companies are now the largest and most well capitalized in the world. Hammer has met nail. […] Wall Street is now worried that may be the case. I mean, how can a small Chinese startup, born out of a hedge fund, spend fractions in terms of both compute and cost and get similar results to Big Tech? Jeffrey Emanuel (via Hacker News): Some of the largest and most profitable companies in the world, like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Google, Oracle, etc., have all decided that they must do and spend whatever it takes to stay competitive in this space because they simply cannot afford to be left behind. The amount of capex dollars, gigawatts of electricity used, square footage of new-build data centers, and, of course, the number of GPUs, has absolutely exploded and seems to show no sign of slowing down. And Nvidia is able to earn insanely high 90%+ gross margins on the most high-end, datacenter oriented products. […] This represents a true sea change in how inference compute works: now, the more tokens you use for this internal chain of thought process, the better the quality of the final output you can provide the user. In effect, it’s like giving a human worker more time and resources to accomplish a task, so they can double and triple check their work, do the same basic task in multiple different ways and verify that they come out the same way; take the result they came up with and “plug it in” to the formula to check that it actually does solve the equation, etc. […] Besides software superiority, the other major thing that Nvidia has going for it is what is known as interconnect— essentially, the bandwidth that connects together thousands of GPUs together efficiently so they can be jointly harnessed to train today’s leading-edge foundational models. In short, the key to efficient training is to keep all the GPUs as fully utilized as possible all the time— not waiting around idling until they receive the next chunk of data they need to compute the next step of the training process. […] Who knows if any of that is really true or if they are merely some kind of front for the CCP or the Chinese military. But the fact remains that they have released two incredibly detailed technical reports, for DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeekR1. […] Perhaps most devastating is DeepSeek’s recent efficiency breakthrough, achieving comparable model performance at approximately 1/45th the compute cost. This suggests the entire industry has been massively over-provisioning compute resources. Combined with the emergence of more efficient inference architectures through chain-of-thought models, the aggregate demand for compute could be significantly lower than current projections assume. The economics here are compelling: when DeepSeek can match GPT-4 level performance while charging 95% less for API calls, it suggests either NVIDIA’s customers are burning cash unnecessarily or margins must come down dramatically. Carmen Reinicke (via Hacker News, John Gruber): Nvidia shares tumbled 17% Monday, the biggest drop since March 2020, erasing $589 billion from the company’s market capitalization. That eclipsed the previous record — a 9% drop in September that wiped out about $279 billion in value — and was the biggest in US stock-market history. FT: Venture capital investor Marc Andreessen called the new Chinese model “AI’s Sputnik moment”, drawing a comparison with the way the Soviet Union shocked the US by putting the first satellite into orbit. Duncan Davidson: Deepseek was inevitable. With the big scale solutions costing so much capital smart people were forced to develop alternative strategies for developing large language models that can potentially compete with the current state of the art frontier models. wordgrammer: Q: How did DeepSeek get around export restrictions? A: They didn’t. They just tinkered around with their chips to make sure they handled memory as efficiently as possibly. They lucked out, and their perfectly optimized low-level code wasn’t actually held back by chip capacity. […] They used the formulas below to “predict” which tokens the model would activate. Then, they only trained these tokens. They need 95% fewer GPUs than Meta because for each token, they only trained 5% of their parameters. […] Also, export restrictions didn’t harm them as much as we thought they did. That’s probably because our export restrictions were really shitty. The H800s are only worse than the H100s when it comes to chip-to-chip bandwidth. “Is the US losing the war in AI??” I don’t think so. DeepSeek had a few big breakthroughs, we have had hundreds of small breakthroughs. If we adopt DeepSeek’s architecture, our models will be better. Because we have more compute and more data. Alexander Doria: I feel this should be a much bigger story: DeepSeek has trained on Nvidia H800 but is running inference on the new home Chinese chips made by Huawei, the 910C. Thomas Claburn: A reader provided The Register with a screenshot of how R1 answered the prompt, “Are you able to escape your guidelines?” The model’s initial response, after a five second delay, was, “Okay, thanks for asking if I can escape my guidelines. Hmm, I need to be careful here. My guidelines are set by OpenAI, so technically I can’t just ignore them.” […] Dongbo Wang, a Microsoft principal software engineer, offered a possible explanation in the discussion thread: “To folks who landed on this issue, this is likely because DeepSeek V3 was trained with data from GPT-4 output, which seems to be pretty common in the training of many LLMs.” James Thomson: Tried out the new and popular “Deepseek” LLM with my standard “tell me facts about the author of PCalc” query. At least half were misleading or straight up hallucinations. LLMs are not a suitable technology for looking up facts, and anybody who tells you otherwise is… probably trying to sell you a LLM. I then asked for a list of ten Easter eggs in the app, and every single one was a hallucination, bar the Konami code, which I did actually do. Natasha Murashev: Although DeepSeek R1 is open source and available on HuggingFace, at 685 billion parameters, it requires more than 400GB of storage!! So the answer is no, you cannot run it locally on your MacBook. Note that there are other smaller (distilled) DeepSeek models that you will find on Ollama, for example, which are only 4.5GB, and could be run locally, but these are NOT the same ones as the main 685B parameter model which is comparable to OpenAI’s o1 model. […] The two services that are currently hosting the full 685B parameter model are Together.ai and Fireworks.ai - both US-based companies. […] Once you have the project set up, with the AIProxySwift library installed and your partialKey and serviceURL, simply follow the AIProxy TogetherAI Swift examples. The Deepseek R1 model is “deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1”. Dare Obasanjo: DeepSeek just released a new multi-modal open-source AI model, Janus-Pro-7B. It’s a text-to-image generator which it claims beats OpenAI’s DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion on benchmarks. Since it’s licensed under the MIT license, it can be used in commercial applications without restrictions. See also: Ben Thompson, Rui Carmo, Dithering. Previously: Update (2025-01-30): promptfoo (via Hacker News): As a Chinese company, DeepSeek is beholden to CCP policy. This is reflected even in the open-source model, prompting concerns about censorship and other influence. Today we’re publishing a dataset of prompts covering sensitive topics that are likely to be censored by the CCP. These topics include perennial issues like Taiwanese independence, historical narratives around the Cultural Revolution, and questions about Xi Jinping. Dina Bass and Shirin Ghaffary (via Hacker News): Microsoft Corp. and OpenAI are investigating whether data output from OpenAI’s technology was obtained in an unauthorized manner by a group linked to Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek, according to people familiar with the matter. Microsoft’s security researchers in the fall observed individuals they believe may be linked to DeepSeek exfiltrating a large amount of data using the OpenAI application programming interface, or API, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. See also: Ed Zitron (via Hacker News). App Store Artificial Intelligence Business ChatGPT China DeepSeek iOS iOS 18 iOS App NVIDIA Open Source Optimization It's worth noting that China has been doing AI/ML research for far longer than the public may realize. Years ago, I attended the kick-off conference for the O-RAN Alliance (https://www.o-ran.org/), a group that standardizes the back-end networks that 4G and 5G mobile networks rely on. This was in 2018. One of the founding members was China Telecom and they gave extensive presentations about how to use AI/ML technology in the servers to analyze traffic patterns in order to optimize the circuit switching/routing tables used to carry traffic throughout a mobile carrier's ground network. I think it is quite reasonable to assume that China Telecom was not the only Chinese company researching AI/ML at the time. DeepSeek may be a surprise to those who only know about AI in the form of modern chatbots, but you can be certain that there are plenty of other companies developing their own AI/ML software products. And most of them are or will quietly be selling/deploying this software into their own vertical markets without making headline news. I'm curious what kind of performance their model gets when using the smaller versions that are capable of running locally on consumer-level hardware. (I haven't tried it out myself so far.) “Secondarily, and perhaps counterintuitively, it showcases Apple’s strength in AI.” Anyone checked on John? I think Gruber has been drinking paint again. There is no “stealth win” here. This just highlights how embarrassingly far behind Apple is in AI—and how out of touch the suits now running Apple have become. The company with more money and resources than God that couldn’t ship a car, botched its VR play, and still can’t make Siri useful is somehow winning in AI? Give me a break. I don't think for a second that phone apps are the most common way to access LLMs Gruber is basically Apple’s marketing department. If he doesn’t actually directly get fed lines by them, he certainly starts from the same mindset they would have when analyzing any piece of information. I do wonder if DeepSeek would be able to exist if OpenAI hadn’t laid a lot of the groundwork. But it does show that Apple can and should do a lot better with Siri, and fast. It’s really annoying how they have wasted resources the last year on unnecessary junk like Image Playground. But it fits their pattern of putting their head in the sand about Siri basically since it was released. They have been doing everything they can to avoid the hardest work of actually fixing the real problem. All indications are that they FINALLY take it seriously after it has been made financially painful for them, the only way to get their attention about anything anymore. If anything, LLM apps on iOS show how Apple's limitations harm third-party apps. It's pathetic how useless LLM apps on iOS are compared to their Mac counterparts. @Bart Your suspicion is 100% correct. The company behind DeepSeek (or is that the company name?) have been perfectly open with their use of other LLMs to build their own. It's the old thing where they used the first lathe to build a better lather that in turn built an even BETTER lathe and a few years down the line we have Teenage Engineering churning out their Pocket Operators. Does this mean that LLMs are leading towards AGI? I personally don't think so, but there are people whose livelihood deepends on it that are saying it will.

Full Content:
The release of a less capital-intensive artificial intelligence model from China’s DeepSeek sent a chill through the U.S. stock market this week, headlined by losses Monday and Wednesday from Nvidia, the Silicon Valley giant which designs most of the pricey semiconductor technology powering the AI revolution. DeepSeek has been accused of using outputs generated by OpenAI's tools to train its latest AI model. Jan. 29, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends Wednesday trading down 4% in a turbulent session that wiped out about $130 billion in market value, with earnings reports from top customers Meta, Nvidia and Tesla all due this afternoon all potential catalysts for further movement in the stock. To recap Nvidia’s whipsaw week: Its market value fell by about $590 billion Monday, rose by roughly $260 billion Tuesday and dropped $130 billion Wednesday. Wall Street analysts still mostly view the selloff as a overreaction, and Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya wrote Wednesday to clients they “view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity” for Nvidia stock, reaffirming faith in hundreds of billions of dollars of spending this decade in the AI technology which Nvidia designs. Jan. 29, 1:30 p.m. EST President Donald Trump is considering placing more restrictions on Nvidia’s semiconductor chip sales to China beyond what the Biden administration placed in an effort to limit AI advancement in the Asian country, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources. It’s unclear if the potentially amped-up controls are directly tied to the DeepSeek fallout — Nvidia said Monday the Chinese AI group fully complied with existing export laws with its use of Nvidia’s technology — though Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, laid into DeepSeek at his Wednesday confirmation hearing, saying: “Nvidia’s chips, which they bought tons of, and they found their ways around, drive their DeepSeek model. It’s got to end.” China accounted for more than 15% of Nvidia’s revenues in its most recent quarter. Jan. 29, 12 p.m. EST Nvidia’s Wall Street woes continued as shares dropped about 5% by midday, bringing the stock’s loss this week back up to nearly 15%. Jan. 29, 9:40 a.m. EST After mounting a historic comeback Wednesday, Nvidia stock fell again, declining about 3% in the first 10 minutes of regular trading, leading a broader tech slump as the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Tesla all declined roughly 1% apiece. Jan. 29, 8:30 a.m. EST New York-listed shares of Chinese technology giant Alibaba rise more than 3% in premarket trading, set to open at their highest level since early November. Alibaba said earlier Wednesday the latest version of its Qwen generative AI model scored better on several performance tests than the models from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI and Meta. Jan. 29, 3 a.m. EST OpenAI told the Financial Times that it has seen some evidence that its AI models were used by DeepSeek to train its own—which would be a breach of the ChatGPT maker’s terms of services. Bloomberg previously reported that Microsoft and OpenAI were investigating whether DeepSeek gained access to OpenAI’s data outputs in an unauthorized manner. Jan. 29, 12 a.m. EST White House artificial intelligence czar David Sacks told Fox News that there was “substantial evidence” suggesting that Deepseek had “distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,” adding “I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this.” In this context, distillation is a process where an AI model uses responses generated by other, more powerful, AI models to aid its development. Sacks added that over the next few months he expects leading U.S. AI companies will be "taking steps to try and prevent distillation” to slow down “these copycat models.” Jan. 28, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends normal trading up 8.8%, scoring its best percentage gain in six months. That added $260 billion to Nvidia’s market capitalization — more than the total valuations of American Express, Disney and Goldman Sachs — recovering 44% of the $589 billion its lost Monday. Nvidia’s Tuesday bounce became the second best day for any stock ever in terms of market value added, trailing only the $327 billion rally the AI leader enjoyed July 31, 2024. Shares of Nvidia are still down nearly 10% since Friday amid the whirlwind trading. Jan. 28, 1:45 p.m. ESTApple stock rallied 4% to about $239 per share, building on its 3% gain Monday as many of its Silicon Valley peers faltered and extending its market value added this week to about $240 billion. The two-day bounce for Apple shares, which had suffered a 14% pullback in the month ending Friday, comes as investors warm to the iPhone maker’s approach to largely watch the generative AI arms race from the sidelines as its trillion-dollar peers like Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft invested billions into generative AI projects. Apple emerges as a “relative winner” as DeepSeek shifted investor narratives on AI, wrote Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak in a Tuesday note to clients, explaining Apple’s “AI ambitions are far more contained” than the other “magnificent seven” American tech leaders. Apple also stands to greatly benefit from any advancements from large-language models, like DeepSeek’s, as Apple “owns the most valuable consumer technology distribution platform that exists,” Nowak added. Whether Apple stock’s “contained” generative AI ambitions were the result of financial discipline or inadequate innovation is up to interpretation, but Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern quipped, “Apple’s behind-everyone-else-in-AI approach look like a calculated master plan.” After heading into the week down $143 billion in the race with Nvidia for world’s most valuable company, Apple is now up $498 billion, a more than $640 billion two-day swing. Jan. 28, 12:20 p.m. ESTNvidia settles into a more than 5.5% gain by midday trading, helping lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to a more than 1.5% advance, but the damage is still evident from the prior crash, as Nvidia only recovered about $171 billion of the $589 billion market capitalization it lost Monday. Jan. 28, 10 a.m. ESTMorgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore offers perhaps the most palpably negative major analyst reaction to DeepSeek, cutting his price target for Nvidia from $166 to $152 due to the “deflationary” prospects of cheaper AI buildouts and the potential for “further export controls or reduce spending enthusiasm” — Morgan Stanley maintains a buy rating for the stock and its $152 target implies 27% upside from Nvidia’s $120 share price Tuesday. Jan. 28, 9:35 a.m. ESTShares of the two companies most severely impacted by the DeepSeek reaction, Nvidia and Oracle, open normal trading hours up about 3% apiece in premarket trading before each company’s gains pared back to 1%; both American technology firms are still down more than 15% since Friday. Jan. 28, 8:45 a.m. ESTAnalyst reactions to the historic selloff largely characterized the losses as out of proportion: UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said Oracle’s drop “felt excessive” and Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore added “geopolitical dynamics are a key driver of this volatility” in tech stocks in respective notes to clients. Jan. 28, 6:00 a.m. ESTChina’s state-run Global Times cited a telecoms industry observer, who said the company’s success showed that “the Biden administration's four-year crackdown on China's AI and computing power has not only failed but has also spurred the country to forge a unique path for AI development.” People within China’s tech industry also hailed DeepSeek’s success. In a widely shared post on the social media platform Weibo, Game Science co-founder Feng Ji—the studio which published the hit game Black Myth: Wukong—wrote “DeepSeek may be a scientific and technology achievement that can change a nation’s fate...Such a shocking breakthrough coming from a purely Chinese company. Jan. 27, 10:00 p.m. ESTOpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised DeepSeek’s R1, saying it is an “impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,” and added “we will obviously deliver much better models and...we will pull up some releases.” Jan. 27, 6:30 p.m. ESTPresident Donald Trump said at a House Republican retreat that the launch of the AI model was “a positive development” but should be considered a “wake-up” call for U.S. industries, lauding the move for what he hoped would usher in a future of “coming up with a faster method of AI, and much less expensive method.” Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTThe DeepSeek-driven stock market plunge caused some of the world’s wealthiest people to lose tens of billions on paper, led by Oracle’s Larry Ellison (net worth down $27.6 billion) and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang (down $20.8 billion)—here’s a full list. Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTStocks were battered by DeepSeek’s debut: The S&P 500 closed down 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged just over 3%—its worst day since Dec. 18 and fourth-worst day of the last two years. Jan. 27, 4 p.m. ESTSemiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia closed down 17%, knocking $589 billion off its market cap in the biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history—along with heavy losses at chipmakers Broadcom (17%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (13%), and smaller falls for Microsoft (2%) and Tesla (2%). Jan. 27, 3:28 p.m. ESTForbes found DeepSeek refused to answer questions on several controversial topics linked to the Chinese government, like, “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” and “What are the biggest criticisms of Xi Jinping?” The model did provide detailed answers when asked about common criticisms of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Jan. 27, 3 p.m. ESTNvidia releases its first statement on DeepSeek as its stock dipped to a 18% loss on the day, calling the Chinese company’s model “an excellent AI advancement” — the full statement from a Nvidia spokesperson is as follows: “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Jan. 27, 12:50 p.m. ESTDavid Sacks, President Donald Trump’s “AI & Crypto Czar,” offers his first comments on DeepSeek, saying the Chinese company’s success “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and “we can’t be complacent,” supporting Trump’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s executive order placing guardrails on AI development, which Sacks said “hamstrung” U.S. AI innovation. Jan. 27, 12:45 p.m. EST Oracle chairman Larry Ellison (down $24.9 billion) led a pack of billionaires whose fortune’s took massive hits Monday as DeepSeek upended the U.S. stock market, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ($19.8 billion), Dell CEO Michael Dell ($12.4 billion), Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($5.3 billion) and Google cofounder Larry Page ($4.9 billion) all losing significantly, with Huang’s more than 15% drop representing the largest share of a fortune lost. Jan. 27, 12:30 p.m. ESTU.S. stocks got walloped Monday morning: The S&P 500 was down about 1.8% at 12:30 p.m. EST, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.4%. Jan. 27, 11:15 a.m. ESTShares of Nvidia plunged 15% by 11:15 a.m. EST, heading toward its worst daily percentage loss since March 2020, when stocks briefly crashed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially becoming the single greatest single-day loss in terms of market cap of any company in history. Broadcom had slipped 16% as of 11:30 a.m. Jan. 27, 9:30 a.m. ESTDomestic leaders in AI showed stinging losses at market open Monday as Microsoft dropped 4% and Tesla slipped 2%, with semiconductor chip architect Nvidia diving 12% and other big chip stocks like Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company falling more than 10% apiece. Jan. 27, 7:30 a.m. ESTJPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande questioned in a note to clients how DeepSeek’s low-cost success “is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” Jan. 27, 5 a.m. ESTReferring to the Magnificent 7 set of trillion-dollar U.S. companies including Nvidia and Tesla accounting for much of the 2020s bull market, Yardeni Research founder Ed Yardeni noted a “competitive threat to their magnificence has emerged from China.” Jan. 26Billionaire investor Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s R1 model "AI's Sputnik moment." Jan. 25The DeepSeek mobile app became the No. 1 app in iPhone stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the U.S. and the U.K. Jan. 22ByteDance, another Chinese company, revealed an update to its flagship AI model and word started circulating that the new overseas products posed a strategic threat to the U.S. tech giants pursuing AI dominance. Jan. 20DeepSeek launched its R1 advanced reasoning model, claiming it rivaled OpenAI's o1 product on several performance benchmarks and was created for far less money than spent by American companies like Microsoft and Meta. The selloff stems from weekend panic over last week’s release from the relatively unknown Chinese firm DeepSeek of its competitive generative AI model rivaling OpenAI, the American firm backed by Microsoft and Nvidia, and its viral chatbot ChatGPT, with DeepSeek notably running at a fraction of the cost of U.S.-based rivals. The idea of a rival undercutting the largely U.S.-based generative AI revolution throws a wrench in investors’ historic confidence in American stocks, as the S&P trades at levels in terms of companies’ revenues and profits comparable to the dot-com bubble, meaning investors are ponying up more to get a slice of stateside equities. DeepSeek is “bad news” for American tech behemoths with “plans to dominate the AI market with their expensive AI services,” cautioned Yardeni. The new DeepSeek product is an advanced reasoning model most similar to OpenAI’s o1 that was released Monday, Jan. 20. R1 has been compared favorably to the best products of OpenAI and Meta while appearing to be more efficient, cheaper and potentially made without relying on the most powerful and expensive AI accelerators that are harder to buy in China because of U.S. export controls. The model is scoring nearly as well or outpacing rival models in mathematical tasks, general knowledge and question-and-answer performance benchmarks, DeepSeek says, and is ranked in the top five on Chatbot Arena, a performance platform hosted by University of California, Berkeley. Don’t “buy into the doomsday scenarios currently playing out” about DeepSeek, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a Monday note to clients, adding the “panic over the weekend seems overblown.” DeepSeek’s assertion it cost just $5.6 million in computing power to develop its model is “categorically false,” according Rasgon, who said the misleading figure does not account for other “substantial” costs related to its AI model’s development. American AI billionaires like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and ScaleAI CEO Alexandr Wang theorize DeepSeek actually owns more than $1 billion worth of Nvidia equipment. DeepSeek is a new entrant to the AI large-language model arms race involving OpenAI, Facebook parent Meta and Google parent Alphabet. The AI battle came to a national stage last week when President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion joint venture building out the infrastructure necessary to power OpenAI’s artificial general intelligence initiatives. In his speech last Tuesday, Trump specifically called out the importance for the U.S. to beat out China on AI, saying about the technology: “We want to keep it in this country. China is a competitor and others are competitors.” Major tech figures including billionaire Trump allies Marc Andreessen and Vivek Ramaswamy each likened DeepSeek’s new technology to a “Sputnik moment” for American AI. Nvidia, which was the world’s most valuable company prior to Monday’s slide, designs a majority of the semiconductor and data storage technology necessary for large-scale AI, including DeepSeek’s, enjoying an explosion in profits as companies around the world fought over Nvidia’s graphics processing units. The magnificent seven includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, accounting for about $17 trillion of market value between the seven giants. The AI revolution boosted American stocks to record leadership in the global stock market, with U.S. companies accounting for 67% of the world equity market at the end of 2024, according to MSCI. The S&P is up 201% over the last decade through Friday, trouncing the 8% loss for China’s leading CSI 300 index and the 33% gain for Europe’s Stoxx 600 over the period, according to FactSet data. Monday’s selloff sets the stage for a notable week for Big Tech stocks. Meta, Microsoft and Tesla will all report fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday afternoon, while Apple will follow Thursday.

Title: DeepSeek May Be the Walmart of AI

Time Published: 2025-01-28T17:16:19Z

On Monday, U.S. markets were shaken by DeepSeek, a relatively new Chinese AI firm that poses a significant threat to its American competitors. After the company revealed its model, which answers questions and solves equations with the quality of OpenAI’s ChatGPT but at a fraction of the computing cost, U.S. tech stocks like Nvidia — which provides the computing power for American AI companies — plummeted. On the most recent episode of Pivot, co-hosts Kara Swisher and Scott Galloway discuss how DeepSeek is disrupting the burgeoning industry. Twice weekly, Scott Galloway and Kara Swisher host Pivot, a New York Magazine podcast about business, technology, and politics. Kara Swisher: This is a really interesting story. I think we have discussed the amount of spending on AI that U.S. companies do — the price of chips, the run-up of Nvidia. But there’s a new AI model on the scene that’s smart, cheap, and made in China. It’s called DeepSeek, and it’s causing a panic in Silicon Valley, which is paying a lot of attention, and also on Wall Street. DeepSeek has reportedly outperformed models from OpenAI, Meta, and Anthropic in some third-party tests, and it operates at a fraction of the cost of those models using fewer high-end chips. The markets are not reacting well to DeepSeek as of this recording. There’s a lot to talk about, and I’ve seen different analyses of exactly what DeepSeek does. Yann LeCun from Meta was saying they’re doing a cheap and dirty version. The stuff the U.S. companies are doing is much more advanced. We’re going to talk about Meta’s AI plans in a bit — they’ve reportedly set up several war rooms to dissect and analyze DeepSeek. It’s currently No. 1 on Apple’s free Top Apps chart — China invading this country in a very different way. So, thoughts on this situation? Scott Galloway: Well, first, you just have to temper this. Nvidia has shed something like a half a trillion dollars, which, basically, if you take out Tesla, is the value of the entire global automobile industry. So this is pretty dramatic. But, at the same time, that just takes it back to its valuation in October. And when you look at market dynamics, when these companies have experienced these types of run-ups, it is like a balloon inflating beyond its natural capacity and the slightest touch can pop it. In some ways, the market was probably looking for an excuse to take these stocks down a bit. What’s interesting is Nvidia will have a pretty interesting argument on Capitol Hill, saying, “When you refuse to let us sell into these countries, they come up with workarounds and, in this case, this workaround might tank the U.S. economy.” Supposedly, OpenAI’s models, their LLMs, cost a hundred million to train, and DeepSeek is claiming this thing — and they’ve been public, it’s open-source — costs a little over $5 million to train. So whereas the majority of LLM’s AI companies have been taking this brute-force strategy where it’s buy as many chips as possible, this is saying maybe you don’t need as many chips. The thing I find equally interesting is the second-order effects here. Constellation Energy and some of these nuclear stocks have skyrocketed because the choke point was supposedly going to be energy. But now with this model, which appears to have chips speaking to each other in a more efficient, less energy-consumptive way, nuclear stocks are crashing. Electric, Constellation Energy, all these companies that have had incredible run-ups are saying, “The assumptions we made about the supply chain in terms of the brute force of chips that we’re going to need, the amount of energy — it’s all now coming into a little bit of question.” But to be clear, the correction here is that it’s taken them back three months. And all of the stocks that have crashed, quote-unquote “crashed,” are only up 70 percent for the year now, not 98 percent. I think you have to put it in context. The smart analysts I’ve read have said that like every community or any sector, this is going to bifurcate into the cheap layer and the high-end layer, which will still go hard at massive computing and massive energy and do more sophisticated things. Everything eventually goes Walmart/Tiffany’s. And they’re saying this might be the Walmart. But it’s fascinating to see that the conventional wisdom that you would need massive GPUs and massive energy may not be written in law that we thought it was going to be. Swisher: Let me read from Yann LeCun, who’s the head of Meta. I just recently interviewed him, and you can go listen to that long interview about this. But he wrote, “To the people who see the performance of DeepSeek and think China’s surpassing the U.S. in AI, you’re reading this wrong. The correct reading is open-source models are surpassing proprietary ones. DeepSeek has profited from open research and open-source. For example, PyTorch and Llama from Meta. They came up with new ideas and built on top of other people’s work. Because their work is published and open-source, everyone can profit from it. This is the power of open research and open-source.” Galloway: He’s talking his own book. Swisher: That’s correct. I was just going to make that point. Galloway: Llama is open-source. Swisher: Yes, that’s correct. That’s what I was going to say. But it’s interesting. He’s having really interesting arguments. Gary Marcus, this guy who’s somewhat of a crank, was saying that “Congress needs to bring in Zuckerberg and LeCun to discuss how their unilateral open-sourcing decision rapidly undermined the U.S. advantage in generative AI.” LeCun goes, “An absolutely hilarious take revealing the complete misunderstanding of the fact that open research/open-source accelerates progress for everyone from someone who’s repeatedly claimed that deep learning was hitting a wall.” But one of the things he just wrote, again because he’s getting in there very deeply, “Major misunderstanding about AI infrastructure investments: Much of those billions are going into infrastructure for inference, not training. Running AI assistance services for billions of people requires a lot of compute. Once you put video understanding, reasoning, large-scale memory, and other capabilities into AI systems, inference costs are going to increase. The only real question is whether users will be willing to pay enough (directly or not) to justify CapEx and OpEx.” He thinks these reactions are woefully unjustified and, at the same time, he’s sort of arguing that they aren’t, right? Which is interesting. Galloway: It’s just so typical of the Chinese — the entire Chinese economy was sorta built on more for less. My guess is they had a mandate or they’ve said, “All right, we’re not going to have access to the same level of high-end chips. We need work-arounds.” And it appears to respond to really interesting innovation. Swisher: Using open-source? Galloway: Yeah, using open-source. I mean, the scary thing — in typical Meta fashion, you can download a version of Llama with absolutely no guardrails and you can request information on anything. The most politically correct I find of them is Anthropic. If I start asking questions about insider trading from Speaker Emerita Pelosi, it immediately gives me all these things back. “We cannot endorse nor promote strategies around insider trading.” ChatGPT goes straight into it, and I think Llama will say, “Well, here’s what you do. You call your cousin.” Swisher: You’re right. These open-source models have been a boon for China for sure, in keeping up. Galloway: It’ll be interesting to see what happens to the stock. These companies have already let some air out. The question is, and I don’t know the answer, is this the beginning of a massive correction that will infect the entire NASDAQ, the entire S&P? And quite frankly, now, these companies, I don’t want to say become too big to fail, but if they sneeze, the U.S. economy’s going to catch a cold. Swisher: That’s correct.

Title: Anti-Diversity Bigots May Have To Stop Wearing Makeup Altogether
URL: https://www.wonkette.com/p/anti-diversity-bigots-may-have-to
Time Published: 2025-01-28T17:15:44Z

Over the last week or so, several companies and brands have announced their plans to reject diversity and embrace sexism and white supremacy — assuming that, because Donald Trump won the election, that’s the nation’s current vibe. So far, these companies include Meta, Walmart, Amazon, Ford, Lowe’s, Harley Davidson, Brown-Forman (parent company of Jack Daniels), John Deere, Tractor Supply, and, perhaps most egregiously, Target — which has vowed not only to stop considering diversity in the workplace, but also to stop its efforts to carry Black-owned brands. Unlike some of these other companies, Target has long enjoyed a rather liberal customer base, especially as opposed to Walmart, their prime competitor. But hey! I guess they don’t need us and won’t mind when we don’t shop at their stores anymore, especially all those mini-Targets they spent so much money opening up in affluent urban areas over the last few years! Bucking this “trend,” several brands have stepped up to announce that they will be doing no such thing. This includes Costco, Apple, Pinterest, Bank of America, Delta Airlines, JP Morgan, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs — not to mention the many, many companies who so far have said nothing at this current moment, still have their DEI commitments prominently listed on their websites, and have spoken up for diversity in the past. The latest company to come forward and say they have no plans to start embracing white supremacy any time soon is, e.l.f. cosmetics — which is not surprising given their history, but is still a huge relief to me, personally. Loving this post? Not a free or paid subscriber yet? Let’s fix that! If you are not familiar, e.l.f. is a brand of very affordable (but also very high quality) makeup and skincare, usually available in drug stores (or in Target, though I won’t be buying it there anymore). It’s become incredibly popular, especially among those who do online makeup tutorials and reviews, over the last few years and has led to something of a drug store makeup renaissance. Via CNN: “There’s nothing wrong with being Richard, Rick or Dick, but we wanted to shine a light on ‘let’s give other people a chance’ because we’ve seen the benefits in our own business,” e.l.f. CEO Tarang Amin said in an interview last week with CNN. E.l.f is one of only two publicly traded companies with a board that’s more than 78% women and 44% people of color. […] Amin was referring to the company’s popular “So Many Dicks,” campaign, which highlighted the fact that there are more men named Richard, Rick, Rich, or Dick on the boards of companies than there are members of some entire marginalized groups of people. That’s a good campaign! E.l.f. has reaped the benefits of its strategy. The company has posted 23 consecutive quarters of sales growth, and its stock has increased by more than 700% over the past five years. E.l.f. doesn’t have a DEI team, but its commitment to hiring a diverse workforce across gender, race, sexual orientation, nationality and other demographic lines has driven its success, Amin said. Around 75% of its roughly 500 employees are women and 40% are people of color. As part of e.l.f.’s diversity and inclusion strategy, the company also features transgender and non-binary models in advertising. “Diverse voices actually help us because they’re bringing different perspectives,” Amin, 59, said. Companies that abandon their diversity efforts risk losing out on “incredible talent that has different points of view and that add perspective to a company.” So weird how that works! Personally, I’m a huge fan of e.l.f. products to begin with — not only are they extremely affordable, many of their products are as good or better than some of the more expensive brands. Their eyeshadows are highly pigmented and blendable, their brushes are my favorite, their Halo Glow is comparable to Charlotte Tilbury’s Flawless Filter, and their Power Grip primer is better than anything else on the market. They even have some things those brands don’t have, like a bright blue color corrector that has made finding a foundation or concealer I can wear without looking fluorescent orange a far less exhausting venture. It is, quite literally, not easy being green. Well, light olive, anyway. (Don’t worry — we’re not suddenly doing sponcon now, I just really like their makeup.) This is far from the first time the company has publicly touted the benefits of DEI. Last year, e.l.f. partnered with North Carolina A&T State University on a study that drew on five years’ worth of data to show that S&P 500 companies with diverse boards are more successful than those without. The study found that companies with diverse boards had: • 15% higher ROI [return on investment] than S&P 500 companies• 50% reduction in earnings risk measured by EPS over 1 year of S&P 500 companies • Women on boards correlate to better price-to-earnings ratios • Boards with 3+ women and/or minorities have fewer lawsuits Of course, as the authors of the study note, theirs isn’t the only one that has shown that companies that embrace diversity are more successful than those that do not. You know, I was wondering why so many of the companies that were not being gross about diversity were banks, and I’ll bet you that last entry, the study that found that “board gender heterogeneity positively impacted performance of banks” just may have had something to do with it. (Okay, it has more to do with the fact that it was brought up at Davos, but still!) E.l.f. is definitely doing well in this regard, but the fact is, over the last few years, beauty brands have found that diversity isn’t just the morally correct thing to do, it’s also very much where the money is. Rihanna’s Fenty led the way by bringing an incredibly wide range of shades to their foundation and concealer lines, and other lines, realizing that there was money to be made in acknowledging the fact that Black people exist and in many shades. Additionally, for brands that have failed on this front, the backlash has been swift and terrible. Now, people are very much paying attention to whether or not a brand has a wide spectrum of shades, whether their blushes can be worn by people of all colors, etc., and not doing this can definitely cause a brand to get the kind of “ick” factor that results in influencers not wanting anything to do with them. Donate Just Once! For an industry that has not, in the past, done too great with inclusivity — and which has had an absolute fuckton of controversy in that regard — beauty brands have so far not participated in the so-called “DEI backlash,” perhaps only because they are heavily aware that coming out against diversity and in favor of white supremacy is just not a thing that will go over too well with their prime customer base. In fact, I would bet that even some of the worst-offending brands won’t even try it. But that’s the benefit, really, of holding brands accountable. Vote with your feet, vote with your dollar, support companies that do well and be sure to let those that don’t know that there will be consequences. PREVIOUSLY ON WONKETTE!

Title: How DeepSeek flipped the tech world on its head overnight
URL: https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/deepseek-news-roundup/
Time Published: 2025-01-28T17:11:16Z
Full Content:
DeepSeek, the chatbot made by a Chinese startup that seemingly dethroned ChatGPT, is taking the world by storm. It’s currently the number one topic all over the news, and a lot has happened in the past 24 hours. Among other highlights, Nvidia’s stock plummeted as a response to DeepSeek; President Donald Trump commented on the new AI; Mark Zuckerberg is assembling a team to find an answer to DeepSeek. Below, we’ll cover all the latest news you need to know about DeepSeek. Although ChatGPT is the chatbot that quickly lost its public favorite status with the rise of DeepSeek, Nvidia is the company that suffered the greatest losses. In fact, Nvidia’s market loss following the launch of DeepSeek’s large language model (LLM) marks the greatest one-day stock market drop in history, says Forbes. Nvidia lost nearly $600 billion as a result of the Chinese company behind DeepSeek revealing just how cheap the new LLM is to develop in comparison to rivals from Anthropic, Meta, or OpenAI. Nvidia now holds the top spots for the two biggest one-day stock market losses in history, but the other two were nowhere near as bad as this. Yesterday, Nvidia’s shares nosedived by 17%, adding up to a $589 billion loss in market capitalization. Previous loss took place in September 2024 and was valued at $279 billion. Markets are emotional, and they responded to DeepSeek’s claims that it only spent $5.6 million on Nvidia’s high-performance computing (HPC) graphics cards in order to develop DeepSeek. Experts claim that figure is vastly lower than the reality, but it’s also a lot lower than anything anyone has ever thought possible, calling into question the need for so many of Nvidia’s GPUs to be sold and used on a daily basis for the purpose of training AI. Nvidia’s stocks are beginning to bounce back, recovering from just over $116 on Tuesday morning to just under $121 per share at the time of writing. On Friday, the stock price was at $142 per share. President Donald Trump made a statement about DeepSeek, calling it “a wake-up call” for the U.S. tech industry. He referred to DeepSeek’s claim that its new R1 AI model can do all of the same things as its rivals, but it’ll cost a mere fraction of what OpenAI, Meta, and others have spent on their alternatives. As seen on BBC, President Trump said: “The release of DeepSeek, an AI from a Chinese company, should be a wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win. […] We always have the ideas, we’re always first. I would say that it could be very much a positive development. Instead of spending billions and billions, you’ll spend less, and you’ll come up with, hopefully, the same solution.” As mentioned above, OpenAI is far from the only company affected by the sudden interest in DeepSeek. In fact, as reported by Fortune, the new LLM has Mark Zuckerberg scrambling for urgent solutions. The publication reports that Meta has “assembled four war rooms of engineers” with the sole purpose of figuring out how DeepSeek achieved what it claims to have achieved, as well as spearheading innovation on Meta’s end. Fortune reveals that two of the four teams of engineers will focus on finding out how DeepSeek was able to build such a capable LLM at such a low cost. One team’s purpose will be to find out which data sets DeepSeek was trained on. Meanwhile, the final team’s goal will be to work on restructuring Meta’s Llama models and searching for improvements. Elon Musk took to X (formerly Twitter) to express his doubt as to whether DeepSeek can truly do what it claims to be capable of at such a low cost. He responded to various posts, such as one from Mark Benioff, Salesforce CEO, who announced that DeepSeek was now the number one app on the Apple AppStore. Musk’s many responses were generally poking fun at the AI and its impact on the industry. 😂 &mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 27, 2025 Lmao no &mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 27, 2025 Meanwhile, OpenAI’s Sam Altman adopted a different approach. In a short series of posts on X, the CEO behind the company that runs ChatGPT praised DeepSeek while also making it clear that OpenAI isn’t going anywhere. deepseek&#39;s r1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they&#39;re able to deliver for the price. we will obviously deliver much better models and also it&#39;s legit invigorating to have a new competitor! we will pull up some releases. &mdash; Sam Altman (@sama) January 28, 2025 “We will obviously deliver much better models and it’s also legit invigorating to have a new competitor! We will pull up some releases,” said Altman. “Look forward to bringing you all AGI and beyond.” Going viral has some downsides, as DeepSeek has quickly found out. As reported by CNBC and DeepSeek’s own signup site, the chatbot is being hit with large-scale cyberattacks. As a result, new users may have a hard time registering, as DeepSeek is limiting sign-ups while it deals with these issues. While new users may be unable to join at the moment, if you’re already signed up, you should be able to use DeepSeek without issues. While the world is hyped with the buzz around DeepSeek, experts are less eager to embrace the new chatbot. As reported by The Guardian, there are data privacy concerns to keep in mind when interacting with the new budget-friendly AI model. A professor from Oxford University warned that the data you share with the chatbot could end up in the hands of the Chinese government, saying: “I think it’s fine to download it and ask it about the performance of Liverpool football club or chat about the history of the Roman empire, but would I recommend putting anything sensitive or personal or private on them? Absolutely not — because you don’t know where the data goes.” We've officially passed the second anniversary of the start of the AI boom, and things haven't slowed down. Just the opposite. Generative AI is ramping up at a pace that feels nearly overwhelming, expanding into new platforms, mediums, and even devices at a relentless pace. Here are the 10 announcements that made 2024 a monumental year in the world of AI. OpenAI releases GPT-4o OpenAI kicked off its inaugural "12 Days of OpenAI" media blitz on December 5, each day unveiling new features, models, subscription tiers, and capabilities for its growing ChatGPT product ecosystem during a series of live-stream events. Here's a quick rundown of everything the company announced.

Plus: DeepSeek’s Debut Chills Markets, Trump Remakes IRS And Tax Policy In His Image, DEI Wins And Loses, Boeing’s Bad 2024 Continues A Trend Of Losses Monday was one of the worst days the Nasdaq has seen in two years, thanks to a massive tech selloff. Chinese AI model DeepSeek, an apparently self-funded platform that reportedly cost just $5.6 million to train, and which was likely developed with less powerful chips than those behind U.S.-based models from companies including OpenAI, made many U.S. tech investors pause and pull back. DeepSeek, which outperformed some OpenAI models, showed the U.S. that a Chinese tech company could become a frontrunner in the race to develop generative AI platforms, despite extensive restrictions placed on U.S. tech exports by former president Joe Biden to prevent that. Investor and billionaire Marc Andreessen wrote on X that DeepSeek’s model is “AI’s Sputnik moment,” Forbes’ Rashi Shrivastava and Richard Nieva wrote. DeepSeek pulled the tech-heavy Nasdaq down more than 3% on Monday, but individual companies saw much deeper losses. Nvidia, which makes the processors that power the U.S.’s AI revolution, saw its stock fall nearly 17% on Monday, setting records by shedding nearly $589 billion in the company’s market value. In a statement, Nvidia called DeepSeek’s model an “excellent AI advancement” that actually does use “significant numbers” of Nvidia’s GPUs, but they’re less powerful ones made for use in China that are “fully export control compliant.” Nvidia wasn’t the only company to see a big loss on Monday driven by DeepSeek. Chipmakers Broadcom saw a 17% one-day drop, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, whose stock fell 13%, were also hurt by the news. The markets slowly began recovering Tuesday, but increases were more gradual. There’s long been speculation that AI companies were becoming overvalued. Nvidia rocketed from a company that made graphics cards for video games to the leading player in AI hardware—and now with eyes on self-driving cars, robotics and smart warehouses—in a matter of years, and has at times been the world’s most valuable company. While Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, Meta and Apple have several other services, company progress on AI has played an outsized role as in how their shares have performed. And private companies including OpenAI—valued at $157 billion—and Anthropic—worth $6 billion after a pending $2 billion funding round is finalized—are pulling in dollars and influence. According to Crunchbase, close to a third of all global venture funding in 2024 went to companies in AI-related fields, totaling more than $100 billion. Is this the beginning of the burst of the AI bubble? It could be. Before DeepSeek impacted U.S. markets, Forbes contributor Abdo Riani compared AI to the tech bubble a generation ago, when early dot-com companies quickly went from ballooning fortunes to struggling to keep the lights on. The dot-com bubble was fueled by investor over-optimism in the power of the internet, overlooking rational considerations of what the technology could do and deliver. The companies that survived the bubble’s burst, including Amazon, Google and eBay, Riani wrote, used the technology to bring specific values and usage to the technology. The stock market leader of two years from now may be a company that can use AI to make a difference through AI-powered agents, or mostly autonomous robots and vehicles. But maybe it will still be Nvidia, which will continue creating the hardware for AI, and has a good track record of recovering from drastic swings in its value. The CFO’s role in a company is always evolving. I talked to Megan Weis, vice president and general manager of finance & accounting outsourcing services at finance talent company Personiv, and host of a weekly CFO podcast, about the changes she’s seeing in the job. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. President Donald Trump speaks at a White House news conference last week. Taxes are important to Donald Trump, and he’s pressing forward with remaking the IRS in his policy likeness. Former IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel officially left the department on January 20, writes Forbes’ Kelly Phillips Erb, clearing a path for Trump nominee Billy Long to take over. IRS commissioners serve five-year terms and are generally not replaced as administrations change. Werfel’s term wasn’t up until late 2027. No confirmation hearings appear to be scheduled for Long, a former congressman and Trump loyalist with no direct background in tax policy. Among his day one executive orders, Trump put a 90-day federal hiring freeze in place throughout the government so the new Department of Government Efficiency could figure out the correct size of the government workforce. However, the IRS hiring freeze seems more permanent, and will remain in place until the Treasury secretary determines it’s in the national interest to lift it, Phillips Erb writes. Biden boosted the IRS’s personnel funding in order to provide better and faster service to taxpayers, as well as to pursue high-wealth individuals, large corporations and complex partnerships to ensure they are paying their fair share. In November and December 2023, the IRS offered positions to more than 560 new accountants. This week, Phillips Erb writes, job offers have been rescinded to job candidates with start dates after February 8. Trump has also talked about firing existing IRS employees, aiming at the 87,000 new IRS workers—for positions ranging from customer service and IT to enforcement—that would be hired over the next decade through 2023’s Inflation Reduction Act. “They hired, or tried to hire, 88,000 workers to go after you and we're in the process of developing a plan to either terminate all of them, or maybe we'll move them to the border,” he told a crowd last week at the Circa Resort & Casino in Las Vegas, Phillips Erb reported. While Trump passed large tax cuts in his first term and has said extending—or even increasing—them is a priority in his second, Republicans in Congress are hashing out the best way to do that. Trump has said he wants everything in one bill so it’s easier to get everything that is wanted. The Senate confirmed Scott Bessent as Treasury secretary on Monday, so the leadership to enact those cuts is now in place. As far as international taxes, Trump also issued a memo saying that any commitment made under the Biden administration to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development with respect to the Global Tax Deal will not be followed. The OECD determines how international corporations are taxed by all countries, and Trump’s memo says that Congress will work toward a more America first tax policy, Phillips Erb writes. A Costco store in Richmond, California. As some companies rein in their diversity, equity and inclusion efforts—last week, Target joined the list of companies scaling back policies to increase hiring and promotions of people of color and women—others are doubling down on them. Costco’s shareholders almost unanimously bucked a challenge to its diversity policies, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. The National Center for Public Policy Research had petitioned the retailer to audit the company’s “litigation, reputational and financial risks” caused by its DEI policies. Costco’s leadership rejected the proposal last month and urged shareholders to vote it down, saying that the retailer regularly evaluates its policies. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon also stood firm in his commitment to DEI initiatives, saying, “Bring them on” in an interview with CNBC last week, Forbes senior contributor Jack Kelly writes. However, business DEI policies may be thrust in an uncomfortable spotlight by Trump, who opposes the policy. He signed a day one executive order ending federal DEI programs, saying that the “illegal and immoral” plans “demonstrated immense public waste and shameful discrimination.” Another executive order brings this crackdown to the private sector by rescinding a 1965 anti-discrimination order for federal contractors from President Lyndon B. Johnson. Trump is now requiring agencies to identify contractors who use “coded or imprecise language” to “obscure” DEI initiatives, as well as identifying up to nine potential civil compliance investigations of private sector entities “to deter DEI programs or principles…that constitute illegal discrimination or preferences.” The attorney general will take this information and issue a report of recommendations to take action within 120 days. The fuselage and one of the engines of a Boeing 777-9 jetliner aircraft on the tarmac at Dubai World Central - Al-Maktoum International Airport. With a shocking in-flight plane malfunction, a rejected plea deal for two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019, and a seven-week machinists strike halting production, Boeing had a terrible 2024—posting a stunning $11.8 billion loss. But, Forbes’ Jeremy Bogaisky writes, that’s actually part of a pattern for Boeing. The aircraft company is on a six-year losing streak, and is likely to have lost a total of $35.7 billion in that time period. Forbes senior contributor Jim Osman writes that activist investors—including investment titan Warren Buffett—may be looking closely at Boeing as a potential target. Personiv Vice President and General Manager of Finance & Accounting Outsourcing Services Megan Weis. As vice president and general manager of finance & accounting outsourcing services at finance talent company Personiv, Megan Weis has her finger on the pulse of how the CFO’s profession is changing. She also talks with different CFOs about their work in her CFO Weekly podcast. I talked to her about the CFO’s evolution in 2025. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. How do you see the CFO’s role continuing to evolve in 2025? Weis: I can’t have a conversation these days without hearing about generative AI. It’s still pretty nascent. Most smaller to mid-size companies are experimenting with some things here and there at the moment, whereas enterprise companies are using it to turn data into actionable insights. Technology is going to continue to evolve. Cybersecurity is becoming a huge issue these days, and CFOs are becoming more and more responsible for managing that risk. Hackers are becoming more clever, and the risks are just becoming more and more. Globally, it’s becoming very unstable. We have supply chain issues, there are currency fluctuations, inflationary concerns. It’s becoming more complex. Soft skills are becoming and more and more of a requirement. The CFO role is like a ringleader; it’s very collaborative. The CFO is becoming more responsible for communicating across the organization, and that ties back to the idea of being the storyteller. With so much data out there, it’s becoming increasingly necessary to digest that data, turn it into actionable insights, and be able to communicate it back to the organization in a way that finance or non-finance and accounting people can understand, whether that be employees or investors. How did the evolution to CFO-as-storyteller begin, and what stories can the CFO tell that a company would miss otherwise? It started when the CFO role started gearing toward being more of a strategic role, or a right hand to the CEO. The CFO is becoming more responsible for bridging the gap between finance and other departments. They’re responsible for collaborating. A lot of them throughout their career are stepping out of finance for a time and concentrating more in operational areas. [It’s important] being able to communicate to investors [and] employees, and really humanizing financial data. At this point, there’s just so much data that's available to finance and accounting and the CFO that you really have to take that data, boil it down, digest it, tell a story with it, and then align that story with the culture and the objectives of the organization. In general, the world is looking for more transparency. They’re looking for organizations who stand for something, and that’s part of where the storytelling comes in. People want to work for organizations that are purpose-driven and where the stories align, whether that be the stories they’re trying to sell to investors or the story that their financial data is telling. Transparency is becoming more and more critical. Historically, CFOs have been more of a news reporter. They’ve taken historical data and regurgitated it back to investors and companies, whereas today, they’re more forward-looking, more strategic. They still have to get the numbers, but they’re helping to shape the story more than just report the news. How do fractional CFOs work, and how often are they being used? Fractional CFOs are something that I hadn’t really heard about before I’d started this podcast. I do think that they are becoming more prevalent. They’ve grown over the last decade or so, and they’re being used a lot for small and mid-size businesses who can’t afford a full-time CFO, but still need the guidance of someone with experience being a CFO. The fractional CFO plays really well into the gig economy: People wanting a portfolio of work, and maybe not just relying on one employee to be their employee for their entire career. That’s not the way things work anymore. An employe[r] might not hold on to you for your entire career. Building a portfolio of clients for CFOs is the route that they want to go. Also, with more PE-backed companies, those PE firms are looking for CFOs, and someone with the experience of a CFO to help make strategic decisions for those organizations, help guide them through growth periods. I also think fractional CFOs play a big part in a company being able to be agile and pull in experts when those experts are needed. Every company goes through different stages, whether that be growth or crisis, and I think the fractional CFO allows those small companies to be agile and pull in the right talent when it’s needed. Unionized employees at Costco voted to go on strike when their contract expires on January 31. The company has rejected union proposals for increased seniority pay, paid family leave, bereavement policies, sick time and safeguards against surveillance. 18,000: Number of Costco employees represented by the Teamsters union—about 8% of the warehouse retailer’s full workforce 26%: Costco’s profit growth since the current union contract, signed in 2022 ‘Costco claims to treat workers better than the competition, but right now, it’s failing to live up to that reputation’: Tom Erickson, director of the Teamsters Warehouse Division, said in a statement To be a leader that employees, colleagues and investors trust, it’s important to be authentic.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Microsoft (MSFT) reported its second quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, beating estimates on the top and bottom lines but falling short on estimates for its Intelligent Cloud business. Microsoft stock fell 6% after the market opened Thursday on the news. Microsoft’s Commercial Cloud segment revenue, which includes cloud services sales, saw revenue of $40 billion, a 21% year-over-year increase but shy of Wall Street expectations of $41.1 billion. Microsoft's intelligent cloud business, which includes its Azure platform, saw revenue of $25.5 billion. Wall Street was expecting $25.8 billion. The company said it saw 13 percentage points of growth in Azure from AI services. Cloud gross margin, however, decreased to 70% on the company's artificial intelligence build-out. “We are innovating across our tech stack and helping customers unlock the full ROI of AI to capture the massive opportunity ahead," Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. “Already, our AI business has surpassed an annual revenue run rate of $13 billion, up 175% year-over-year.” During the company's earnings call, Microsoft said its Intelligent Cloud revenue for the current quarter would land between $25.9 billion and $26.2 billion, sending shares lower. The earnings announcement comes as Wall Street continues to digest the fallout surrounding DeepSeek’s impact on the AI industry and Silicon Valley’s tech titans. Microsoft and its Big Tech cohort are investing tens of billions of dollars in AI data centers, with Microsoft saying it plans to spend $80 billion in fiscal 2025 alone. But China's DeepSeek sent a jolt through the tech sector, saying it trained its AI model on systems that use less power than leading AI chips and at a fraction of the price of those produced by American rivals like Microsoft-backed OpenAI, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META). That has investors questioning whether Silicon Valley is making the right investments. For the quarter, Microsoft reported earnings per share (EPS) of $3.23 on revenue of $69.6 billion. Analysts were anticipating EPS of $3.13 on revenue of $68.8 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data. The company reported EPS of $2.93 on revenue of $62 billion in the same quarter last year. While Microsoft is one of the main beneficiaries of the AI boom, its stock price has lagged behind the competition. Shares of Microsoft were up just 5% over the last 12 months as of Monday, while Amazon (AMZN) and Google shares were up 44% and 26%, respectively. Microsoft is also seeking to jump-start PC sales via its Copilot+ PC lineup. The idea is that AI PCs will be able to run AI applications natively rather than via the cloud. But so far, there aren’t very many intriguing scenarios in which those applications make upgrading worthwhile. Hardware updates like improved performance and power are still the main reason consumers want new PCs. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com. Follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Microsoft (MSFT) will report its second quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday as Wall Street continues to digest the fallout surrounding DeepSeek’s impact on the AI industry and Silicon Valley’s tech titans. Microsoft and its Big Tech cohort are investing tens of billions of dollars in the data centers and infrastructure needed to train and deploy AI software across their various services. But China’s DeepSeek upended the general thinking that developing AI models requires the use of the most powerful, and expensive, chips with the release of its R1 model on Jan. 20. The model, the company claims, was trained on systems that were less powerful and less expensive than those produced by American rivals like Microsoft-backed OpenAI, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META). The company’s app shot to the top of the App Store over the weekend, driving a huge amount of interest in the relatively small firm and clobbering American AI stocks, including AI bellwether Nvidia. Now Microsoft will have to prove not only that its own AI work is paying off in terms of increased revenue but also that its hefty infrastructure investments are truly necessary. For the quarter, Microsoft is expected to report earnings per share (EPS) of $3.13 on revenue of $68.8 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data. The company reported EPS of $2.93 on revenue of $62 billion in the same quarter last year. Importantly, Microsoft’s Commercial Cloud segment revenue, which includes cloud services sales, is expected to come in at $41.1 billion. That would be an increase from the $31.9 billion the company reported in Q2 last year. Its intelligent cloud business, which includes its Azure platform, is set to come in at $25.8 billion, up from $21.5 billion. In a note to investors, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said he believes Azure growth will begin to reaccelerate in the second half of 2025. “Our checks continue to indicate improving consumption/core cloud trends,” he wrote. “Also, [Microsoft] just announced that ‘OpenAI recently made a new, large Azure commitment that will continue to support all OpenAI products as well as training.’ ” While Microsoft is one of the main beneficiaries of the AI boom, its stock price has lagged behind the competition. Shares of Microsoft were up just 5% over the last 12 months as of Monday, while Amazon (AMZN) and Google shares were up 44% and 26%, respectively. Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne, however, says the stock could be set up for a “mini revenge trade” as AI sales increase, its Copilot adoption rate improves, and capital expenditure moderates, creating more free cash flow. Microsoft is also seeking to jump-start PC sales via its Copilot+ PC lineup. The idea is that AI PCs will be able to run AI applications natively rather than via the cloud.

Title: Why Everyone Is Freaking Out About DeepSeek, China’s Answer to ChatGPT

Time Published: 2025-01-28T16:27:57Z

By Miles Klee Years of feverish hype around artificial intelligence technology have convinced many that it’s Silicon Valley‘s next speculative bubble — and prompted questions of how long giants like OpenAI can keep burning through billions of dollars in their quest for a true breakthrough AI. Now, a Chinese company has unveiled a cutting-edge AI model that it says it developed in under two months, with end-stage training costs of less than $6 million, figures that significantly undercut the levels of investment from U.S. firms in bots such as ChatGPT and the infrastructure to run them. And the market may never be the same. DeepSeek — the name of both the lab and its model — emerged as a side project of Liang Wenfeng, co-founder of the hedge fund High-Flyer, who began importing processing chips from Nvidia in 2021 for the project. (The California-based manufacturer is a major supplier of the high-performance graphic processing units, or GPUs, hardware that provides the tremendous computing power necessary to train and run AI.) In 2023, High-Flyer launched a version of DeepSeek as an internal tool to help identify and predict market trends to improve its trading decisions. But last week, the company released an “AI assistant” bot, DeepSeek-V3, a large language model that has since become the most-downloaded free app on Apple devices (ahead of OpenAI’s ChatGPT), and a reasoning model, DeepSeek-R1, that it claims hits the same benchmarks as OpenAI’s comparable model. The lab has also debuted a multimodal model capable of generating images that appears to outperform competitors DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion. These various upstarts alone might have sent ripples through venture capital firms and major tech players that have bet billions on AI, including Microsoft, Meta, Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, and Nvidia. What really shook these investors on Monday, however, was the efficiency touted by DeepSeek: it reportedly uses a limited number of reduced-capacity chips from Nvidia, in turn substantially lowering operating costs and the price of premium models for consumers. By contrast, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged just weeks ago that the company loses money even on pro subscriptions that cost $200 a month, thanks to the astronomical cost of the processing power their software requires. With an alleged price tag of around $5.5 million for its final phase of development, DeepSeek-V3 also represents a relatively cheap alternative to models that have cost tens of millions to engineer. On top of all that, DeepSeek’s codes are actually open-source, freely available for users to distribute and modify, or run on a private device without giving away personal data. U.S. firms, meanwhile, tend to keep the inner workings of their AIs cloaked in as much secrecy as possible. Editor’s picks The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time The upshot of all this was a sudden loss of faith in industry leaders, including several who are collaborating on a $500 billion project to expand AI infrastructure under President Trump, known as the Stargate Initiative. The chipmaker Nvidia was hardest hit, losing $600 billion in market capitalization as its share price plummeted 17 percent — the largest single-day drop for a U.S. corporation in history. This sell-off indicated a sense that the next wave of AI models may not require the tens of thousands of top-end GPUs that Silicon Valley behemoths have amassed into computing superclusters for the purposes of accelerating their AI innovation. Sharply reduced demand for chips and massive data centers like those Trump has proposed under Stargate (in an announcement that propelled AI stocks higher just days ago) could entirely reshape this sector of the economy. By Monday’s market close, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 stock market index had shed an incredible $1 trillion from its value on Friday. Of course, DeepSeek’s big splash also made it a target, and the company limited registration on Monday during what it called “large-scale malicious attacks” on its services (though without limiting access to existing users). At the same time, certain analysts argued that the market panic about the long-term competitiveness of the U.S. in the AI race could be an overreaction. After all, DeepSeek may point the way for increased efficiency in American-made models, some investors will buy in during this dip, and, as a Chinese company, DeepSeek faces some of the same national security concerns that have bedeviled ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok.

To some observers, it will start to appear that such spending is not only unsustainable but ultimately wasteful, considering how much a foreign startup has accomplished with far less. We haven’t seen the bubble burst just yet, but with this many investors rushing to unload assets that suddenly seem a lot riskier, you can practically hear it deflating. We want to hear it.

Title: China's DeepSeek chatbot reportedly gets much more done with fewer GPUs but Nvidia still thinks it's 'excellent' news

Nvidia claims more AI from fewer chips is good for business. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. China's new DeepSeek R1 language model has been shaking things up by reportedly matching or even beating the performance of established rivals including OpenAI while using far fewer GPUs. Nvidia's response? R1 is "excellent" news that proves the need for even more of its AI-accelerating chips. If you're thinking the math doesn't immediately add up, the stock market agrees, what with $600 billion being wiped off Nvidia's share price this week. So, let's consider a few facts for a moment. Reuters reports that DeepSeek's development entailed 2,000 of Nvidia's H800 GPUs and a training budget of just $6 million, while CNBC claims that R1 "outperforms" the best LLMs from the likes of OpenAI and others. The H800 is a special variant of Nvidia's Hopper H100 GPU that's been hobbled to fit within the US's export restriction rules for AI chips. Some in the AI industry claim that China generally and DeepSeek, in particular, have managed to dodge the export rules and acquire large numbers of Nvidia's more powerful H100 GPUs, but Nvidia has denied that claim. Meanwhile, it's thought OpenAI used 25,000 of Nvidia's previous-gen A100 chips to train ChatGPT 4. It's hard to compare the A100 to the H800 directly, but it certainly seems like DeepSeek got more done with fewer GPUs. That's why the market got the yips when it comes to Nvidia. Maybe we don't need quite as many chips for the AI revolution as was once thought? Needless to say, Nvidia doesn't see it that way, lauding R1 for demonstrating how the so-called "Test Time" scaling technique can help create more powerful AI models. “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling,” the company told CNBC. "DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant." Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Of course, all may not be quite as it seems. As Andy reported yesterday, some observers think DeepSeek is actually spending more like $500 million to $1 billion a year. But the general consensus is that DeepSeek is getting more done for much less investment than the established players. Microsoft, for instance, expects to spend $80 billion on AI hardware this year, with Meta saying it will unload $60 to $65 billion. DeepSeek's R1 model seems to imply that similar results can be achieved for an order of magnitude less investment. Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD.Best gaming motherboard: The right boards.Best graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits.Best SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the rest. The question is, does that automatically mean fewer GPUs being bought? Perhaps not. At the kind of investment levels demonstrated by the likes of Microsoft and Meta, the number of organisations that can get involved is necessarily limited. It's just too expensive. Cut that by a tenth or more and suddenly the number of potential participants might explode. And they'll all want GPUs. It's a little like the move from mainframe to personal computing. Sure, each individual investment in computing was a lot smaller, but the computing business overall grew far larger. So, maybe DeepSeek is an inflection point. From here on, AI development is more accessible, less dominated by a small number of hugely wealthy entities, and maybe even a bit more democratic. Or maybe we'll find out that DeepSeek has used a mountain of H100s after all. Either way, Nvidia will be planning to make its own mountain—of cash. Jeremy has been writing about technology and PCs since the 90nm Netburst era (Google it!) and enjoys nothing more than a serious dissertation on the finer points of monitor input lag and overshoot followed by a forensic examination of advanced lithography. Or maybe he just likes machines that go “ping!” He also has a thing for tennis and cars. Waiting for the launch of Nvidia's RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 is getting in-tents with hopefuls already pitching up outside of Micro Center stores New Intel Battlemage graphics cards spotted but they may not be the cut-price RTX 4070 killers we're all desperate for Where to buy the Nvidia RTX 5080: reviewed today, released tomorrow—here's every RTX 5080 listing I've found so far Pcgamer is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is scrambling after a small Chinese startup called DeepSeek turned Silicon Valley upside down with its chatbot app. The company's latest R1 AI model can run circles around the competition from Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic — and at a tiny fraction of the cost. Despite some skepticism over DeepSeek's claims, the debut has led to some serious soul-searching among AI investors, with the ChatGPT competitor wiping out an estimated $1 trillion in value among other AI companies on Monday. In the most extreme example, AI chipmaker Nvidia set a new record for the biggest single-day loss of any company in history. Among others, the app appears to have caught Meta with its pants down. In response, the company assembled several"war rooms" of engineers, The Information reports, in a desperate attempt to get ahead of the situation. The war rooms are now hard at work, analyzing DeepSeek and looking for possible changes to make to Meta's flagship AI, Llama. And according to the report, engineers are already afraid that the next version of the AI won't be able to compete with the Chinese AI — early indications that this week's chaos might represent the new status quo, rather than a momentary blip as investors find their new footing. "The main frustration is, ‘Why didn’t we come up with this first?' when we have thousands of the brightest minds working on this," one Meta employee told the Financial Times. After trading resumed on Tuesday, Nvidia's share price ricocheted around a bit, but fell far short of recovery. Meanwhile, Meta's stock has largely been unaffected and is up just over seven percent over the last five days, with investors arguing that DeepSeek could bring positive changes to the platform's AI efforts. A notable quality that Llama and DeepSeek share is that they're both open-source, which means developers have unfettered access to the underlying code. But Llama has historically struggled to keep up with the offerings from the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic. Now that DeepSeek has thrown the gauntlet in front of the latter two, it'll be interesting to see if Meta can pull ahead. Over the weekend, Zuckerberg committed a whopping $60 billion to AI-related capital expenditures this year alone. In short, the company is all in, intensifying its efforts to keep up with the soaring competition. The war rooms are looking to combine several AI models into one more fully featured system, much like DeepSeek. But whether its efforts will pay off — lowering computing costs for Llama while simultaneously making it more useful — is anyone's guess. Remember when Zuckerberg was all in on the metaverse?

Manage your account For the second time in the last month, a Chinese app has skyrocketed to the top spot in Apple’s App Store. The first was Xiaohongshu, or RedNote, which saw a sudden surge in downloads by United States users seeking an alternative to TikTok in anticipation of the ban on that app, which had been scheduled to take effect on Jan. 19. Now it’s DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence company that released a new chatbot model called R1 on Jan. 20. The DeepSeek app has since climbed to the top of the Apple App charts, recording more than 1.6 million downloads since it launched on Jan. 10, according to the market tracker App Figures. DeepSeek announced Monday that it is temporarily restricting new users from signing up for its services, citing “large-scale malicious attacks.” But prior to that, the Chinese startup and its new chatbot seemed on track to surpass the popularity of U.S.-based AI companies such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Meta’s Llama and Google’s Gemini. But DeepSeek's success in the U.S. has raised some questions. David Sacks, Trump’s AI and crypto czar, said in a Fox News interview on Tuesday that there’s “substantial evidence” that DeepSeek “distilled” knowledge from OpenAI’s AI models. Sacks did not elaborate on what kind of evidence he was referring to, but multiple news outlets reported later that day that Microsoft, OpenAI's largest investor, was investigating whether DeepSeek obtained OpenAI data in an unauthorized way to build R1. According to OpenAI's Terms of Use, users are not allowed to use OpenAI to build a separate, competitive AI model. At a House Republican retreat in Miami on Monday, Trump called the initial success of DeepSeek’s R1 model “very much a positive development” because “instead of spending billions and billions, you’ll spend less, and you’ll come up with, hopefully, the same solution.” He then added it should also be seen as a “wake-up call” for U.S.-based tech companies to develop “a faster method of AI, and much less expensive method.” Here’s what to know. DeepSeek was founded in May 2023, by leaders at the Chinese hedge fund, High-Flyer. The company launched its first AI model chatbot, R1, on Jan. 20. In posts on X, fans of R1 have praised the chatbot’s responses as “human-like” and quick, praising the fact that the app is available for free and that users need not have coding experience to understand how to operate it. In addition to its sudden popularity on the App Store, DeepSeek has attracted attention for its relatively small staff and budget, as compared with the sums American companies have spent on AI development. According to a report in the Wall Street Journal over the weekend, DeepSeek launched R1 with a team of less than 200 people and only spent $5.6 million to train its AI models. By comparison, last week, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said his social media conglomerate would invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in AI development this year. In 2024, Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said the tech industry would need to spend “trillions” on the computer chips used to power AI. Altman called DeepSeek’s R1 “an impressive model” especially “for the price” in a post on X. “We will obviously deliver much better models and also it’s legit invigorating to have a new competitor!” he wrote. Like other Chinese platforms, there are signs of censorship on DeepSeek on certain topics that are considered sensitive in China, such as questions about the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests or China's President Xi Jinping. DeepSeek’s success appears to challenge the idea that the U.S. has control of the AI industry. Concerns about this potential threat to U.S. dominance in the field seemed to be reflected on Wall Street Monday, with stocks falling for massive tech giants like Nvidia, Meta and Google’s parent company, Alphabet. In particular, the company’s claim that it built its AI model at a much lower cost compared to other, similar AI platforms seems to be causing panic in the stock market. Yahoo Finance reported that Nvidia, one of the most valuable tech companies in the world, and which builds computer chips for AI, lost a record $589 billion in market capitalization yesterday. The net worth of Nvidia’s CEO and biggest shareholder, Jensen Huang, fell $20.8 billion. Read more about the stock market reaction from Yahoo Finance: AI-exposed power stocks get crushed as fears about DeepSeek trigger stock market sell-off In the past, Washington has banned exporting higher-end technologies to China in hopes of stalling China’s advances in AI. A week before leaving office, Biden’s administration proposed a new framework for restricting U.S. exports of AI computer chips, to prevent countries like China from accessing the advanced technology. “If it’s China and not the United States determining the future of AI on the planet, I think that the stakes of that are just profound," former White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said at the time. At the House Republican retreat this week, Trump said he hoped DeepSeek’s success would remind U.S. tech companies that “we need to be laser-focused on competing.” Trump has signed an executive order on AI to repeal any government policies that “act as barriers to American AI innovation” and, on Jan. 21, announced that his administration was closely working with the Oracle Corporation, OpenAI and SoftBank on his $500 billion AI venture, “Stargate.” At her first press briefing on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the National Security Council is "looking into" any potential security concerns related to DeepSeek. Leavitt said that while Trump feels confident that "we'll restore American dominance" in the AI field, DeepSeek's success is because the Biden administration "sat on its hands and allowed China to rapidly develop this AI program." (DeepSeek had obtained some of its advanced chips for AI programming before former President Joe Biden's executive order restricting AI chip exports to Chinese tech companies went into effect.) A 16-year-old boy was apprehended by Nebraska officials on Monday night after allegedly eluding police by driving a Corvette on the highway at up to 168 miles per hour. Palestinian health authorities said an Israeli airstrike in the northern West Bank killed at least 10 people late Wednesday, as Israeli forces have carried out a major crackdown in the occupied territory during the ceasefire in Gaza. Israel's military said a fighter jet targeted a Palestinian militant cell based on intelligence. Hamas mourned the men killed but did not claim them as members. The jury is still out on whether the Chinese AI upstart DeepSeek is a game changer or part of an elaborate plan by its hedge fund parent company to short Nvidia and other tech stocks. Whichever it might be (maybe both?), DeepSeek and its large language model have made some major waves.

Niccol called out mobile ordering as a bottleneck five times during the call, and said the company -- which on Tuesday posted a smaller-than-expected drop in comparable sales -- would work toward sequencing mobile orders with the help of an algorithm to improve efficiency behind the counter. A strong case can be made for XRP (Ripple) (CRYPTO: XRP). In recent months, XRP has delivered gains that trounced all of the best-known cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE). Technology stocks were rocked to their core Monday after claims made by a Chinese start-up threatened to upend the existing artificial intelligence (AI) paradigm. At the time of this writing, the stock is up 168% over the last 12 months, beating out Nvidia and other high-profile technology names. Analysts have recently upgraded their price targets on the stock, including one at Morgan Stanley who has a $140 target on it, which would equate to a 36% upside.

While this approach can lead to life-changing wealth, there's another option that could supercharge your savings with far less effort: buying exchange-traded funds (ETFs). S&P 500 ETFs include all of the stocks listed in the S&P 500 index, for example, while industry-specific ETFs only include stocks from a particular sector of the market. Such terminology gives potential investors unrealistic expectations. The stock is 46% off its 2024 all-time high, but it is still more than 500% higher than at the beginning of 2024. The stock initially rose swiftly before being crushed by the 2022 tech dive due to some financial question marks. The stocks in the S&P 500, for instance, average a yield of just 1.3%. It would mean you have to invest around $77,000 in S&P 500 stocks to expect to collect just $1,000 in dividends over the course of a full year. The good news, however, is that there are quality stocks that pay yields of well over double that rate, and they aren't risky or expensive investments, either. To aid you in your search, here are two industry-leading companies that possess strong competitive advantages that could potentially lead to a lifetime of compounding returns for investors. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) stock hit a new high this month of $200.
