Hoka sneakers are comfortable and supportive, but they come at a premium price. While many of the brand’s designs retail for $150 or more, you can get them for less by shopping some of our favorite Hoka deals below. Right now, you can score discounts on five women’s styles and six men’s styles, including 19% off our gear team’s pick for the best trail running shoe overall, the Hoka Speedgoat 5. You can save as much as 50% on a fresh pair of sneakers with this week's best Hoka deals. In addition to landing a spot on our list of the best trail running shoes, we also named a Hoka style one of the best shoes for standing all day. Whether you’re a walker, runner or simply looking for a colorful pair of sneakers to complement your athleisure, these are the best Hoka deals available right now. Hoka This sneaker is our gear team’s pick for the best trail running shoe overall. It’s comfortable with tons of cushion and lighter than the previous iteration. This discount is only available in three colorways, but a solid range of sizes. Hoka If you’re not sold on the Speedgoat 5, check out the Torrent 3, on sale for 20% off. The style is also designed for trail running, featuring a durable outsole, low-profile cushioning and neutral support. You can shop three colors at the moment, but sizing is limited. REI Avid hikers will appreciate this boot’s ample cushioning and Hubble heel design (for smoother heel-to-toe movement). The shoe is also waterproof and has a more streamlined aesthetic than your classic hiking boot. This discount is currently available in the color pictured above. Hoka We named the Hoka Arahi 7, which is designed to keep your feet from overpronating, the best cushioned sneaker for arch support (as well as the best stability running shoe for men). This discount is only available in the pictured colorway, but most sizes are still in stock. Dick's Sporting Goods Designed to balance cushion with a streamlined silhouette, this lightweight shoe is great for racing and daily runs. Four colors are currently on sale—some for even less—but the pictured colorway has the widest range of sizes available. Nordstrom You can find two colorways of the Mach 5 on sale for an impressive 44% off right now. (More colors are on sale for $112, if you don’t mind spending a bit more.) The lightweight shoe has a breathable mesh upper and low-profile cushion that gives it a snappy push-off that runners love. Hoka This streamlined sneaker is made for serious trail runners. It has a breathable, fitted upper that keeps debris out and a grippy sole that’s firm and low to the ground for better push-off. This discount is available directly from Hoka in six colors. Hoka As we mentioned in the women’s section above, this grippy and well-cushioned sneaker is our pick for the best trail running shoe overall. You can score the men’s version for 19% off in two colorways at the moment. Nordstrom Rack Designed for walking and running, this sneaker is breathable and super supportive without feeling overly heavy. The men’s Hoka Arahi 6 is currently on sale in three colorways, though the pictured combination has the widest selection of sizes. Dick's Sporting Goods The sneaker has a thick lug sole that’s extra grippy on the pavement and great for trail running. If you like the blue-and-yellow colorway above, it’s currently on sale for 25% off when you add the shoe to your cart. (This style is also on sale in two other colorways directly from Hoka for a slightly lesser discount. ) Nordstrom Rack Designed for racers, the Carbon X 3 has a meta-rocker sole for extra propulsion and a neutral, streamlined fit. This deal is currently available in two colors, both with a solid array of sizes to choose from. Hoka rarely offers sitewide sales. That said, its sale section is often stocked with older designs for as much as 40% off. You can also typically find deals on Hoka sneakers from third-party retailers like REI and Dick’s Sporting Goods. Yes, select Hoka styles have been awarded the podiatric APMA Seal of Acceptance. This means podiatrists have reviewed the shoes and agreed that a number of Hoka’s cushioned designs are beneficial to overall foot health. Our editors named the Hoka Clifton 9 sneaker the best cushioned walking shoe for women and the best men’s walking shoe for flat feet. The style is plush and supportive without feeling overly bulky. But they won’t work for everyone—the best walking shoe for you depends on a variety of factors, including how high your arches are and how you walk. For instance, we recommend skipping the Hoka Clifton 9 if you have especially narrow feet. The brand recommends replacing your Hokas between 250 and 500 miles, depending on individual wear. Pay attention to signs like increased muscle fatigue, uneven wear patterns and discomfort to identify when it’s time to trade in an older pair. Hokas have been popularized online for their outstanding comfort and support. They have a super-plush midsole that helps with shock ab... (truncated)

The Wall Street Journal noted last week that American shareholders will lose tens of billions of dollars in investment income from their stock holdings in Silicon Valley companies like Google and Apple if several European Union sham lawsuits prevail.The EU’s courts outrageously ruled this week that Apple shareholders owe Europe 13.5 billion euros in back taxes because the company took advantage of Ireland’s low 12.5% tax rate. The EU “competition chief” declared that this sham court decision “is a big win for European citizens and tax justice.” No, it’s a big win for big government.Google shareholders are now forced to pay the EU $2.7 billion because its search engine has become dominant in the European market. The European search engines are so inferior that nobody wants to use them. So, sue American companies.Let’s be clear here: The EU laggards are simply green with envy. The Eurozone has been crushed by American tech dominance. No company in socialist Europe has found a way to compete with American innovation at Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta and so on. Since they can’t compete, they invent sore-loser lawsuits.The bigger issue is why the Biden administration isn’t defending American companies from European extortion. These tech lawsuits are a tax on American knowhow and innovation. Instead of defending American shareholders from the EU predators, the Biden regulators give legitimacy to the foreign courts. How can the U.S. government complain against specious antitrust attacks against Google and Apple when our own regulators at the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department are bringing copycat lawsuits against our tech giants in U.S. courts?The capricious fine against Google is a result of an American company shopping around the globe to find the lowest tax climate (Ireland) for doing business. This is illegal? Our corporate tax rate thanks to the Trump tax cut is now 21%, down from 35% under former President Barack Obama. But President Joe Biden and now presidential candidate Kamala Harris want to raise it back up to 28% or more. That only encourages more jobs and investment to move offshore. Did I mention that Ireland’s rate is just 12.5%?Instead of lowering the rates here, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen wants to force Ireland and other low-tax countries to raise their rates to a global minimum tax of 15% or more.Similarly, antitrust lawsuits from Europe and Washington aimed at American tech companies are spurious because nearly every price for tech services — from cellphones to drone deliveries to internet searches to fiber optic hookups — has been falling. How are consumers getting gouged if they keep paying less? I often don’t like the politics of Big Tech. But the end result of what Washington is doing to penalize American tech giants for building a better mousetrap is to move the high-tech hubs of the world — from Silicon Valley to Austin to Boston to Miami — to competitor nations. That’s a good way to lose jobs and put America last.Stephen Moore is a cofounder of Unleash Prosperity. He is also an economic advisor to the Trump campaign.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / SEPTEMBER 20 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom.

Title: LVMH's Bernard Arnault has gone from the world's richest person to flirting with 5th place after a $54 billion wipeout

Bernard Arnault was the richest person on the planet six months ago; now he's flirting with fifth place. Arnault is the founder and CEO of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the French luxury-goods behemoth. In late March, he was worth an estimated $231 billion, ranking him ahead of Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos at the top of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The fashion tycoon's fortune has shrunk by $54 billion since then to $177 billion at Wednesday's close. That places him fourth and only $1 billion ahead of the Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison. Arnault's net worth has tanked by $30 billion this year, making him the biggest wealth loser among the 500 individuals on Bloomberg's list. He's also the only person among the 18 richest people who's in the red for 2024; the others have all gained at least $14 billion and as much as $63 billion. Forbes' wealth rankings tell a similar story: Arnault has dropped from first place, with a $233 billion net worth on March 8, to fifth, with a $175 billion fortune, behind Musk, Bezos, Ellison, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The wealth hit for the "Wolf in Cashmere" reflects a 16% slump in LVMH's stock price to its lowest level in two years. Arnault owns about 48% of the luxury conglomerate, which houses around 75 brands, including Tiffany & Co., Louis Vuitton, Dom Perignon, and Sephora. LVMH shares have been hit by the company's troubles. It struggled in the first half of this year with underlying revenues inching up only 2% and income from recurring operations sliding 8%. Underlying profits tanked 26% in the wines and spirits business, 19% in watches and jewelry, and 6% in the key fashion and leather goods segment. Arnault also warned of a "climate of economic and geopolitical uncertainty" in the earnings release. Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported last month that Sephora was slashing its 4,000-person workforce in China by 10% to weather a challenging local market. The luxury industry boomed after the pandemic as travel resumed and pent-up shopping demand was released. But it has struggled more recently as historic inflation, steeper interest rates, and recession fears have tempered demand even among wealthy consumers. Jump to
