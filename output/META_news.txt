You are expected to deliver a seamless, relevant experience for every single customer—true 1-to-1 personalisation—yet you are often armed with a fragmented stack of tools that treat your customers like rows in a spreadsheet. To overcome this, you need to consolidate customer data from all digital platforms, such as your website, social media, SMS, and mobile apps, to create a unified view of each customer.Currently, you might have an email platform for newsletters, a separate tool for SMS, a siloed system for customer support, and ad managers that don’t talk to your CRM. The result? A disjointed customer experience where a VIP shopper is treated like a stranger the moment they switch from their laptop to their mobile phone. Integrating these tools is essential to avoid data silos and enable a seamless customer experience across all touchpoints.This is where omnichannel marketing automation becomes more than just a buzzword; it becomes the fundamental requirement for survival and growth in the European eCommerce market.

This is where omnichannel marketing automation becomes more than just a buzzword; it becomes the fundamental requirement for survival and growth in the European eCommerce market. Why Multichannel is Not OmnichannelBefore we talk about the basics, we must clear up some common misconceptions. Many businesses believe they are practising omnichannel marketing simply because they are present on multiple channels.However, if you are sending emails, running Facebook ads, and offering SMS updates without a unified strategy, you might still only be doing multichannel marketing.Multichannel Marketing is channel-centric. The strategy focuses on the medium: “How do we grow our email list?” or “How do we get more clicks on Instagram?” These channels operate in silos, often competing with each other and confusing the customer.Omnichannel Marketing is customer-centric. The strategy focuses on the individual: “How do we move this specific customer to their next purchase?” The channels are merely the delivery mechanism, all connected to a single brain, making a customer-centric model possible through unified workflows.Omnichannel marketing automation is the technological infrastructure that makes this possible. It is the ability to orchestrate a unified workflow where a customer’s action on one channel (e.g., viewing a product on the mobile app) instantly triggers a relevant reaction on another channel (e.g., a personalised email or a web pop-up), without any manual intervention. Ultimately, omnichannel marketing automation is essential for delivering a consistent experience across all touchpoints.The Foundation: You Must Analyse Customer Data FirstThe first step in any successful omnichannel marketing automation strategy is to consolidate and analyse customer data.The single biggest reason omnichannel marketing automation strategies fail is not a lack of creative ideas, but a lack of unified data. You cannot automate a relationship with someone you don’t recognise.To achieve true personalisation, you must move beyond basic demographics by understanding customer behaviours and preferences. You need a Customer Data Platform (CDP) capability that consolidates customer data from every source:Zero-Party Data: Preferences they have explicitly told you (e.g., “I am interested in Men’s Running Shoes”).First-Party Data: Behavioural signals (clicks, views, time on site) and transactional history.Only when you analyse customer data in a unified 360 profile can you stop blasting generic messages and start designing personal journeys.The Framework: The 4 C’s of Omnichannel MarketingIf you search for “What are the 4 C’s of omnichannel?”, you will find many academic definitions. However, for practical reasons we define the 4 C’s as the pillars of a successful omnichannel marketing automation strategy. These four pillars are crucial for building an effective strategy that scales.1. ConsistencyYour brand must sound, look, and behave the same way everywhere. Omnichannel marketing automation ensures that if a customer uses a discount code from an email, that code works instantly on the mobile app, and the banner on the website acknowledges that they have already claimed the offer. Inconsistency breeds distrust; consistency builds loyalty.2. ContextContext is the “Why” and “When” behind the message. Sending a “We Miss You” coupon to a customer who just made a purchase yesterday is a failure of context. A robust marketing automation platform uses real-time data to suppress irrelevant messages and trigger the right ones based on the customer’s current status in the lifecycle (e.g., Active, At Risk, Churning).Automation can also wait for the optimal moment, such as pausing before sending a follow-up SMS or email, based on customer behaviour, ensuring messages are delivered when they are most relevant.3. ConvenienceWe live in an attention economy. Your customers are mobile-first and distraction-prone. Omnichannel marketing is about being present on the channel that is most convenient for them, not you. For some, that is WhatsApp; for others, it is a Web Push notification. Automation allows you to route messages to the channel with the highest probability of engagement for that specific user. It can also pick the optimal time and channel to send messages, maximizing engagement through features like send time optimisation (STO).4. ConversationThe era of the “monologue”, brands talking at customers, is over. Modern customer engagement is a dialogue. Conversational marketing tools help brands engage customers in real-time across multiple channels, ensuring interactions happen at the right moments and touchpoints.This means integrating conversational marketing (Live Chat, AI Bots) into your automation flows. If a customer replies to an automation, the system must be smart enough to route that to a human agent or an AI assistant, rather than hitting a “no-reply” wall.7 Omnichannel Assets You Must ActivateTo execute this strategy, you need more than good intentions. You need a specific set of tools working in harmony. We identify these as the 7 Strategic Assets of a comprehensive omnichannel marketing automation platform.These platforms offer key capabilities such as advanced personalisation, audience segmentation, and journey orchestration, enabling seamless and effective omnichannel campaigns. Activating all seven assets delivers significant advantages, including improved efficiency, greater flexibility, enhanced customer experience, and better decision-making for your business.1. The Central Brain (CDP)This is the heart of your operation. It is the repository where all customer data lives. Without this “Brain,” your marketing automation tools are just disparate instruments playing different songs. The Central Brain allows you to create dynamic segments, like “high spenders who haven’t visited in 30 days”, which update in real-time across all other assets. By tracking customer accounts, you can personalise engagement and segmentation based on each account's behaviours and preferences.2. The Retention Engine (Email Studio)Email remains the highest ROI channel, but only if it evolves beyond “batch-and-blast.” As a core component of omnichannel marketing automation, email marketing plays a crucial role in creating personalised campaigns that integrate data from multiple touchpoints, ensuring a consistent customer experience across all channels. Your Retention Engine must support dynamic content—blocks of the email that change based on who is opening it.Hint: A single email campaign sent to 100,000 people should look like 100,000 different emails, with product recommendations tailored specifically to each user’s browsing history.3. The Mobile Bridge (SMS & Mobile Push)Mobile channels are your bridge to immediate action. Integrating various channels like SMS, mobile push, and in-app notifications enhances the immediacy and reach of marketing campaigns. With open rates often exceeding 90%, SMS is a powerful asset for time-sensitive marketing campaigns.Hint: Use mobile for “Flash Sales” or urgent “Back in Stock” notifications where speed is the primary value driver.4. The On-site Concierge (Website Personalisation)Your website should not be a static brochure; it should be a living environment. This asset uses marketing automation to change the website interface based on the visitor.Hint: If a visitor is browsing "Winter Jackets," the homepage banner should automatically switch to feature your best-selling parkas, and a pop-up should offer a "Winter Guide" in exchange for their email address.5. The Conversation Hub (Contact Centre & Chat)Following our acquisitions of Leadoo and Thulium, SALESmanago emphasises that support is marketing. The Conversation Hub connects your service team to the automation data.Hint: When a VIP customer initiates a chat, the agent immediately sees their customer lifetime value and recent purchases, allowing them to offer a personalised upsell or a “thank you” gift. Personalised support in the Conversation Hub leads to higher customer satisfaction.6. The Ad ConnectorYour omnichannel marketing strategy must extend beyond your own properties. The Ad Connector syncs your CDP segments with ad platforms like Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and Google Ads.Hint: You can automatically stop showing ads to customers who have already purchased the product. This saves budget and reduces advertising cost by targeting only relevant audiences, directly improving the customer experience.7. The Prediction Layer (AI)Finally, the modern growth stack requires intelligence. The Prediction Layer uses AI to look forward, not just backward. It predicts customer behaviour, such as the likelihood of churn or the probability of purchase, allowing you to trigger automations before the customer even acts. AI can also help identify the potential of customers, enabling targeted outreach to those most likely to engage and convert.Build Your Omnichannel Marketing Automation StrategyNow that you understand the assets, how do you build the structure? To implement an effective omnichannel marketing automation strategy, you need to follow a series of steps that coordinate your efforts across multiple channels for maximum impact. A successful strategy is built in three phases.Step 1: Map the Connected Customer JourneyStop thinking in linear funnels. The modern customer journey is a loop. Map out the key touchpoints where value can be added and engage customers across different channels:Discovery: social media, organic search.Interest: website browsing, newsletter signup.Consideration: cart addition, price comparison.Purchase: transaction, delivery tracking.Retention: support, feedback, repurchase.You must ensure the customer journey can continue seamlessly as customers move between different channels. Identify where the friction points are. Where are people dropping off? That is where omnichannel marketing automation must be deployed.Step 2: Unify and Segment Your DataBefore building workflows, define your logic. We recommend using RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) as a starting point.Champions: Buy often, spend a lot, bought recently.Loyal Customers: Buy regularly.Hibernating: Used to buy, but haven't in a while.Each of these groups requires a completely different omnichannel marketing approach.Step 3: Orchestrate the "Money Maker" WorkflowsDon’t try to automate everything at once. Start with the high-impact marketing campaigns that drive immediate revenue. Automation streamlines tasks that would otherwise require a manual process, allowing you to efficiently manage activities across multiple channels. Here are examples of omnichannel marketing workflows you can build today:Example A: The Omnichannel Abandoned CartInstead of a simple email, use a cascading workflow to maximise recovery rates.Trigger: Customer leaves items in the cart.1 Hour Later (Email): Send a helpful reminder with the cart contents. “Did you forget this?”24 Hours Later (Check Channel): Has the email been opened?If YES but no purchase: Send a second email with social proof (reviews).If NO open: Trigger an SMS with a short, direct link to the cart.3 Days Later (Web): When they return to the site, show a personalised pop-up offering free shipping if they complete the order today.To further optimise your omnichannel marketing automation, use A/B testing to compare different versions of your abandoned cart messages across email, SMS, and web pop-ups. By running A/B tests, you can determine which message formats, subject lines, or offers most effectively engage your audience. Measure the impact of each variation on CTR (clickthrough rate) to identify which approach drives the highest engagement and conversions. This data-driven method ensures you continually improve your workflow for maximum recovery rates.Example B: The VIP Nurture LoopFocus on customer lifetime value by treating your best buyers differently.Trigger: Customer enters the “Champion” segment (based on RFM score).Immediate Action (Email): Send a “Welcome to VIP” email with an exclusive unlocking of early access to new collections.Ongoing (Web Personalisation): Permanently change their navigation bar on the website to highlight “VIP Offers.”Special Occasion (Direct Mail/Mobile): Send a birthday wish via SMS and, if the value is high enough, trigger a notification to your team to send a handwritten note.By leveraging targeted communications throughout this workflow, you can deliver personalised messaging that increases engagement and loyalty among VIP customers.AI and the Future of AutomationThe complexity of managing these journeys across so many channels can be daunting for marketing teams. This is where Artificial Intelligence becomes your partner, not just a tool.At SALESmanago, our AI Sidekick is designed to take the heavy lifting out of omnichannel marketing automation. It moves you from “Reactive” to “Predictive.” AI also helps refine your marketing strategies by analysing key metrics from each channel, allowing you to make data-driven adjustments for greater effectiveness.Content Generation: Instead of spending hours writing copy for 10 different email variations, Generative AI can create subject lines, body copy, and even image suggestions that match your brand tone instantly.Send Time Optimisation: AI analyses individual customer behaviour to determine that User A is most likely to open emails at 8:00 AM on a Tuesday, while User B engages with SMS at 6:00 PM on a Friday. The system then automatically schedules the message for that precise moment.By automating daily tasks with AI, you achieve the best results and improve the overall effectiveness of your campaigns. By leveraging AI, you ensure that your omnichannel marketing automation strategy scales with your business. You stop being a tactician manually pulling levers and become a strategist overseeing a self-optimising engine.Conclusion: From Tactician to Growth StrategistOmnichannel marketing automation is not just about efficiency; it is about empathy at scale. It is about acknowledging that your customer is a single person, regardless of whether they are on Instagram, in their inbox, or on your mobile app. Omnichannel marketing automation is essential for the success of modern marketing teams, enabling them to deliver consistent and impactful experiences across every touchpoint.By implementing a unified marketing automation platform, you eliminate the silos that frustrate customers and leak revenue. You gain the power to deliver a superior customer experience that feels personal, timely, and relevant, achieving superior results that make the investment worth the effort.Ready to stop managing channels and start orchestrating growth?Explore the SALESmanago Growth Framework and see how your business can evolve from a Scaling Store to an eCommerce Innovator.Visual Summary Before we talk about the basics, we must clear up some common misconceptions.

The strategy focuses on the individual: “How do we move this specific customer to their next purchase?” The channels are merely the delivery mechanism, all connected to a single brain, making a customer-centric model possible through unified workflows.Omnichannel marketing automation is the technological infrastructure that makes this possible. It is the ability to orchestrate a unified workflow where a customer’s action on one channel (e.g., viewing a product on the mobile app) instantly triggers a relevant reaction on another channel (e.g., a personalised email or a web pop-up), without any manual intervention. Ultimately, omnichannel marketing automation is essential for delivering a consistent experience across all touchpoints.The Foundation: You Must Analyse Customer Data FirstThe first step in any successful omnichannel marketing automation strategy is to consolidate and analyse customer data.The single biggest reason omnichannel marketing automation strategies fail is not a lack of creative ideas, but a lack of unified data. You cannot automate a relationship with someone you don’t recognise.To achieve true personalisation, you must move beyond basic demographics by understanding customer behaviours and preferences. You need a Customer Data Platform (CDP) capability that consolidates customer data from every source:Zero-Party Data: Preferences they have explicitly told you (e.g., “I am interested in Men’s Running Shoes”).First-Party Data: Behavioural signals (clicks, views, time on site) and transactional history.Only when you analyse customer data in a unified 360 profile can you stop blasting generic messages and start designing personal journeys.The Framework: The 4 C’s of Omnichannel MarketingIf you search for “What are the 4 C’s of omnichannel?”, you will find many academic definitions. However, for practical reasons we define the 4 C’s as the pillars of a successful omnichannel marketing automation strategy. These four pillars are crucial for building an effective strategy that scales.1. ConsistencyYour brand must sound, look, and behave the same way everywhere. Omnichannel marketing automation ensures that if a customer uses a discount code from an email, that code works instantly on the mobile app, and the banner on the website acknowledges that they have already claimed the offer. Inconsistency breeds distrust; consistency builds loyalty.2. ContextContext is the “Why” and “When” behind the message. Sending a “We Miss You” coupon to a customer who just made a purchase yesterday is a failure of context. A robust marketing automation platform uses real-time data to suppress irrelevant messages and trigger the right ones based on the customer’s current status in the lifecycle (e.g., Active, At Risk, Churning).Automation can also wait for the optimal moment, such as pausing before sending a follow-up SMS or email, based on customer behaviour, ensuring messages are delivered when they are most relevant.3. ConvenienceWe live in an attention economy. Your customers are mobile-first and distraction-prone. Omnichannel marketing is about being present on the channel that is most convenient for them, not you. For some, that is WhatsApp; for others, it is a Web Push notification. Automation allows you to route messages to the channel with the highest probability of engagement for that specific user. It can also pick the optimal time and channel to send messages, maximizing engagement through features like send time optimisation (STO).4. ConversationThe era of the “monologue”, brands talking at customers, is over. Modern customer engagement is a dialogue. Conversational marketing tools help brands engage customers in real-time across multiple channels, ensuring interactions happen at the right moments and touchpoints.This means integrating conversational marketing (Live Chat, AI Bots) into your automation flows. If a customer replies to an automation, the system must be smart enough to route that to a human agent or an AI assistant, rather than hitting a “no-reply” wall.7 Omnichannel Assets You Must ActivateTo execute this strategy, you need more than good intentions. You need a specific set of tools working in harmony. We identify these as the 7 Strategic Assets of a comprehensive omnichannel marketing automation platform.These platforms offer key capabilities such as advanced personalisation, audience segmentation, and journey orchestration, enabling seamless and effective omnichannel campaigns. Activating all seven assets delivers significant advantages, including improved efficiency, greater flexibility, enhanced customer experience, and better decision-making for your business.1. The Central Brain (CDP)This is the heart of your operation. It is the repository where all customer data lives. Without this “Brain,” your marketing automation tools are just disparate instruments playing different songs. The Central Brain allows you to create dynamic segments, like “high spenders who haven’t visited in 30 days”, which update in real-time across all other assets. By tracking customer accounts, you can personalise engagement and segmentation based on each account's behaviours and preferences.2. The Retention Engine (Email Studio)Email remains the highest ROI channel, but only if it evolves beyond “batch-and-blast.” As a core component of omnichannel marketing automation, email marketing plays a crucial role in creating personalised campaigns that integrate data from multiple touchpoints, ensuring a consistent customer experience across all channels. Your Retention Engine must support dynamic content—blocks of the email that change based on who is opening it.Hint: A single email campaign sent to 100,000 people should look like 100,000 different emails, with product recommendations tailored specifically to each user’s browsing history.3. The Mobile Bridge (SMS & Mobile Push)Mobile channels are your bridge to immediate action. Integrating various channels like SMS, mobile push, and in-app notifications enhances the immediacy and reach of marketing campaigns. With open rates often exceeding 90%, SMS is a powerful asset for time-sensitive marketing campaigns.Hint: Use mobile for “Flash Sales” or urgent “Back in Stock” notifications where speed is the primary value driver.4. The On-site Concierge (Website Personalisation)Your website should not be a static brochure; it should be a living environment. This asset uses marketing automation to change the website interface based on the visitor.Hint: If a visitor is browsing "Winter Jackets," the homepage banner should automatically switch to feature your best-selling parkas, and a pop-up should offer a "Winter Guide" in exchange for their email address.5. The Conversation Hub (Contact Centre & Chat)Following our acquisitions of Leadoo and Thulium, SALESmanago emphasises that support is marketing. The Conversation Hub connects your service team to the automation data.Hint: When a VIP customer initiates a chat, the agent immediately sees their customer lifetime value and recent purchases, allowing them to offer a personalised upsell or a “thank you” gift. Personalised support in the Conversation Hub leads to higher customer satisfaction.6. The Ad ConnectorYour omnichannel marketing strategy must extend beyond your own properties. The Ad Connector syncs your CDP segments with ad platforms like Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and Google Ads.Hint: You can automatically stop showing ads to customers who have already purchased the product. This saves budget and reduces advertising cost by targeting only relevant audiences, directly improving the customer experience.7. The Prediction Layer (AI)Finally, the modern growth stack requires intelligence. The Prediction Layer uses AI to look forward, not just backward. It predicts customer behaviour, such as the likelihood of churn or the probability of purchase, allowing you to trigger automations before the customer even acts. AI can also help identify the potential of customers, enabling targeted outreach to those most likely to engage and convert.Build Your Omnichannel Marketing Automation StrategyNow that you understand the assets, how do you build the structure? To implement an effective omnichannel marketing automation strategy, you need to follow a series of steps that coordinate your efforts across multiple channels for maximum impact. A successful strategy is built in three phases.Step 1: Map the Connected Customer JourneyStop thinking in linear funnels. The modern customer journey is a loop. Map out the key touchpoints where value can be added and engage customers across different channels:Discovery: social media, organic search.Interest: website browsing, newsletter signup.Consideration: cart addition, price comparison.Purchase: transaction, delivery tracking.Retention: support, feedback, repurchase.You must ensure the customer journey can continue seamlessly as customers move between different channels. Identify where the friction points are. Where are people dropping off? That is where omnichannel marketing automation must be deployed.Step 2: Unify and Segment Your DataBefore building workflows, define your logic. We recommend using RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) as a starting point.Champions: Buy often, spend a lot, bought recently.Loyal Customers: Buy regularly.Hibernating: Used to buy, but haven't in a while.Each of these groups requires a completely different omnichannel marketing approach.Step 3: Orchestrate the "Money Maker" WorkflowsDon’t try to automate everything at once. Start with the high-impact marketing campaigns that drive immediate revenue. Automation streamlines tasks that would otherwise require a manual process, allowing you to efficiently manage activities across multiple channels. Here are examples of omnichannel marketing workflows you can build today:Example A: The Omnichannel Abandoned CartInstead of a simple email, use a cascading workflow to maximise recovery rates.Trigger: Customer leaves items in the cart.1 Hour Later (Email): Send a helpful reminder with the cart contents. “Did you forget this?”24 Hours Later (Check Channel): Has the email been opened?If YES but no purchase: Send a second email with social proof (reviews).If NO open: Trigger an SMS with a short, direct link to the cart.3 Days Later (Web): When they return to the site, show a personalised pop-up offering free shipping if they complete the order today.To further optimise your omnichannel marketing automation, use A/B testing to compare different versions of your abandoned cart messages across email, SMS, and web pop-ups. By running A/B tests, you can determine which message formats, subject lines, or offers most effectively engage your audience. Measure the impact of each variation on CTR (clickthrough rate) to identify which approach drives the highest engagement and conversions. This data-driven method ensures you continually improve your workflow for maximum recovery rates.Example B: The VIP Nurture LoopFocus on customer lifetime value by treating your best buyers differently.Trigger: Customer enters the “Champion” segment (based on RFM score).Immediate Action (Email): Send a “Welcome to VIP” email with an exclusive unlocking of early access to new collections.Ongoing (Web Personalisation): Permanently change their navigation bar on the website to highlight “VIP Offers.”Special Occasion (Direct Mail/Mobile): Send a birthday wish via SMS and, if the value is high enough, trigger a notification to your team to send a handwritten note.By leveraging targeted communications throughout this workflow, you can deliver personalised messaging that increases engagement and loyalty among VIP customers.AI and the Future of AutomationThe complexity of managing these journeys across so many channels can be daunting for marketing teams. This is where Artificial Intelligence becomes your partner, not just a tool.At SALESmanago, our AI Sidekick is designed to take the heavy lifting out of omnichannel marketing automation. It moves you from “Reactive” to “Predictive.” AI also helps refine your marketing strategies by analysing key metrics from each channel, allowing you to make data-driven adjustments for greater effectiveness.Content Generation: Instead of spending hours writing copy for 10 different email variations, Generative AI can create subject lines, body copy, and even image suggestions that match your brand tone instantly.Send Time Optimisation: AI analyses individual customer behaviour to determine that User A is most likely to open emails at 8:00 AM on a Tuesday, while User B engages with SMS at 6:00 PM on a Friday. The system then automatically schedules the message for that precise moment.By automating daily tasks with AI, you achieve the best results and improve the overall effectiveness of your campaigns. By leveraging AI, you ensure that your omnichannel marketing automation strategy scales with your business. You stop being a tactician manually pulling levers and become a strategist overseeing a self-optimising engine.Conclusion: From Tactician to Growth StrategistOmnichannel marketing automation is not just about efficiency; it is about empathy at scale. It is about acknowledging that your customer is a single person, regardless of whether they are on Instagram, in their inbox, or on your mobile app. Omnichannel marketing automation is essential for the success of modern marketing teams, enabling them to deliver consistent and impactful experiences across every touchpoint.By implementing a unified marketing automation platform, you eliminate the silos that frustrate customers and leak revenue. You gain the power to deliver a superior customer experience that feels personal, timely, and relevant, achieving superior results that make the investment worth the effort.Ready to stop managing channels and start orchestrating growth?Explore the SALESmanago Growth Framework and see how your business can evolve from a Scaling Store to an eCommerce Innovator.Visual Summary Multichannel Marketing is channel-centric.

By leveraging AI, you ensure that your omnichannel marketing automation strategy scales with your business. You stop being a tactician manually pulling levers and become a strategist overseeing a self-optimising engine.Conclusion: From Tactician to Growth StrategistOmnichannel marketing automation is not just about efficiency; it is about empathy at scale. It is about acknowledging that your customer is a single person, regardless of whether they are on Instagram, in their inbox, or on your mobile app. Omnichannel marketing automation is essential for the success of modern marketing teams, enabling them to deliver consistent and impactful experiences across every touchpoint.By implementing a unified marketing automation platform, you eliminate the silos that frustrate customers and leak revenue. You gain the power to deliver a superior customer experience that feels personal, timely, and relevant, achieving superior results that make the investment worth the effort.Ready to stop managing channels and start orchestrating growth?Explore the SALESmanago Growth Framework and see how your business can evolve from a Scaling Store to an eCommerce Innovator.Visual Summary The single biggest reason omnichannel marketing automation strategies fail is not a lack of creative ideas, but a lack of unified data. You cannot automate a relationship with someone you don’t recognise.To achieve true personalisation, you must move beyond basic demographics by understanding customer behaviours and preferences. You need a Customer Data Platform (CDP) capability that consolidates customer data from every source:Zero-Party Data: Preferences they have explicitly told you (e.g., “I am interested in Men’s Running Shoes”).First-Party Data: Behavioural signals (clicks, views, time on site) and transactional history.Only when you analyse customer data in a unified 360 profile can you stop blasting generic messages and start designing personal journeys.The Framework: The 4 C’s of Omnichannel MarketingIf you search for “What are the 4 C’s of omnichannel?”, you will find many academic definitions. However, for practical reasons we define the 4 C’s as the pillars of a successful omnichannel marketing automation strategy. These four pillars are crucial for building an effective strategy that scales.1. ConsistencyYour brand must sound, look, and behave the same way everywhere. Omnichannel marketing automation ensures that if a customer uses a discount code from an email, that code works instantly on the mobile app, and the banner on the website acknowledges that they have already claimed the offer. Inconsistency breeds distrust; consistency builds loyalty.2. ContextContext is the “Why” and “When” behind the message. Sending a “We Miss You” coupon to a customer who just made a purchase yesterday is a failure of context. A robust marketing automation platform uses real-time data to suppress irrelevant messages and trigger the right ones based on the customer’s current status in the lifecycle (e.g., Active, At Risk, Churning).Automation can also wait for the optimal moment, such as pausing before sending a follow-up SMS or email, based on customer behaviour, ensuring messages are delivered when they are most relevant.3. ConvenienceWe live in an attention economy. Your customers are mobile-first and distraction-prone. Omnichannel marketing is about being present on the channel that is most convenient for them, not you. For some, that is WhatsApp; for others, it is a Web Push notification. Automation allows you to route messages to the channel with the highest probability of engagement for that specific user. It can also pick the optimal time and channel to send messages, maximizing engagement through features like send time optimisation (STO).4. ConversationThe era of the “monologue”, brands talking at customers, is over. Modern customer engagement is a dialogue. Conversational marketing tools help brands engage customers in real-time across multiple channels, ensuring interactions happen at the right moments and touchpoints.This means integrating conversational marketing (Live Chat, AI Bots) into your automation flows. If a customer replies to an automation, the system must be smart enough to route that to a human agent or an AI assistant, rather than hitting a “no-reply” wall.7 Omnichannel Assets You Must ActivateTo execute this strategy, you need more than good intentions. You need a specific set of tools working in harmony. We identify these as the 7 Strategic Assets of a comprehensive omnichannel marketing automation platform.These platforms offer key capabilities such as advanced personalisation, audience segmentation, and journey orchestration, enabling seamless and effective omnichannel campaigns. Activating all seven assets delivers significant advantages, including improved efficiency, greater flexibility, enhanced customer experience, and better decision-making for your business.1. The Central Brain (CDP)This is the heart of your operation. It is the repository where all customer data lives. Without this “Brain,” your marketing automation tools are just disparate instruments playing different songs. The Central Brain allows you to create dynamic segments, like “high spenders who haven’t visited in 30 days”, which update in real-time across all other assets. By tracking customer accounts, you can personalise engagement and segmentation based on each account's behaviours and preferences.2. The Retention Engine (Email Studio)Email remains the highest ROI channel, but only if it evolves beyond “batch-and-blast.” As a core component of omnichannel marketing automation, email marketing plays a crucial role in creating personalised campaigns that integrate data from multiple touchpoints, ensuring a consistent customer experience across all channels. Your Retention Engine must support dynamic content—blocks of the email that change based on who is opening it.Hint: A single email campaign sent to 100,000 people should look like 100,000 different emails, with product recommendations tailored specifically to each user’s browsing history.3. The Mobile Bridge (SMS & Mobile Push)Mobile channels are your bridge to immediate action. Integrating various channels like SMS, mobile push, and in-app notifications enhances the immediacy and reach of marketing campaigns. With open rates often exceeding 90%, SMS is a powerful asset for time-sensitive marketing campaigns.Hint: Use mobile for “Flash Sales” or urgent “Back in Stock” notifications where speed is the primary value driver.4. The On-site Concierge (Website Personalisation)Your website should not be a static brochure; it should be a living environment. This asset uses marketing automation to change the website interface based on the visitor.Hint: If a visitor is browsing "Winter Jackets," the homepage banner should automatically switch to feature your best-selling parkas, and a pop-up should offer a "Winter Guide" in exchange for their email address.5. The Conversation Hub (Contact Centre & Chat)Following our acquisitions of Leadoo and Thulium, SALESmanago emphasises that support is marketing. The Conversation Hub connects your service team to the automation data.Hint: When a VIP customer initiates a chat, the agent immediately sees their customer lifetime value and recent purchases, allowing them to offer a personalised upsell or a “thank you” gift. Personalised support in the Conversation Hub leads to higher customer satisfaction.6. The Ad ConnectorYour omnichannel marketing strategy must extend beyond your own properties. The Ad Connector syncs your CDP segments with ad platforms like Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and Google Ads.Hint: You can automatically stop showing ads to customers who have already purchased the product. This saves budget and reduces advertising cost by targeting only relevant audiences, directly improving the customer experience.7. The Prediction Layer (AI)Finally, the modern growth stack requires intelligence. The Prediction Layer uses AI to look forward, not just backward. It predicts customer behaviour, such as the likelihood of churn or the probability of purchase, allowing you to trigger automations before the customer even acts. AI can also help identify the potential of customers, enabling targeted outreach to those most likely to engage and convert.Build Your Omnichannel Marketing Automation StrategyNow that you understand the assets, how do you build the structure? To implement an effective omnichannel marketing automation strategy, you need to follow a series of steps that coordinate your efforts across multiple channels for maximum impact. A successful strategy is built in three phases.Step 1: Map the Connected Customer JourneyStop thinking in linear funnels. The modern customer journey is a loop. Map out the key touchpoints where value can be added and engage customers across different channels:Discovery: social media, organic search.Interest: website browsing, newsletter signup.Consideration: cart addition, price comparison.Purchase: transaction, delivery tracking.Retention: support, feedback, repurchase.You must ensure the customer journey can continue seamlessly as customers move between different channels. Identify where the friction points are. Where are people dropping off? That is where omnichannel marketing automation must be deployed.Step 2: Unify and Segment Your DataBefore building workflows, define your logic. We recommend using RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) as a starting point.Champions: Buy often, spend a lot, bought recently.Loyal Customers: Buy regularly.Hibernating: Used to buy, but haven't in a while.Each of these groups requires a completely different omnichannel marketing approach.Step 3: Orchestrate the "Money Maker" WorkflowsDon’t try to automate everything at once. Start with the high-impact marketing campaigns that drive immediate revenue. Automation streamlines tasks that would otherwise require a manual process, allowing you to efficiently manage activities across multiple channels. Here are examples of omnichannel marketing workflows you can build today:Example A: The Omnichannel Abandoned CartInstead of a simple email, use a cascading workflow to maximise recovery rates.Trigger: Customer leaves items in the cart.1 Hour Later (Email): Send a helpful reminder with the cart contents. “Did you forget this?”24 Hours Later (Check Channel): Has the email been opened?If YES but no purchase: Send a second email with social proof (reviews).If NO open: Trigger an SMS with a short, direct link to the cart.3 Days Later (Web): When they return to the site, show a personalised pop-up offering free shipping if they complete the order today.To further optimise your omnichannel marketing automation, use A/B testing to compare different versions of your abandoned cart messages across email, SMS, and web pop-ups. By running A/B tests, you can determine which message formats, subject lines, or offers most effectively engage your audience. Measure the impact of each variation on CTR (clickthrough rate) to identify which approach drives the highest engagement and conversions. This data-driven method ensures you continually improve your workflow for maximum recovery rates.Example B: The VIP Nurture LoopFocus on customer lifetime value by treating your best buyers differently.Trigger: Customer enters the “Champion” segment (based on RFM score).Immediate Action (Email): Send a “Welcome to VIP” email with an exclusive unlocking of early access to new collections.Ongoing (Web Personalisation): Permanently change their navigation bar on the website to highlight “VIP Offers.”Special Occasion (Direct Mail/Mobile): Send a birthday wish via SMS and, if the value is high enough, trigger a notification to your team to send a handwritten note.By leveraging targeted communications throughout this workflow, you can deliver personalised messaging that increases engagement and loyalty among VIP customers.AI and the Future of AutomationThe complexity of managing these journeys across so many channels can be daunting for marketing teams.

It is about acknowledging that your customer is a single person, regardless of whether they are on Instagram, in their inbox, or on your mobile app. Omnichannel marketing automation is essential for the success of modern marketing teams, enabling them to deliver consistent and impactful experiences across every touchpoint.By implementing a unified marketing automation platform, you eliminate the silos that frustrate customers and leak revenue. You gain the power to deliver a superior customer experience that feels personal, timely, and relevant, achieving superior results that make the investment worth the effort.Ready to stop managing channels and start orchestrating growth?Explore the SALESmanago Growth Framework and see how your business can evolve from a Scaling Store to an eCommerce Innovator.Visual Summary If you search for “What are the 4 C’s of omnichannel?”, you will find many academic definitions. However, for practical reasons we define the 4 C’s as the pillars of a successful omnichannel marketing automation strategy. These four pillars are crucial for building an effective strategy that scales.1. ConsistencyYour brand must sound, look, and behave the same way everywhere. Omnichannel marketing automation ensures that if a customer uses a discount code from an email, that code works instantly on the mobile app, and the banner on the website acknowledges that they have already claimed the offer. Inconsistency breeds distrust; consistency builds loyalty.2. ContextContext is the “Why” and “When” behind the message. Sending a “We Miss You” coupon to a customer who just made a purchase yesterday is a failure of context. A robust marketing automation platform uses real-time data to suppress irrelevant messages and trigger the right ones based on the customer’s current status in the lifecycle (e.g., Active, At Risk, Churning).Automation can also wait for the optimal moment, such as pausing before sending a follow-up SMS or email, based on customer behaviour, ensuring messages are delivered when they are most relevant.3. ConvenienceWe live in an attention economy. Your customers are mobile-first and distraction-prone. Omnichannel marketing is about being present on the channel that is most convenient for them, not you. For some, that is WhatsApp; for others, it is a Web Push notification. Automation allows you to route messages to the channel with the highest probability of engagement for that specific user. It can also pick the optimal time and channel to send messages, maximizing engagement through features like send time optimisation (STO).4. ConversationThe era of the “monologue”, brands talking at customers, is over. Modern customer engagement is a dialogue. Conversational marketing tools help brands engage customers in real-time across multiple channels, ensuring interactions happen at the right moments and touchpoints.This means integrating conversational marketing (Live Chat, AI Bots) into your automation flows. If a customer replies to an automation, the system must be smart enough to route that to a human agent or an AI assistant, rather than hitting a “no-reply” wall.7 Omnichannel Assets You Must ActivateTo execute this strategy, you need more than good intentions. You need a specific set of tools working in harmony. We identify these as the 7 Strategic Assets of a comprehensive omnichannel marketing automation platform.These platforms offer key capabilities such as advanced personalisation, audience segmentation, and journey orchestration, enabling seamless and effective omnichannel campaigns. Activating all seven assets delivers significant advantages, including improved efficiency, greater flexibility, enhanced customer experience, and better decision-making for your business.1. The Central Brain (CDP)This is the heart of your operation. It is the repository where all customer data lives. Without this “Brain,” your marketing automation tools are just disparate instruments playing different songs. The Central Brain allows you to create dynamic segments, like “high spenders who haven’t visited in 30 days”, which update in real-time across all other assets. By tracking customer accounts, you can personalise engagement and segmentation based on each account's behaviours and preferences.2. The Retention Engine (Email Studio)Email remains the highest ROI channel, but only if it evolves beyond “batch-and-blast.” As a core component of omnichannel marketing automation, email marketing plays a crucial role in creating personalised campaigns that integrate data from multiple touchpoints, ensuring a consistent customer experience across all channels. Your Retention Engine must support dynamic content—blocks of the email that change based on who is opening it.Hint: A single email campaign sent to 100,000 people should look like 100,000 different emails, with product recommendations tailored specifically to each user’s browsing history.3. The Mobile Bridge (SMS & Mobile Push)Mobile channels are your bridge to immediate action. Integrating various channels like SMS, mobile push, and in-app notifications enhances the immediacy and reach of marketing campaigns. With open rates often exceeding 90%, SMS is a powerful asset for time-sensitive marketing campaigns.Hint: Use mobile for “Flash Sales” or urgent “Back in Stock” notifications where speed is the primary value driver.4. The On-site Concierge (Website Personalisation)Your website should not be a static brochure; it should be a living environment. This asset uses marketing automation to change the website interface based on the visitor.Hint: If a visitor is browsing "Winter Jackets," the homepage banner should automatically switch to feature your best-selling parkas, and a pop-up should offer a "Winter Guide" in exchange for their email address.5. The Conversation Hub (Contact Centre & Chat)Following our acquisitions of Leadoo and Thulium, SALESmanago emphasises that support is marketing. The Conversation Hub connects your service team to the automation data.Hint: When a VIP customer initiates a chat, the agent immediately sees their customer lifetime value and recent purchases, allowing them to offer a personalised upsell or a “thank you” gift. Personalised support in the Conversation Hub leads to higher customer satisfaction.6. The Ad ConnectorYour omnichannel marketing strategy must extend beyond your own properties. The Ad Connector syncs your CDP segments with ad platforms like Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and Google Ads.Hint: You can automatically stop showing ads to customers who have already purchased the product. This saves budget and reduces advertising cost by targeting only relevant audiences, directly improving the customer experience.7. The Prediction Layer (AI)Finally, the modern growth stack requires intelligence. The Prediction Layer uses AI to look forward, not just backward. It predicts customer behaviour, such as the likelihood of churn or the probability of purchase, allowing you to trigger automations before the customer even acts. AI can also help identify the potential of customers, enabling targeted outreach to those most likely to engage and convert.Build Your Omnichannel Marketing Automation StrategyNow that you understand the assets, how do you build the structure? To implement an effective omnichannel marketing automation strategy, you need to follow a series of steps that coordinate your efforts across multiple channels for maximum impact. A successful strategy is built in three phases.Step 1: Map the Connected Customer JourneyStop thinking in linear funnels. The modern customer journey is a loop. Map out the key touchpoints where value can be added and engage customers across different channels:Discovery: social media, organic search.Interest: website browsing, newsletter signup.Consideration: cart addition, price comparison.Purchase: transaction, delivery tracking.Retention: support, feedback, repurchase.You must ensure the customer journey can continue seamlessly as customers move between different channels. Identify where the friction points are. Where are people dropping off? That is where omnichannel marketing automation must be deployed.Step 2: Unify and Segment Your DataBefore building workflows, define your logic. We recommend using RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) as a starting point.Champions: Buy often, spend a lot, bought recently.Loyal Customers: Buy regularly.Hibernating: Used to buy, but haven't in a while.Each of these groups requires a completely different omnichannel marketing approach.Step 3: Orchestrate the "Money Maker" WorkflowsDon’t try to automate everything at once. Start with the high-impact marketing campaigns that drive immediate revenue. Automation streamlines tasks that would otherwise require a manual process, allowing you to efficiently manage activities across multiple channels. Here are examples of omnichannel marketing workflows you can build today:Example A: The Omnichannel Abandoned CartInstead of a simple email, use a cascading workflow to maximise recovery rates.Trigger: Customer leaves items in the cart.1 Hour Later (Email): Send a helpful reminder with the cart contents. “Did you forget this?”24 Hours Later (Check Channel): Has the email been opened?If YES but no purchase: Send a second email with social proof (reviews).If NO open: Trigger an SMS with a short, direct link to the cart.3 Days Later (Web): When they return to the site, show a personalised pop-up offering free shipping if they complete the order today.To further optimise your omnichannel marketing automation, use A/B testing to compare different versions of your abandoned cart messages across email, SMS, and web pop-ups. By running A/B tests, you can determine which message formats, subject lines, or offers most effectively engage your audience. Measure the impact of each variation on CTR (clickthrough rate) to identify which approach drives the highest engagement and conversions. This data-driven method ensures you continually improve your workflow for maximum recovery rates.Example B: The VIP Nurture LoopFocus on customer lifetime value by treating your best buyers differently.Trigger: Customer enters the “Champion” segment (based on RFM score).Immediate Action (Email): Send a “Welcome to VIP” email with an exclusive unlocking of early access to new collections.Ongoing (Web Personalisation): Permanently change their navigation bar on the website to highlight “VIP Offers.”Special Occasion (Direct Mail/Mobile): Send a birthday wish via SMS and, if the value is high enough, trigger a notification to your team to send a handwritten note.By leveraging targeted communications throughout this workflow, you can deliver personalised messaging that increases engagement and loyalty among VIP customers.AI and the Future of AutomationThe complexity of managing these journeys across so many channels can be daunting for marketing teams.

Activating all seven assets delivers significant advantages, including improved efficiency, greater flexibility, enhanced customer experience, and better decision-making for your business.1. The Central Brain (CDP)This is the heart of your operation. It is the repository where all customer data lives. Without this “Brain,” your marketing automation tools are just disparate instruments playing different songs. The Central Brain allows you to create dynamic segments, like “high spenders who haven’t visited in 30 days”, which update in real-time across all other assets. By tracking customer accounts, you can personalise engagement and segmentation based on each account's behaviours and preferences.2. The Retention Engine (Email Studio)Email remains the highest ROI channel, but only if it evolves beyond “batch-and-blast.” As a core component of omnichannel marketing automation, email marketing plays a crucial role in creating personalised campaigns that integrate data from multiple touchpoints, ensuring a consistent customer experience across all channels. Your Retention Engine must support dynamic content—blocks of the email that change based on who is opening it.Hint: A single email campaign sent to 100,000 people should look like 100,000 different emails, with product recommendations tailored specifically to each user’s browsing history.3. The Mobile Bridge (SMS & Mobile Push)Mobile channels are your bridge to immediate action. Integrating various channels like SMS, mobile push, and in-app notifications enhances the immediacy and reach of marketing campaigns. With open rates often exceeding 90%, SMS is a powerful asset for time-sensitive marketing campaigns.Hint: Use mobile for “Flash Sales” or urgent “Back in Stock” notifications where speed is the primary value driver.4. The On-site Concierge (Website Personalisation)Your website should not be a static brochure; it should be a living environment. This asset uses marketing automation to change the website interface based on the visitor.Hint: If a visitor is browsing "Winter Jackets," the homepage banner should automatically switch to feature your best-selling parkas, and a pop-up should offer a "Winter Guide" in exchange for their email address.5. The Conversation Hub (Contact Centre & Chat)Following our acquisitions of Leadoo and Thulium, SALESmanago emphasises that support is marketing. The Conversation Hub connects your service team to the automation data.Hint: When a VIP customer initiates a chat, the agent immediately sees their customer lifetime value and recent purchases, allowing them to offer a personalised upsell or a “thank you” gift. Personalised support in the Conversation Hub leads to higher customer satisfaction.6. The Ad ConnectorYour omnichannel marketing strategy must extend beyond your own properties. The Ad Connector syncs your CDP segments with ad platforms like Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and Google Ads.Hint: You can automatically stop showing ads to customers who have already purchased the product. This saves budget and reduces advertising cost by targeting only relevant audiences, directly improving the customer experience.7. The Prediction Layer (AI)Finally, the modern growth stack requires intelligence. The Prediction Layer uses AI to look forward, not just backward. It predicts customer behaviour, such as the likelihood of churn or the probability of purchase, allowing you to trigger automations before the customer even acts. AI can also help identify the potential of customers, enabling targeted outreach to those most likely to engage and convert.Build Your Omnichannel Marketing Automation StrategyNow that you understand the assets, how do you build the structure? To implement an effective omnichannel marketing automation strategy, you need to follow a series of steps that coordinate your efforts across multiple channels for maximum impact. A successful strategy is built in three phases.Step 1: Map the Connected Customer JourneyStop thinking in linear funnels. The modern customer journey is a loop. Map out the key touchpoints where value can be added and engage customers across different channels:Discovery: social media, organic search.Interest: website browsing, newsletter signup.Consideration: cart addition, price comparison.Purchase: transaction, delivery tracking.Retention: support, feedback, repurchase.You must ensure the customer journey can continue seamlessly as customers move between different channels. Identify where the friction points are. Where are people dropping off? That is where omnichannel marketing automation must be deployed.Step 2: Unify and Segment Your DataBefore building workflows, define your logic. We recommend using RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) as a starting point.Champions: Buy often, spend a lot, bought recently.Loyal Customers: Buy regularly.Hibernating: Used to buy, but haven't in a while.Each of these groups requires a completely different omnichannel marketing approach.Step 3: Orchestrate the "Money Maker" WorkflowsDon’t try to automate everything at once. Start with the high-impact marketing campaigns that drive immediate revenue. Automation streamlines tasks that would otherwise require a manual process, allowing you to efficiently manage activities across multiple channels. Here are examples of omnichannel marketing workflows you can build today:Example A: The Omnichannel Abandoned CartInstead of a simple email, use a cascading workflow to maximise recovery rates.Trigger: Customer leaves items in the cart.1 Hour Later (Email): Send a helpful reminder with the cart contents. “Did you forget this?”24 Hours Later (Check Channel): Has the email been opened?If YES but no purchase: Send a second email with social proof (reviews).If NO open: Trigger an SMS with a short, direct link to the cart.3 Days Later (Web): When they return to the site, show a personalised pop-up offering free shipping if they complete the order today.To further optimise your omnichannel marketing automation, use A/B testing to compare different versions of your abandoned cart messages across email, SMS, and web pop-ups. By running A/B tests, you can determine which message formats, subject lines, or offers most effectively engage your audience. Measure the impact of each variation on CTR (clickthrough rate) to identify which approach drives the highest engagement and conversions. This data-driven method ensures you continually improve your workflow for maximum recovery rates.Example B: The VIP Nurture LoopFocus on customer lifetime value by treating your best buyers differently.Trigger: Customer enters the “Champion” segment (based on RFM score).Immediate Action (Email): Send a “Welcome to VIP” email with an exclusive unlocking of early access to new collections.Ongoing (Web Personalisation): Permanently change their navigation bar on the website to highlight “VIP Offers.”Special Occasion (Direct Mail/Mobile): Send a birthday wish via SMS and, if the value is high enough, trigger a notification to your team to send a handwritten note.By leveraging targeted communications throughout this workflow, you can deliver personalised messaging that increases engagement and loyalty among VIP customers.AI and the Future of AutomationThe complexity of managing these journeys across so many channels can be daunting for marketing teams. This is where Artificial Intelligence becomes your partner, not just a tool.At SALESmanago, our AI Sidekick is designed to take the heavy lifting out of omnichannel marketing automation. It moves you from “Reactive” to “Predictive.” AI also helps refine your marketing strategies by analysing key metrics from each channel, allowing you to make data-driven adjustments for greater effectiveness.Content Generation: Instead of spending hours writing copy for 10 different email variations, Generative AI can create subject lines, body copy, and even image suggestions that match your brand tone instantly.Send Time Optimisation: AI analyses individual customer behaviour to determine that User A is most likely to open emails at 8:00 AM on a Tuesday, while User B engages with SMS at 6:00 PM on a Friday. The system then automatically schedules the message for that precise moment.By automating daily tasks with AI, you achieve the best results and improve the overall effectiveness of your campaigns. By leveraging AI, you ensure that your omnichannel marketing automation strategy scales with your business. You stop being a tactician manually pulling levers and become a strategist overseeing a self-optimising engine.Conclusion: From Tactician to Growth StrategistOmnichannel marketing automation is not just about efficiency; it is about empathy at scale. It is about acknowledging that your customer is a single person, regardless of whether they are on Instagram, in their inbox, or on your mobile app. Omnichannel marketing automation is essential for the success of modern marketing teams, enabling them to deliver consistent and impactful experiences across every touchpoint.By implementing a unified marketing automation platform, you eliminate the silos that frustrate customers and leak revenue. You gain the power to deliver a superior customer experience that feels personal, timely, and relevant, achieving superior results that make the investment worth the effort.Ready to stop managing channels and start orchestrating growth?Explore the SALESmanago Growth Framework and see how your business can evolve from a Scaling Store to an eCommerce Innovator.Visual Summary We live in an attention economy. Your customers are mobile-first and distraction-prone. Omnichannel marketing is about being present on the channel that is most convenient for them, not you. For some, that is WhatsApp; for others, it is a Web Push notification. Automation allows you to route messages to the channel with the highest probability of engagement for that specific user. It can also pick the optimal time and channel to send messages, maximizing engagement through features like send time optimisation (STO).4. ConversationThe era of the “monologue”, brands talking at customers, is over. Modern customer engagement is a dialogue. Conversational marketing tools help brands engage customers in real-time across multiple channels, ensuring interactions happen at the right moments and touchpoints.This means integrating conversational marketing (Live Chat, AI Bots) into your automation flows. If a customer replies to an automation, the system must be smart enough to route that to a human agent or an AI assistant, rather than hitting a “no-reply” wall.7 Omnichannel Assets You Must ActivateTo execute this strategy, you need more than good intentions.

You need a specific set of tools working in harmony. We identify these as the 7 Strategic Assets of a comprehensive omnichannel marketing automation platform.These platforms offer key capabilities such as advanced personalisation, audience segmentation, and journey orchestration, enabling seamless and effective omnichannel campaigns. Activating all seven assets delivers significant advantages, including improved efficiency, greater flexibility, enhanced customer experience, and better decision-making for your business.1. The Central Brain (CDP)This is the heart of your operation. It is the repository where all customer data lives. Without this “Brain,” your marketing automation tools are just disparate instruments playing different songs. The Central Brain allows you to create dynamic segments, like “high spenders who haven’t visited in 30 days”, which update in real-time across all other assets. By tracking customer accounts, you can personalise engagement and segmentation based on each account's behaviours and preferences.2. The Retention Engine (Email Studio)Email remains the highest ROI channel, but only if it evolves beyond “batch-and-blast.” As a core component of omnichannel marketing automation, email marketing plays a crucial role in creating personalised campaigns that integrate data from multiple touchpoints, ensuring a consistent customer experience across all channels. Your Retention Engine must support dynamic content—blocks of the email that change based on who is opening it.Hint: A single email campaign sent to 100,000 people should look like 100,000 different emails, with product recommendations tailored specifically to each user’s browsing history.3. The Mobile Bridge (SMS & Mobile Push)Mobile channels are your bridge to immediate action. Integrating various channels like SMS, mobile push, and in-app notifications enhances the immediacy and reach of marketing campaigns. With open rates often exceeding 90%, SMS is a powerful asset for time-sensitive marketing campaigns.Hint: Use mobile for “Flash Sales” or urgent “Back in Stock” notifications where speed is the primary value driver.4. The On-site Concierge (Website Personalisation)Your website should not be a static brochure; it should be a living environment. This asset uses marketing automation to change the website interface based on the visitor.Hint: If a visitor is browsing "Winter Jackets," the homepage banner should automatically switch to feature your best-selling parkas, and a pop-up should offer a "Winter Guide" in exchange for their email address.5. The Conversation Hub (Contact Centre & Chat)Following our acquisitions of Leadoo and Thulium, SALESmanago emphasises that support is marketing. The Conversation Hub connects your service team to the automation data.Hint: When a VIP customer initiates a chat, the agent immediately sees their customer lifetime value and recent purchases, allowing them to offer a personalised upsell or a “thank you” gift. Personalised support in the Conversation Hub leads to higher customer satisfaction.6. The Ad ConnectorYour omnichannel marketing strategy must extend beyond your own properties. The Ad Connector syncs your CDP segments with ad platforms like Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and Google Ads.Hint: You can automatically stop showing ads to customers who have already purchased the product. This saves budget and reduces advertising cost by targeting only relevant audiences, directly improving the customer experience.7. The Prediction Layer (AI)Finally, the modern growth stack requires intelligence. The Prediction Layer uses AI to look forward, not just backward. It predicts customer behaviour, such as the likelihood of churn or the probability of purchase, allowing you to trigger automations before the customer even acts. AI can also help identify the potential of customers, enabling targeted outreach to those most likely to engage and convert.Build Your Omnichannel Marketing Automation StrategyNow that you understand the assets, how do you build the structure? To implement an effective omnichannel marketing automation strategy, you need to follow a series of steps that coordinate your efforts across multiple channels for maximum impact. A successful strategy is built in three phases.Step 1: Map the Connected Customer JourneyStop thinking in linear funnels. The modern customer journey is a loop. Map out the key touchpoints where value can be added and engage customers across different channels:Discovery: social media, organic search.Interest: website browsing, newsletter signup.Consideration: cart addition, price comparison.Purchase: transaction, delivery tracking.Retention: support, feedback, repurchase.You must ensure the customer journey can continue seamlessly as customers move between different channels. Identify where the friction points are. Where are people dropping off? That is where omnichannel marketing automation must be deployed.Step 2: Unify and Segment Your DataBefore building workflows, define your logic. We recommend using RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) as a starting point.Champions: Buy often, spend a lot, bought recently.Loyal Customers: Buy regularly.Hibernating: Used to buy, but haven't in a while.Each of these groups requires a completely different omnichannel marketing approach.Step 3: Orchestrate the "Money Maker" WorkflowsDon’t try to automate everything at once. Start with the high-impact marketing campaigns that drive immediate revenue. Automation streamlines tasks that would otherwise require a manual process, allowing you to efficiently manage activities across multiple channels. Here are examples of omnichannel marketing workflows you can build today:Example A: The Omnichannel Abandoned CartInstead of a simple email, use a cascading workflow to maximise recovery rates.Trigger: Customer leaves items in the cart.1 Hour Later (Email): Send a helpful reminder with the cart contents. “Did you forget this?”24 Hours Later (Check Channel): Has the email been opened?If YES but no purchase: Send a second email with social proof (reviews).If NO open: Trigger an SMS with a short, direct link to the cart.3 Days Later (Web): When they return to the site, show a personalised pop-up offering free shipping if they complete the order today.To further optimise your omnichannel marketing automation, use A/B testing to compare different versions of your abandoned cart messages across email, SMS, and web pop-ups. By running A/B tests, you can determine which message formats, subject lines, or offers most effectively engage your audience. Measure the impact of each variation on CTR (clickthrough rate) to identify which approach drives the highest engagement and conversions. This data-driven method ensures you continually improve your workflow for maximum recovery rates.Example B: The VIP Nurture LoopFocus on customer lifetime value by treating your best buyers differently.Trigger: Customer enters the “Champion” segment (based on RFM score).Immediate Action (Email): Send a “Welcome to VIP” email with an exclusive unlocking of early access to new collections.Ongoing (Web Personalisation): Permanently change their navigation bar on the website to highlight “VIP Offers.”Special Occasion (Direct Mail/Mobile): Send a birthday wish via SMS and, if the value is high enough, trigger a notification to your team to send a handwritten note.By leveraging targeted communications throughout this workflow, you can deliver personalised messaging that increases engagement and loyalty among VIP customers.AI and the Future of AutomationThe complexity of managing these journeys across so many channels can be daunting for marketing teams. This is where Artificial Intelligence becomes your partner, not just a tool.At SALESmanago, our AI Sidekick is designed to take the heavy lifting out of omnichannel marketing automation. It moves you from “Reactive” to “Predictive.” AI also helps refine your marketing strategies by analysing key metrics from each channel, allowing you to make data-driven adjustments for greater effectiveness.Content Generation: Instead of spending hours writing copy for 10 different email variations, Generative AI can create subject lines, body copy, and even image suggestions that match your brand tone instantly.Send Time Optimisation: AI analyses individual customer behaviour to determine that User A is most likely to open emails at 8:00 AM on a Tuesday, while User B engages with SMS at 6:00 PM on a Friday. The system then automatically schedules the message for that precise moment.By automating daily tasks with AI, you achieve the best results and improve the overall effectiveness of your campaigns.

The Ad Connector syncs your CDP segments with ad platforms like Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and Google Ads.Hint: You can automatically stop showing ads to customers who have already purchased the product. This saves budget and reduces advertising cost by targeting only relevant audiences, directly improving the customer experience.7. The Prediction Layer (AI)Finally, the modern growth stack requires intelligence. The Prediction Layer uses AI to look forward, not just backward. It predicts customer behaviour, such as the likelihood of churn or the probability of purchase, allowing you to trigger automations before the customer even acts. AI can also help identify the potential of customers, enabling targeted outreach to those most likely to engage and convert.Build Your Omnichannel Marketing Automation StrategyNow that you understand the assets, how do you build the structure? To implement an effective omnichannel marketing automation strategy, you need to follow a series of steps that coordinate your efforts across multiple channels for maximum impact. A successful strategy is built in three phases.Step 1: Map the Connected Customer JourneyStop thinking in linear funnels. The modern customer journey is a loop. Map out the key touchpoints where value can be added and engage customers across different channels:Discovery: social media, organic search.Interest: website browsing, newsletter signup.Consideration: cart addition, price comparison.Purchase: transaction, delivery tracking.Retention: support, feedback, repurchase.You must ensure the customer journey can continue seamlessly as customers move between different channels. Identify where the friction points are. Where are people dropping off? That is where omnichannel marketing automation must be deployed.Step 2: Unify and Segment Your DataBefore building workflows, define your logic. We recommend using RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) as a starting point.Champions: Buy often, spend a lot, bought recently.Loyal Customers: Buy regularly.Hibernating: Used to buy, but haven't in a while.Each of these groups requires a completely different omnichannel marketing approach.Step 3: Orchestrate the "Money Maker" WorkflowsDon’t try to automate everything at once. Start with the high-impact marketing campaigns that drive immediate revenue. Automation streamlines tasks that would otherwise require a manual process, allowing you to efficiently manage activities across multiple channels. Here are examples of omnichannel marketing workflows you can build today:Example A: The Omnichannel Abandoned CartInstead of a simple email, use a cascading workflow to maximise recovery rates.Trigger: Customer leaves items in the cart.1 Hour Later (Email): Send a helpful reminder with the cart contents. “Did you forget this?”24 Hours Later (Check Channel): Has the email been opened?If YES but no purchase: Send a second email with social proof (reviews).If NO open: Trigger an SMS with a short, direct link to the cart.3 Days Later (Web): When they return to the site, show a personalised pop-up offering free shipping if they complete the order today.To further optimise your omnichannel marketing automation, use A/B testing to compare different versions of your abandoned cart messages across email, SMS, and web pop-ups. By running A/B tests, you can determine which message formats, subject lines, or offers most effectively engage your audience. Measure the impact of each variation on CTR (clickthrough rate) to identify which approach drives the highest engagement and conversions. This data-driven method ensures you continually improve your workflow for maximum recovery rates.Example B: The VIP Nurture LoopFocus on customer lifetime value by treating your best buyers differently.Trigger: Customer enters the “Champion” segment (based on RFM score).Immediate Action (Email): Send a “Welcome to VIP” email with an exclusive unlocking of early access to new collections.Ongoing (Web Personalisation): Permanently change their navigation bar on the website to highlight “VIP Offers.”Special Occasion (Direct Mail/Mobile): Send a birthday wish via SMS and, if the value is high enough, trigger a notification to your team to send a handwritten note.By leveraging targeted communications throughout this workflow, you can deliver personalised messaging that increases engagement and loyalty among VIP customers.AI and the Future of AutomationThe complexity of managing these journeys across so many channels can be daunting for marketing teams. This is where Artificial Intelligence becomes your partner, not just a tool.At SALESmanago, our AI Sidekick is designed to take the heavy lifting out of omnichannel marketing automation. It moves you from “Reactive” to “Predictive.” AI also helps refine your marketing strategies by analysing key metrics from each channel, allowing you to make data-driven adjustments for greater effectiveness.Content Generation: Instead of spending hours writing copy for 10 different email variations, Generative AI can create subject lines, body copy, and even image suggestions that match your brand tone instantly.Send Time Optimisation: AI analyses individual customer behaviour to determine that User A is most likely to open emails at 8:00 AM on a Tuesday, while User B engages with SMS at 6:00 PM on a Friday. The system then automatically schedules the message for that precise moment.By automating daily tasks with AI, you achieve the best results and improve the overall effectiveness of your campaigns. By leveraging AI, you ensure that your omnichannel marketing automation strategy scales with your business. You stop being a tactician manually pulling levers and become a strategist overseeing a self-optimising engine.Conclusion: From Tactician to Growth StrategistOmnichannel marketing automation is not just about efficiency; it is about empathy at scale.

Integrating various channels like SMS, mobile push, and in-app notifications enhances the immediacy and reach of marketing campaigns. With open rates often exceeding 90%, SMS is a powerful asset for time-sensitive marketing campaigns.Hint: Use mobile for “Flash Sales” or urgent “Back in Stock” notifications where speed is the primary value driver.4. The On-site Concierge (Website Personalisation)Your website should not be a static brochure; it should be a living environment. This asset uses marketing automation to change the website interface based on the visitor.Hint: If a visitor is browsing "Winter Jackets," the homepage banner should automatically switch to feature your best-selling parkas, and a pop-up should offer a "Winter Guide" in exchange for their email address.5.

Start with the high-impact marketing campaigns that drive immediate revenue. Automation streamlines tasks that would otherwise require a manual process, allowing you to efficiently manage activities across multiple channels. Here are examples of omnichannel marketing workflows you can build today:Example A: The Omnichannel Abandoned CartInstead of a simple email, use a cascading workflow to maximise recovery rates.Trigger: Customer leaves items in the cart.1 Hour Later (Email): Send a helpful reminder with the cart contents. “Did you forget this?”24 Hours Later (Check Channel): Has the email been opened?If YES but no purchase: Send a second email with social proof (reviews).If NO open: Trigger an SMS with a short, direct link to the cart.3 Days Later (Web): When they return to the site, show a personalised pop-up offering free shipping if they complete the order today.To further optimise your omnichannel marketing automation, use A/B testing to compare different versions of your abandoned cart messages across email, SMS, and web pop-ups. By running A/B tests, you can determine which message formats, subject lines, or offers most effectively engage your audience. Measure the impact of each variation on CTR (clickthrough rate) to identify which approach drives the highest engagement and conversions. This data-driven method ensures you continually improve your workflow for maximum recovery rates.Example B: The VIP Nurture LoopFocus on customer lifetime value by treating your best buyers differently.Trigger: Customer enters the “Champion” segment (based on RFM score).Immediate Action (Email): Send a “Welcome to VIP” email with an exclusive unlocking of early access to new collections.Ongoing (Web Personalisation): Permanently change their navigation bar on the website to highlight “VIP Offers.”Special Occasion (Direct Mail/Mobile): Send a birthday wish via SMS and, if the value is high enough, trigger a notification to your team to send a handwritten note.By leveraging targeted communications throughout this workflow, you can deliver personalised messaging that increases engagement and loyalty among VIP customers.AI and the Future of AutomationThe complexity of managing these journeys across so many channels can be daunting for marketing teams. This is where Artificial Intelligence becomes your partner, not just a tool.At SALESmanago, our AI Sidekick is designed to take the heavy lifting out of omnichannel marketing automation. It moves you from “Reactive” to “Predictive.” AI also helps refine your marketing strategies by analysing key metrics from each channel, allowing you to make data-driven adjustments for greater effectiveness.Content Generation: Instead of spending hours writing copy for 10 different email variations, Generative AI can create subject lines, body copy, and even image suggestions that match your brand tone instantly.Send Time Optimisation: AI analyses individual customer behaviour to determine that User A is most likely to open emails at 8:00 AM on a Tuesday, while User B engages with SMS at 6:00 PM on a Friday. The system then automatically schedules the message for that precise moment.By automating daily tasks with AI, you achieve the best results and improve the overall effectiveness of your campaigns. By leveraging AI, you ensure that your omnichannel marketing automation strategy scales with your business. You stop being a tactician manually pulling levers and become a strategist overseeing a self-optimising engine.Conclusion: From Tactician to Growth StrategistOmnichannel marketing automation is not just about efficiency; it is about empathy at scale. It is about acknowledging that your customer is a single person, regardless of whether they are on Instagram, in their inbox, or on your mobile app. Omnichannel marketing automation is essential for the success of modern marketing teams, enabling them to deliver consistent and impactful experiences across every touchpoint.By implementing a unified marketing automation platform, you eliminate the silos that frustrate customers and leak revenue.

Personalised support in the Conversation Hub leads to higher customer satisfaction.6. The Ad ConnectorYour omnichannel marketing strategy must extend beyond your own properties. The Ad Connector syncs your CDP segments with ad platforms like Meta (Facebook/Instagram) and Google Ads.Hint: You can automatically stop showing ads to customers who have already purchased the product. This saves budget and reduces advertising cost by targeting only relevant audiences, directly improving the customer experience.7. The Prediction Layer (AI)Finally, the modern growth stack requires intelligence. The Prediction Layer uses AI to look forward, not just backward. It predicts customer behaviour, such as the likelihood of churn or the probability of purchase, allowing you to trigger automations before the customer even acts. AI can also help identify the potential of customers, enabling targeted outreach to those most likely to engage and convert.Build Your Omnichannel Marketing Automation StrategyNow that you understand the assets, how do you build the structure? To implement an effective omnichannel marketing automation strategy, you need to follow a series of steps that coordinate your efforts across multiple channels for maximum impact. A successful strategy is built in three phases.Step 1: Map the Connected Customer JourneyStop thinking in linear funnels. The modern customer journey is a loop. Map out the key touchpoints where value can be added and engage customers across different channels:Discovery: social media, organic search.Interest: website browsing, newsletter signup.Consideration: cart addition, price comparison.Purchase: transaction, delivery tracking.Retention: support, feedback, repurchase.You must ensure the customer journey can continue seamlessly as customers move between different channels. Identify where the friction points are. Where are people dropping off?

You must ensure the customer journey can continue seamlessly as customers move between different channels. Identify where the friction points are. Where are people dropping off? That is where omnichannel marketing automation must be deployed.Step 2: Unify and Segment Your DataBefore building workflows, define your logic. We recommend using RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) as a starting point.Champions: Buy often, spend a lot, bought recently.Loyal Customers: Buy regularly.Hibernating: Used to buy, but haven't in a while.Each of these groups requires a completely different omnichannel marketing approach.Step 3: Orchestrate the "Money Maker" WorkflowsDon’t try to automate everything at once. Start with the high-impact marketing campaigns that drive immediate revenue. Automation streamlines tasks that would otherwise require a manual process, allowing you to efficiently manage activities across multiple channels. Here are examples of omnichannel marketing workflows you can build today:Example A: The Omnichannel Abandoned CartInstead of a simple email, use a cascading workflow to maximise recovery rates.Trigger: Customer leaves items in the cart.1 Hour Later (Email): Send a helpful reminder with the cart contents. “Did you forget this?”24 Hours Later (Check Channel): Has the email been opened?If YES but no purchase: Send a second email with social proof (reviews).If NO open: Trigger an SMS with a short, direct link to the cart.3 Days Later (Web): When they return to the site, show a personalised pop-up offering free shipping if they complete the order today.To further optimise your omnichannel marketing automation, use A/B testing to compare different versions of your abandoned cart messages across email, SMS, and web pop-ups. By running A/B tests, you can determine which message formats, subject lines, or offers most effectively engage your audience.

Title: Affordability, AI Stocks, Parlays and Bad Bunny Top Investopedia’s Terms of the Year
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/the-2025-investopedia-terms-of-the-year-11868069
Time Published: 2025-12-12T22:14:31Z
Full Content:
Some weeks last a year, and some years feel like they last a decade. 2025 has brought us ten years' worth of news that has reshaped the global economy and financial markets at a breakneck pace. A tariff war, the AI of everything and the stocks tied to it, the proliferation of sports betting and the prediction markets, the entrance of cryptocurrencies into our federal banking system, and a relentless bull market were just some of this year’s headlines. Investopedia’s ever-curious readers stayed on top of all of these market-moving events as they circulated through our articles and financial terms that helped define these dynamics. Some events drew more interest and attention from our readers than others, demonstrating what was truly on the minds of educated investors in 2025. Here are Investopedia’s top terms of this year: Investopedia Investopedia No other word has captured the attention of our readers and most consumers this year. Inflation, although lower than the 2022 highs, remained persistent throughout the year and was amplified by the White House's aggressive tariff policies. Food prices, health care, and home prices remained persistently high, pushing consumer sentiment to lows not seen since the Great Financial Crisis. More Americans felt priced out of the so-called “American Dream," with the lack of home affordability among their top concerns. While some political leaders called the use of the word ‘affordability’ a ‘hoax’, many Americans who feel trapped in the bottom leg of the K-shaped economy felt its real effects in mounting debt and lack of savings. Tariffs dominated the headlines in 2025 and for the better part of 2024, making it our top term last year. Still, 2025 was shaped more by the impacts, or concerns about the impacts of tariffs on issues such as affordability (see above). That said, investors, consumers, and business owners needed a calculator and a good eraser to try to quantify the impact of tariffs on the real cost of goods, given how many times they were imposed, reduced, or reciprocated by the White House in 2025. There is no doubt that tariffs have become one of the key instruments of economic policy in the 2020s, and we should expect this term to remain popular. Among all the major asset classes in 2025, none shone brighter than gold. The precious metal surged more than 60% year-to-date, as investors, from global central banks to retail investors shopping at Costco on a Sunday, clung to it as the safe-haven asset it is known to be. Even as the stock market and Bitcoin steadily rose throughout most of the year, gold’s allure was too strong for those investors looking for a buoy to cling to in the tumultuous seas of tariffs and stock market uncertainty. Record gold prices spilled over into other metals, such as silver, which also hit record-high prices throughout the year. 2025 may be remembered as the beginning of the super-scaling of the Artificial Intelligence ecosystem and infrastructure, and the stocks that took off with it. While companies like Nvidia (NVDA), have been benefitting from the build-out of AI for several years, 2025 was the year we saw companies like Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), and Alphabet (GOOGL) blow out their CapEx budgets to the tune of $380 billion, and pledging to spend even more over the next several years. The more they spent, the more their stock prices climbed, until, that is, the last quarter of 2025, when investors and executives began questioning whether these AI stocks are in a bubble. According to Investopedia's most recent sentiment survey, our readers agree. The Trump administration came into office pledging to make America the ‘Crypto Capital of the World’. It began that process by passing the Stablecoin Act of 2025, also known as the Genius Act. That established the first federal framework for payment Stablecoins in the U.S. Our readers wanted to understand what a Stablecoin actually is, how it compares to Bitcoin, and why our federal government wants to introduce a digital asset pegged to the U.S. dollar into our banking system. 2025 will also be remembered as the year that sports betting, event betting, and predictive markets went mainstream. Americans are expected to wager over $150 billion in 2025, and with more states legalizing sports betting, bet on that number to grow. As it does, our readers wanted to learn more about the high-risk, high-reward parlay bet, which links together two or more individual bets, known as legs, but only pays out if every leg wins. While there weren’t any major convictions or charges of insider trading in 2025, our readers were searching for what it actually means and whether it was happening in front of us on several occasions this year. This term received extra attention in early April following the so-called “Liberation Day,” as the U.S. imposed reciprocal tariffs on hundreds of trading partners, leading to a near 5% selloff in the S&P 500. As the stock market went on to fall as much as 19% in the subsequent days, the President’s post telling Americans to “Buy Stocks” just before he lifted or paused many of those tariffs on April 9th raised more than a few eyebrows, especially as the market roared back to record highs. Reports of government officials selling stocks before Liberation Day surfaced soon after, but charges were never filed. While technically not a financial term, Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio, better known as ‘Bad Bunny,’ got as much attention for his business acumen and net worth as he did for his latest best-selling album. 2025 was a good year for Bad Bunny’s money, as he was Spotify’s most-streamed artist, sold out arenas around the world, including a residency in his home country of Puerto Rico, hosted SNL, and was selected to be the headline act at the Super Bowl in 2026. His net worth, according to our latest report, is $88 million, and climbing. Kevin Winter / Getty Images The private markets, which include private capital and private equity, were once an exclusive playground for institutional and well-heeled accredited investors. Inherently opaque, often risky, but tempting with upside potential, private markets have received a public reception from the new administration, which is lowering regulatory hurdles to allow them into defined contribution plans, such as 401(k)s and IRAs. In August, President Trump signed an executive order to ‘democratize’ access to alternative investments, such as private markets, paving the way for their inclusion in retirement plans. Our readers sought to learn everything they could about private markets and their potential impact on their portfolios. One of the simplest strategies to generate income in the stock market this year was through covered calls in the options market. The strategy involves an investor who owns a stock with no intention of selling it, does not expect the price to move significantly, and sells a call option that generates a premium for the option's term. If the stock rises in price, the investor gets their premium payment plus the increase in the stock price, up to the strike price. If the stock falls, the investor still gets the premium, which offsets some of the loss. As the stock market has been churning sideways since September, more of our readers have wanted to learn and use this strategy.

Title: Replacing The Woo Products Module With Custom Loops In Divi 5

Posted on December 12, 2025 by Christopher Morris 1 Comment The WooCommerce Products Module is Divi’s built-in solution for displaying products. It automatically connects to your shop and provides quick toggles for product images, titles, prices, ratings, and add-to-cart buttons. Divi 5‘s new Loop Builder takes a fundamentally different approach to building product features. You design the product card with any modules you choose, and then dynamically feed WooCommerce data into it. Both tools display product listings, yet each excels in different scenarios. You can use either, but the Loop Builder offers far more flexibility, which could help you build a better online store. Let’s compare the two. The WooCommerce Products Module is built for standard ecommerce patterns. It assumes you want recognizable product cards and lets you toggle what shows, keeping setup fast and decisions simple. Think about how WooCommerce products work. Every product shares certain common elements that make it recognizable as ecommerce content. These shared characteristics include: The Products Module was designed with these traditional elements in mind. Images show what you’re selling. Titles identify the product. Prices tell customers what it costs. The add-to-cart button completes the sale. Divi’s Products Module syncs to these elements automatically. You drop it on the page and pick what to show. The feed appears with no custom query work at all (unless you want to limit what’s being shown, in which case there are built-in filtering tools). The toggle approach makes changes painless. You can hide the rating but keep the price, show sale badges, or skip the description. Small decisions and quick results. The Products Module can display WooCommerce products along with filtering options for product types (like featured products). The Products Module works great when you stick to WooCommerce’s standard data structure. It limits its options to fields that are native to WooCommerce’s default product data. Detailed specifications, custom badges, shipping estimates, or anything custom won’t appear in the Products Module because it was built for standard WooCommerce fields. The module has no toggle for those custom product details. Layout control is also slightly constrained; the module uses a fixed grid structure, allowing you to set the number of grid columns. However, it does not include Divi’s newest Grid and Flex CSS layout controls. Divi’s Loop Builder offers you a different approach to displaying WooCommerce products. Instead of working within the constraints of a single module with predetermined elements, the Loop Builder allows you to construct your product display from individual Divi Modules arranged exactly as you envision them. Using the Loop Builder requires more thought and preparation, but you won’t be limited in the ways you were with the Products Module. With the Products Module, you work within existing constraints and make the best of predetermined options. With the Loop Builder, you start with a blank canvas and construct exactly what you need using any combination of Divi Modules. This is a short set of terms for beginners who are new to working with custom product displays: If you get lost in some of the details, refer back to this glossary. But we’ll make things simple for you along the way. The loop Builder is not a single module. It is a container with your chosen modules inside it. When the container is set to “Loop” with a query type of “Products,” it repeats itself for each matching product. Inside the container, you can place Image, Heading, Text, Button, and any other Divi modules. Can also be used in the Theme Builder set to “Posts for Current Page” You bind the content of each of those modules to the correct WooCommerce data token. Divi’s UI makes this straightforward. The Image points to the product image. The Heading points to the product title. The Text Module can show the price. The Button links to the add-to-cart action or product page. This modular approach gives you complete structure and spacing control. You can put images above or beside titles. You can add multiple text blocks for price, SKU, and custom fields. You can create unique badge designs or custom rating displays. This way, you build the product card you need, not a card that is pre-configured via a module. Let’s make this concrete with a quick scenario. We’ll quickly build a similar product card (compared with the example Products Module above) and swap the data sources to show the Loop Builder’s flexibility. And apply some styles that will be used with each post item in the loop. Then, build a custom Loop for standard WooCommerce products. Use the “Product” post type. We will also use four post items in this loop. Now, we’ll quickly assign some basic dynamic content to the sub-modules of this Loop. We’ll start with Product Featured Image, Product Title, and Product Price. Now, if you have custom fields with data applied through a WooCommerce extension, you can apply those via Custom Field assignments inside the Dynamic Content selector. I also went ahead and added an icon and changed up the flex settings to arrange the items better. And this is the end result. A clean-looking card for a product category page through the Theme Builder. It utilizes a custom field and simple filtering, making the Loop Builder ideal for this purpose. How do you add those custom fields to WooCommerce products? Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) is the go-to choice here, while Pods, Meta Box, ACPT, and Toolset can also do the job. Numerous WooCommerce extensions offer this functionality specifically for WooCommerce. This is less about raw features and more about finding the right fit. Pick the fastest path that meets the requirement. Switch tools when the need changes. Sometimes the Products Module will do the trick, but you have a strong pivot with the Loop Builder when it doesn’t. Reach for the Products Module when the card you want to design includes only standard WooCommerce fields. Straightforward product catalogs that link out to individual product pages. The Products Module also has slightly better filtering options, so you can showcase featured products or those on sale. Use the Loop Builder when you need custom fields that standard WooCommerce products don’t include, or when your product card design doesn’t match a stock pattern. The trade-off is that you’ll need to work around the missing WooCommerce-specific filters by using categories, tags, or custom fields instead. Divi’s Products Module is still the fastest way to display a standard WooCommerce product grid, and it remains the only option for WooCommerce-specific filters, such as featured products, sale items, best-sellers, and sorting by price or popularity. The Loop Builder unlocks custom product cards, custom fields, unique layouts, and complete design control. The Loop Builder can also be customized and molded into the exact layout and design you have in mind, whereas the Products Module has some limitations. The best part about this decision is that you can keep both in your toolkit and choose based on the particular section you are creating.

Title: AI is powering Trump’s economy, but American voters are getting worried

President Donald Trump is heading into the 2026 election year vowing to pull out all the stops to promote artificial intelligence — just as American voters are starting to voice some doubts. All through Trump’s first year back in office, almost everyone had something to say about AI. Economists detailed how it’s powering US growth. White House aides explained why it’s key to staying ahead of China. Stock-watchers cheered a market boom, and fretted about a bubble. Tech geeks speculated about what the bots might one day be able to do. The president helped fuel the buzz, appearing alongside various tycoons to announce big AI projects. On Thursday, he signed an order seeking to limit states from imposing their own curbs on AI — marking another win for the industry. “Our administration is committed to total dominance in technology,” he said a day before at a White House event with prominent tech executives. “Right now, we’re leading artificial intelligence by a lot.” One group that hasn’t gotten much of a hearing above the hubbub is the US electorate. But in last month’s off-year contests there were signs of an AI backlash, one that could amplify concerns about the cost of living and the job-market outlook in Trump’s economy. At the local level, many voters objected to the spread of data centers, the building blocks of AI’s advance, whose huge demand for electricity is getting linked to bigger household bills. That affordability issue now has political traction. It helped Democrats score major wins in Virginia and New Jersey. On top of that, there’s the employment risk. Data centers create plenty of construction jobs but not so many once they’re up and running. Worse, there are widespread fears that the technologies incubated there may turn out to be job-killers. None of this means AI isn’t key to America’s economic future — just that it’s hard to sell as a political priority in the meantime. That’s particularly true for a White House already struggling to convince voters that Trump’s economic policies are working. Perhaps there’s an echo of the debate over free trade. Economists, executives and investors all predicted long-run benefits, but millions of American voters reckoned they’d drawn a short straw, and the disruption helped bring Trump to power. Now Steve Bannon, one of the populist MAGA movement’s architects, has all but declared war on AI, citing economic, political and even religious reasons to rein it in. “They are coming at you from every different direction. They want your productivity until they get the robots and then they’ll toss you aside like trash,” the former Trump strategist said on his “Bannon’s War Room” podcast, in a November episode devoted to the dangers of AI. The White House has pointed to potential productivity gains from AI as enriching workers and businesses. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett — seen as the frontrunner to be Trump’s next Federal Reserve chair — in a recent Fox Business interview said AI would “make a lot of productive workers a heck of a lot of money.” AI technology will aid, not replace, American workers, according to a White House official who requested anonymity to detail their thinking. Ensuring the US is a leader in AI will help create more employment opportunities and also lower costs for services and goods, further spurring job growth, according to the official. The Department of Labor said it was investing in skills training to help workers benefit from AI and to help fill surging demand for jobs to build out the technology’s infrastructure. Still, there’s anxiety at the grassroots level — and it’s not only politicians who’ll have to factor that in. There’s been a surge this year in the number of data center plans blocked or delayed by local opposition, according to Data Center Watch, a monitor run by AI intelligence company 10a Labs. Its research identifies $98 billion of investments stymied in the second quarter, more than the total for all previous quarters since 2023. That’s adding time, uncertainty and political risk to some projects, which investors will likely start to price in, said Miquel Vila, an analyst at the group. Lordstown in northeast Ohio illustrates the gap between the upbeat talk from the top and anxiety on the ground. It’s one of five locations where AI infrastructure is being developed as part of Stargate, a $500 billion project announced by Trump in January on his first full day back in the White House. But not far away, another company backing a separate $3.6 billion data center project is finding that many residents don’t want it — even though the region could use an economic lift, after losing 40% of its manufacturing jobs in the past two decades. Bristolville 25 Developer LLC wants to build a data center campus on 133 acres of industrially zoned property. The village council is trying to block large-scale data centers because of concerns like rising power costs, water usage and pollution, and Lordstown Mayor Jackie Woodward said four council elections last month hinged on whether candidates opposed such projects. “I don’t have the money to pay a bigger electric bill or bigger water bill,” Richard Coe, a 78-year-old Lordstown retiree, told the council at a Nov. 3 meeting. “So I would appreciate that our council members take that into account.” In letters to village officials, attorneys for Bristolville outlined benefits that the investment would bring, including more than a million dollars a year in state and local income tax revenue, plus millions in property taxes. Bristolville has also offered $10.8 million for water infrastructure upgrades, as well as contributions to a community fund for facilities like an event center or pickleball court. The venture would employ an estimated 1,600 workers during peak construction, and then 120 full-time employees with an average wage of more than $84 per hour. That’s not enough permanent jobs to justify the impact on the community, said Lordstown Council President Robert Bond. “We don’t see the advantage tying up large industrial acreage for 120 jobs.” Among leading Republicans, it’s state governors who are most worried about an AI backlash, according to one Trump adviser who says the party wants to “win the AI race” but hasn’t really figured out what that means. Concerns at this stage are more focused on electricity bills, which threaten to become a benchmark affordability measure like gas-pump prices have traditionally been, than the risk to white-collar jobs. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, who earlier this year intervened to preserve an exemption from state sales taxes for data centers, isn’t among the doubters. He says rising electricity prices are “a legitimate discussion,” but doesn’t think local opposition will stunt the industry in Ohio. “We believe that data centers bring other business, that they bring other jobs into the state,” DeWine says. Back in Washington, the Trump administration seems chiefly interested in ensuring AI companies keep expanding — since that’s what is powering the economy and equity markets. Trump this week granted permission to Nvidia Corp. to export its high-end H200 chip to China, bypassing national security concerns that had previously loomed large. Many analysts calculate that the AI boom accounted for more than half of US GDP growth in the first six months of 2025, and see that trend continuing when third-quarter numbers come out. The big tech companies, including Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Meta Platforms Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Oracle Corp. — have tripled their capital spending, which will likely exceed $500 billion in 2026 according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. Many of these companies donated to Trump’s presidential inauguration, or his new White House ballroom, or both. There’s consensus on Wall Street that AI has driven most of the gains on the S&P 500this year — but disagreement over whether that’s pushed the market into bubble territory. Lenders who funneled cash into the data-center rollout have begun to seek hedges. Oaktree Capital Management LP’s Howard Marks plunged into the debate this week, calling the AI risk to employment “terrifying.” Economists are scouring the data — which is patchy, thanks to the long government shutdown – for early signs of where the AI economy is ultimately headed, for better or worse. That could show up as faster productivity growth, or AI-driven job cuts, or strains on the electrical system, though it’s likely too soon to be sure. In both political parties there’s a sense that more thought-out AI strategies will be needed – but neither of them has one right now, according to another Trump adviser, who calls AI a “political football.” Leading Democrats like Virginia Senator Mark Warner and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg have cited the need for lawmakers to respond faster to the pace of change without offering much in the way of policy proposals. Democratic candidates who won governorship contests in Virginia and New Jersey promised steps to shield households from higher power prices driven by data centers. In the coming weeks, the White House is expected to release a much-anticipated executive order on expanding the US electric grid. It will include measures focused on bolstering transmission capacity and enhancing grid technology, according to a person who’s been briefed on drafts. Politically the message is far simpler: The administration is trying to show it’s doing all it can to boost power output in the hope of bringing down prices. And it’s redoubled the effort after Democratic ballot wins in November, amid expectations that data centers will consume more energy and keep pushing electricity prices up. Gene Sperling, a former National Economic Council director and adviser to former President Joe Biden, sees a similarity with the 2024 election campaign. Biden and then his deputy, Kamala Harris, campaigned hard on the big-money investments in electric cars and clean energy their policies had delivered. But voter anxieties about the cost of living helped swing the election to Trump. There might be a lesson there on AI for Republicans heading into 2026, Sperling told Bloomberg TV. “You would let people know, ‘Hey, we want to lead in AI, we want to beat China,’” he said. “But we also want to do it in a way that you’re not seeing people make hundreds of millions of dollars while your electricity costs are going up.”

Broadcom shares fell nearly 5% after earnings despite strong AI-driven revenue. Investors reacted to lower expected margins from AI systems and sky-high expectations. Oracle’s weak outlook added pressure, but analysts say Broadcom’s $73B backlog and soaring custom-chip demand still support multi-quarter AI growth.

Business An exterior view of the Oracle Field Office at Wilson Boulevard in Arlington, Virginia, U.S., October 18, 2019. REUTERS/Tom Brenner/File Photo NEW YORK, Dec 12 : The red-hot trade backing artificial intelligence-related stocks has taken a bruising from back-to-back troubling updates from Oracle and Broadcom, reigniting concerns about frothy valuations and an AI bubble. Still, investors say reasons for optimism about AI remain intact, and many are wary about calling a top. Investors have piled into AI-related companies this year as the technology has taken off, with promises to make Corporate America more efficient. But some investors feel AI-related shares are overvalued. High-profile names such as Michael Burry have been bearish, comparing the recent AI boom to the 1990s dot-com era. For now, however, short-selling has been limited to smaller companies, with few pressing bearish bets against the biggest AI names.

Title: Tech stocks tumble amid renewed AI worries on Wall Street

news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time As tech companies push the stock market to record highs, fears of an artificial intelligence bubble continue to simmer on Wall Street, where even a slight earnings miss threatens to upend high-flying stocks. On Thursday, Oracle was the latest company to experience that firsthand. Oracle shares closed down nearly 11% on Thursday after the company announced revenue that fell short of Wall Street estimates. That wiped nearly $70 billion off the company's market value in a matter of hours. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was the only major index to close lower, because of tremors in the market made by Oracle. The S&P 500 ended the day at a record high, as did the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average. Oracle also announced Wednesday night that its spending for fiscal 2026 would be $15 billion more than its estimate in September. The company's total capital expenditures for fiscal year 2026 are set to be $50 billion. Many of those expenses will be driven by contracts with the likes of Meta and Nvidia, Oracle said. It also said it had a backlog of signed contracts with customers worth $523 billion. Long known for dull back-office software systems, Oracle this year found a renewed purpose as a provider of cloud computing services for the AI boom. But Oracle's share-price drop Thursday had a ripple effect on other top AI stocks for most of the day. Nvidia shares dropped almost 1.5%, while chipmakers Arm Holdings and Intel slid more than 3%. Google owner Alphabet dropped 2.4%. Data center operator CoreWeave and other chipmakers, like AMD and Micron, also dipped into the red. As Oracle's spending rises on the back of AI deals — which some consider "circular" — the company's credit default swaps have soared. The swaps, or CDSes, can be a proxy to gauge how risky a company's bonds or debt are. After Oracle's earnings report Wednesday, they soared to the highest level since 2009, according to Bloomberg, which cited data from the exchange operator ICE. Oracle's credit default swaps have become a closely tracked measure among investors and a barometer for the state of the AI industry overall. On Wednesday night's call, Oracle's principal financial officer, Doug Kehring, said the company is "committed to maintaining our investment-grade debt rating." "Investment grade" is a rating given to a company's bonds or credit on a sliding scale. Anything below investment-grade is considered speculative, also often referred to as junk. Earlier Thursday, Oracle declined as much as 16.5%, which would have put it on track for its worst one-day performance since 2001. With the S&P 500 up more than 16% and the Nasdaq Composite up more than 20% for the year, the market broadly remains in good shape. Still, the nature and the size of the AI deals — and their uncertain returns — are leading some to question whether the investment boom portends an upcoming bust. Part of those valuations comes from an increasingly complex, interconnected web of deals as AI companies invest in one another. Oracle, Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI have all announced various investment deals worth tens of billions. In September, chipmaker Nvidia announced a deal to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI. But Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said this month that "we still haven't completed a definitive agreement, but we're working with them." The comments underscored how much distance there is between a splashy investment announcement and a binding contractual obligation. At the same time Oracle's shares decline, so do the fortunes of the company's majority shareholder, Larry Ellison. Ellison, ranked as the world's second-richest person by Bloomberg Billionaires, has a fortune worth more than $280 billion. Ellison's son, David, is making a hostile $108 billion bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, trying to upend an agreement Warner Bros. already has to sell its movie studios and HBO to streaming giant Netflix. David Ellison is backstopping his bid with the family's fortune, which rests in large part on shares of Oracle. Steve Kopack is a senior reporter at NBC News covering business and the economy.

Title: Oracle shares fall 14% on increase in data centre spending

Oracle stock slumped after it reported disappointing revenues on Wednesday alongside a $15 billion (€12.8 billion) increase in its planned spending on data centres this year to serve artificial intelligence groups. Shares in Larry Ellison’s database company fell 14 per cent on Thursday. The move came as Oracle reported revenues of $16.1 billion in the last quarter, up 14 per cent from the previous year but below analysts’ estimates. Oracle raised its forecast for capital expenditure this financial year by more than 40 per cent to $50 billion. The outlay, largely directed to building data centres, climbed to $12 billion in the quarter, above expectations of $8.4 billion. Its long-term debt including operating leases increased to $116.3 billion, up 44 per cent from a year ago. Oracle has launched an aggressive drive to catch up with much larger cloud players such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft in the race to supply the vast amount of computing power that AI groups including OpenAI and Anthropic need to train and run their models. [ Oracle’s share price surge suggests the AI trade still has momentumOpens in new window ] Clay Magouyrk, Oracle’s co-chief executive, said its cloud contracts would “quickly add revenue and margin to our infrastructure business” as he defended the vast investments. Yet the company said it expected full-year revenues to remain unchanged from its previous forecast of $67 billion. It expected to generate $4 billion more in revenue the following fiscal year. Total bookings for future revenue, known as remaining performance obligations, rose 15 per cent to $523 billion in the three months to the end of November, supported by deals with Meta and Nvidia. Investors initially welcomed the push into AI from Oracle. Shares surged after its last earnings in September when it disclosed it had added more than $300 billion in bookings, largely driven by data centre contracts with OpenAI. But the stock has given up its gains since then as investors worry about the large amounts Oracle will have to borrow and spend on infrastructure for the ChatGPT maker — and concerns over the start-up’s ability to pay for these contracts in the years ahead. Debt investors have also soured on the company. Oracle’s Big Tech rivals such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google have helped reassure investors about their large capital investments by posting strong earnings from their vast cloud units. But in the last quarter, Oracle’s cloud infrastructure business, which includes its data centres, posted worse than expected revenues of $4.1 billion. Ellison’s company is also relying more heavily on debt to fuel its expansion. - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Bill Gates Has a Warning for AI Investors

One of America’s legendary tech founders has a warning for AI investors: They can't all be winners. “Not all of these valuations will end up going up. Some of them will go down," Bill Gates, co-founder of tech giant Microsoft (MSFT), said of AI stocks in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday. "It’s going to be hyper-competitive. A reasonable percentage of those companies won’t be worth that much.” Microsoft is among the tech giants whose massive investments in artificial intelligence have fueled the AI bubble debate raging on Wall Street. The so-called hyperscalers—Microsoft, Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Oracle (ORCL)—are expected to spend $400 billion on infrastructure—much of it dedicated to training and running AI models—this year, and more than $500 billion next year. The AI boom has been the driving force behind the stock market rally for much of the past three years. But the rally has faltered in recent months due to lofty valuations and concerns that tech giants are overspending on AI. Some experts are reminding investors to pick and choose. Some investors worry the sheer size of those figures has encouraged speculation on Wall Street, causing some AI stocks to trade at eye-watering valuations. Software firm Palantir (PLTR) has a price-to-earnings ratio of more than 400, one of the highest in the S&P 500. Shares of chip designers Broadcom (AVGO) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) have soared this year on hopes they can take market share from AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA); those gains have nudged their PE ratios above 100, more than three times that of the S&P 500 as a whole. Then there's the cohort of unprofitable startups commanding lofty valuations in private markets. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, isn't expected to turn a profit before the end of the decade. Yet the start up was valued at $500 billion in October, which would make it the 16th largest public company in America. The AI buildout has turbocharged the sales and profits of some companies, leaving their valuations relatively steady despite big stock gains. AI demand has accelerated growth in the cloud computing businesses of Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon, all three of which have PE ratios hovering around 30. Booming demand for Nvidia’s chips made it a $4.5 trillion company, but shares trade at a relatively modest 45 times earnings. Bubble jitters have hit tech stocks several times since ChatGPT sparked the AI craze on Wall Street. In November, the Magnificent Seven nearly entered a technical correction. Less established competitors like Oracle (ORCL) and CoreWeave (CRWV) have performed even worse. As with past pullbacks, investors shook off valuation concerns and bought the dip, lifting tech stocks out of their slump. As of Wednesday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was just 1% off its record high from late October. Stock valuations aside, Gate said he's confident in AI's potential to transform society and power advancements in health, education, and agriculture. AI, he said, "is a technology that's deeply profound, that will reshape the world. There’s not the slightest doubt about that."

Title: Broadcom Shares Down 3% Thursday After Oracle's Earnings Disappoint

Live Blog Update #3 Published ← Back to Full Coverage: Live: Broadcom (AVGO) Q4 Earnings Coverage Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) reports earnings after the bell tonight, but shares are already on the move this morning. As of 10:15 a.m. ET, shares are down a little more than 3%. Let’s look at why investors are selling off Broadcom shares before it reports earnings today. The biggest story in technology today is a sell-off in AI stocks caused by Oracle‘s (Nasdaq: ORCL) Fiscal Q2 earnings last night. We were covering the earnings live yesterday. At first, Oracle shares slumped 6% as investors weren’t pleased with the company missing on earnings last quarter. However, the selling really kicked into overdrive when Oracle announced its capital expenditure plans were rising by $15 billion this year. There has been a divide in technology where stocks that have exposure to Google and its TPU chips have seen strong gains in recent months while stocks with more exposure to OpenAI have sold off. Broadcom has benefitted from this dynamic, as Google is its number one customer. However, Broadcom’s future growth (and diversification away from Google) relies heavily on OpenAI, so concerns about Oracle taking on too much risk will impact Broadcom as well. We’re seeing a rotation out of riskier sector towards more conservative ones during today’s trading. Materials stocks are up 1.69%, Financials are up 1%, Health Care stocksa re up .98%. Meanwhile, Information Technology stocks are down 1.35%. This rotation out of highly appreciated stocks is hitting Broadcom. A final reason for Broadcom’s drop today is just likely some profit-taking before earnings. The company is up 73% year-to-date. Put another way, Broadcom has outperformed every Magnificent 7 stock, and is now larger than Mag 7 constituents like Meta Platforms and Tesla. With year-end approaching and fears that AI has reached a ‘bubble’ stage growing on Wall Street, we’re likely seeing some profit-taking before the company releases earnings tonight. With Broadcom’s conference call over, we’ll be ending our updates. Here are three takeaways from their earnings if you’re just joining us: Once again, you can read our updates below if you want more details on Broadcom’s earnings. And before you leave, make sure to check out our AI Investor Podcast. On the AI Investor Podcast, we don’t just discuss the biggest news in the space, we also give actionable recommendations. So far, our average recommendation is up 74%! In our next episode we’ll be diving deeper into Broadcom’s earnings, so subscribe to make sure you get a notification as soon as it’s released! As we noted in our prior update, Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) shares fell during the company’s conference call. Let’s unpack some of the highlights from the call and look at the reasons why shares collapsed during it. All conference call transcriptions are compliments of S&P Capital IQ. 1.) Broadcom Announces An Additional $11 Billion Order from Anthropic : “These XPUs, I may add, are not only been used to train and influence internal workloads by our customers, the same XPUs in some situations have been extended externally to other LLM peers, best exemplified at Google, where the TPUs use in creating Gemini, have also been used for AI cloud computing by Apple, Coherent and SSI as an example. And the scale at which we see this happening could be significant. And as you are aware, last quarter, Q3 ’25, we received a $10 billion order to sell the latest TPU Ironwood racks to Anthropic. And this was our fourth customer that we mentioned. And in this quarter Q4, we received an additional $11 billion order from the same customer for delivery in late 2026.” The big ‘announcement’ from the call was Hock Tan noting the company now has $21 billion in TPU orders from Anthropic, a massive sum equal to about 25% of Wall Street’s revenue estimates for calendar 2026. This large order is likely the reason Broadcom was able to guide AI Semiconductor revenue above consensus to doubling in Fiscal 2026. 2.) Broadcom has an AI Backlog of $73 Billion It Expects to Deliver Across the Next 18 Months “Well, to answer your first question, what we said is correct that as of now, we have $73 billion of backlog in place secured of XPUs, switches, DSPs, lasers for AI data centers that we anticipate shipping over the next 18 months. And obviously, this is as of now, I mean, we fully expect more bookings to come in over that period of time. And so don’t take that $73 billion as that’s the revenue that we ship over the next 18 months. We’re just saying we have that now and in that bookings has been accelerating. “ Broadcom’s CEO also noted that this bookings number is a current snapshot, and actual deliveries could top $73 billion in AI sales across the next 18 months as Broadcom takes additional orders. Overall, there was no specific negative news to point to for Broadcom’s drop. That is to say, often when a stock drops sharply during its conference call it’s because the company announced disappointing guidance or new material information that will be a negative. There wasn’t anything in Broadcom’s call that was a red flag. However, here are a few reasons that contributed to Broadcom’s drop. Broadcom shares have taken off in several recent conference calls, but today the opposite happened. Shares are down 4%, a reversal from the 3% gains when the call started, we’ll post our notes from the call shortly. We’ll slow updates as we listen to Broadcom’s conference call. Here are a few important notes: As of 4:45 p.m. ET, Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) shares are holding onto 3% gains after-hours. Next up, the company’s conference call begins at 5 p.m. We expect Wall Street to focus on the following key areas: As a reminder, here were the key themes from the company’s last conference call. 1. Broadcom’s AI Engine Accelerates — XPUs Now the Center of Gravity Broadcom said AI semiconductors remain the company’s defining growth driver, with Q3 AI revenue climbing 63% YoY to $5.2B. The biggest shift: custom XPUs now make up 65% of AI revenue, as Broadcom gains share across all three legacy hyperscale customers. Management also confirmed a major new catalyst, a fourth XPU customer that has already placed more than $10B in AI rack orders, shipping in Q3 FY26. CEO Hock Tan signaled that FY26 AI growth will be even faster than FY25’s 50–60% pace, calling the outlook “fairly material.” 2. Networking Becomes the Next Bottleneck — Ethernet Takes the Lead As AI clusters scale toward 100,000+ compute nodes, Broadcom said networking is emerging as the key constraint and competitive battleground. Tan highlighted new product launches,Tomahawk 5, Tomahawk 6, and Jericho4, designed for scale-up, scale-out, and scale-across architectures, including multi–data center clusters. Broadcom framed Ethernet as the long-term winner over proprietary interconnects like NVLink, InfiniBand, or emerging UALink, citing its maturity, openness, and leadership position inside hyperscaler designs. XPUs are being built natively around Ethernet interfaces, reinforcing Broadcom’s advantage. 3. VMware Transformation Enters Phase Two — Private Cloud at Scale Broadcom reported 17% YoY growth in infrastructure software, driven by strong uptake of VMware Cloud Foundation. More than 90% of the top 10,000 VMware customers have now adopted VCF, marking the end of the licensing transition phase. The next stage is a multi-year deployment cycle as enterprises build out private cloud environments capable of running both traditional workloads and emerging AI jobs. Tan noted that Broadcom is intentionally commoditizing servers, storage, and networking to lower total cost of ownership for customers — a strategic lever to compete with public cloud. Traction in the mid-market remains mixed, but large-enterprise adoption continues to expand. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) shares are up 3.2% after-hours. Here are some key reasons shares are surging. Why is guidance so strong? The likely answer is Google scaling its TPU project above Wall Street’s expectations. Beyond Broadcom, that’s great news for companies like Lumentum, Celestica, and TTMI Technologies. All three of those companies are also up after-hours. Broadcom (AVGO) will host its earnings call on Thursday, December 11 at 2:00 pm PT. You can join live by visiting the investor relations page here. As we’ve noted, Broadcom shares have seen massive moves during several recent conference calls. So we recommend getting the full details on what the company shares in tonight’s call. We will post an update after the call concludes so if you stay on this page, you will receive our analysis on the call. Broadcom delivered robust growth in Q4 2025, with revenue up 28.2% to $18.02 billion and net income nearly doubling to $8.52 billion. Cash and equivalents surged 73.1% to $16.18 billion, while operating cash flow climbed 37.5% to $7.70 billion. Broadcom announced it was raising its dividend to $.65 per share. That puts the company at a $2.60 target in Fiscal 2026. That’s not a massive yield, but the company does stay committed to returning capital to shareholders. The biggest reason Broadcom’s yield is low is because shares keep rising at such impressive rates. Shareholders can live with that situation. Let’s focus on the quotes from Broadcom CEO Hock Tan in their earnings release: “In Q4, record revenue of $18.0 billion grew 28% year-over-year, driven primarily by AI semiconductor revenue increasing 74% year-over-year. We see the momentum continuing in Q1 and expect AI semiconductor revenue to double year-over-year to $8.2 billion, driven by custom AI accelerators and Ethernet AI switches. We forecast Q1’26 total revenue of $19.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA of 67%.” Note that in Q4 AI semiconductor revenue was up 74% year-over-year but the forecast for Q1 is for it to double year-over-year. That is to say, Broadcom’s guidance implies acceleration beyond what Wall Street was modeling. Simply put, that is why shares are positive after-hours. As of 4:25, Broadcom shares are up 2.5%. Here’s a breakdown of the key figures from Broadcom’s (Nasdaq: AVGO) Q4 earnings. First quarter guidance of $19.1 billion, which tops expectations of $18.31 billion. That’s a solid beat on forward guidance. Here’s what the company had to say about AI revenue in the first quarter: “We see the momentum continuing in Q1 and expect AI semiconductor revenue to double year-over-year to $8.2 billion, driven by custom AI accelerators and Ethernet AI switches.” Shares are currently up 2.8%. Broadcom’s semiconductor sales were $11.07 billion which clears estimates of $10.73 billion. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) earnings just hit the newswires and we’re reviewing them and will continue issuing new updates and analysis. However, here are the key numbers to focus on. What Broadcom Announced: Wall Street expected: Shares are initially up 3%. This is a developing story and we will continue updating this blog. Stay on it for more updates which will automatically load. Five more minutes until Broadcom reports. It’s a quiet earnings night with Lululemon, Costco, and Restoration Hardware being the other notable names reporting after the bell. The stock market just closed and Broadcom finished the day down 1.6%. Here are three notes before the company reports. 1.) As a reminder, we expect Broadcom’s earnings will drop at 4:15 p.m. ET. If you see a share price reaction before then, its likely just ‘noise.’ 2.) If you want to receive news and updates the moment Oracle’s earnings release, simply stay on this page. New updates should push automatically. 3.) If you haven’t had a chance yet, subscribe to our AI Investor Podcast. It’s free and offers new AI stock recommendations (the average recommendation in the portfolio is up 74% so far!) We’ll be breaking down Broadcom’s earnings in more detail in our next episode. As we noted earlier, the biggest story in the market today was Oracle (Nasdaq: ORCL) shares continuing to plummet. The company has been selling off across the past quarter on fears it was becoming too reliant on OpenAI. After Oracle announced capital expenditures would reach $50 billion in 2026 (a $15 billion rise from their last guidance), investors hit the exits. Fear peaked today at about 10 a.m. ET. At that time, the iShares Semiconductor ETF was down about 3%. As the day has gone on, stocks in the sector have rebounded. Yet, the iShares Semiconductor ETF is still down .83% in late trading while the Dow Jones is up 1.35%. Shares of Broadcom rebounded alongside most other semiconductor stocks, but are still down about 1.5% in late trading. NVIDIA saw a similar drop in the morning, and its shares are down 1.6% today. As a reminder, we expect Broadcom’s earnings to release at about 4:15 p.m. ET. The moment they hit the newswires we’ll begin posting live news and analysis. You don’t need to do anything for new updates to appear. Simply leave this page open and we’ll post the most important figures, analysis of Broadcom’s earnings, and a look at why the stock is either rising or falling after earnings. It’s almost time for Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) to report its Fiscal Q4 earnings. Here are five things you need to know to you prepared for tonight’s fourth quarter earnings release. Broadcom reports after the bell today, but if the stock is moving at 4:03 p.m. ET, it’s likely nothing related to earnings. We expect Broadcom’s earnings to hit newswires at 4:15 p.m. ET. Once earnings release, our team of technology analysts will begin breaking down Broadcom’s earnings and providing our analysis on why Wall Street is either buying up shares or selling Broadcom after its earnings release. Here’s what Wall Street expects when Broadcom reports tonight: What’s interesting is that while Broadcom’s share price has been rising steadily, up 61% the past six months, near-term expectations haven’t risen much. 90 days ago the street expected $1.87 in adjusted earnings and headed into today, that number is still just $1.87. If near-term expectations aren’t rising, you’re probably wondering why Broadcom’s stock has seen such incredible gains recently. The short answer is that expectations for out years (2027, 2028, 2029) have been rising steadily. For example, EPS expectations for next year were $9.17 ninety days ago and are now $9.39. By 2029, Wall Street expects Broadcom to generate $22.17 in adjusted profits as custom ASIC projects from new customers enter mass production. Prediction market Polymarket currently has 96% odds that Broadcom will beat earnings last quarter. If Broadcom missed earnings, we’d expect a fairly sharp negative reaction to its share price. Even if Broadcom tops estimates, that’s no assurance shares will rise. Finally, expect the reaction to Broadcom’s earnings to focus less on their performance last quarter and more on their guidance and what CEO Hock Tan says on the company’s conference call. Wall Street expects Broadcom to guide to $18.31 billion in sales in Fiscal Q1, so the company will likely need to top that number or else the initial reaction to their earnings release will be negative. It’s worth noting that in multiple recent quarters, shares of Broadcom have taken off after quotes from Hock Tan. Tan is a very savvy CEO, and will often save information for Broadcom’s call that he knows will be received warmly by the market. The company’s conference call starts at 5 p.m. ET. 24/7 Wall St. is focused on helping investors win big in the AI space. Every earnings season, we publish hundreds of live blogs like you’re reading right now, but our top resource is The AI Investor Podcast. In the Podcast, we break down the biggest news in AI each week and issue AI recommendations for our $500,000 AI Portfolio. One of our better recommendations: buying shares of Broadcom on October 11, 2024, and buying more on December 6, 2024. Those two recommendations are up 125% and 127%. Other great recommendations we’ve made include Credo (up 455%), Lumentum (339%), Ciena (243%), and SK Hynix (up 163%). We’ve embedded our latest episode below. Subscribing is absolutely free.

Coming off EPS beats versus consensus estimates and just about at all time highs, Broadcom is trading lower today, down 1.72% before earnings drop in just a few hours. As a refresher, here are the biggest themes from last quarter’s conference call: 1. Broadcom’s AI Engine Accelerates — XPUs Now the Center of Gravity Broadcom said AI semiconductors remain the company’s defining growth driver, with Q3 AI revenue climbing 63% YoY to $5.2B. The biggest shift: custom XPUs now make up 65% of AI revenue, as Broadcom gains share across all three legacy hyperscale customers. Management also confirmed a major new catalyst, a fourth XPU customer that has already placed more than $10B in AI rack orders, shipping in Q3 FY26. CEO Hock Tan signaled that FY26 AI growth will be even faster than FY25’s 50–60% pace, calling the outlook “fairly material.” 2.

XPUs are being built natively around Ethernet interfaces, reinforcing Broadcom’s advantage. 3. VMware Transformation Enters Phase Two — Private Cloud at Scale Broadcom reported 17% YoY growth in infrastructure software, driven by strong uptake of VMware Cloud Foundation. More than 90% of the top 10,000 VMware customers have now adopted VCF, marking the end of the licensing transition phase. The next stage is a multi-year deployment cycle as enterprises build out private cloud environments capable of running both traditional workloads and emerging AI jobs. Tan noted that Broadcom is intentionally commoditizing servers, storage, and networking to lower total cost of ownership for customers — a strategic lever to compete with public cloud. Traction in the mid-market remains mixed, but large-enterprise adoption continues to expand. Broadcom enters Thursday’s post-market earnings report trading at $412.97, near its 52-week high of $414.61 and aligned with Wall Street’s consensus target of $412.02. The stock sits 15% above its 50-day moving average ($358.44) and 49% above its 200-day ($277.13), signaling strong bullish momentum. Key support levels formed at $390-$395 and $380-$385, tested and held during early December. Volume spiked to 47.3 million shares on November 24’s +8.7% breakout, with recent sessions maintaining elevated activity at 31.5 million shares—suggesting institutional positioning ahead of results. The technical setup reflects extreme optimism: 93.6% of analysts rate AVGO as Buy or Strong Buy, while Polymarket traders assign 68% odds the stock rises post-earnings. With four consecutive earnings beats averaging +2.64% above estimates, investors bet AI infrastructure demand drives another upside surprise when management reports at 4:00pm ET. Prediction markets signal overwhelming confidence in Broadcom beating the $1.87 non-GAAP EPS consensus when results drop after market close. Polymarket data shows 96% probability of a beat, with traders pushing odds higher throughout the day, up 8.1% in the last 24 hours alone. The market’s $21,200 total volume, with 75% traded in the past day, reflects conviction rather than speculation. That confidence isn’t baseless. Broadcom has beaten estimates for eight consecutive quarters, averaging a 2.7% surprise. Apply that pattern and the actual print lands near $1.92, right where the crowd expects. The tight bid-ask spread ($0.951/$0.964) shows minimal disagreement among participants. With the stock already up 21% over the past month to $413, traders have priced in success. The real test: whether management’s guidance justifies the rally or triggers profit-taking despite a beat.

Title: Tiger teeth, dried seahorses and shark fins sold illegally on Facebook, BBC finds

Endangered species, including tiger body parts, shark fins and pangolin scales, are being offered for sale on Facebook, BBC News has found. One Chinese user posted videos of a tiger in a cage that was for sale as well as pictures of tiger bones and teeth, while another included two live tiger cubs in a box. An image showed a tiger head and bones for sale piled up on scales. A seller told the BBC his products "can be shipped to the UK". He said a 10cm-long tooth would cost 2,000 Chines yuan (about £213) and that he could sell me tiger bones for 3,600 yuan per kilo (about £380). Another seller, who was offering shark fins, claimed to ship from the US to the UK and charged $50 per kilo (about £37). The sale of endangered species such as tigers and pangolin is illegal in the UK and CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, closely regulates international trade in species under threat. The voluntary agreement, signed by more than 180 countries and other bodies, only allows the trade if it is both legal and sustainable. It comes as Interpol has announced the results of a global crackdown on the wildlife trade, which it says led to the seizure of nearly 30,000 live animals. Meta, which owns Facebook, says it does not allow the sale of endangered species and removes such content. The UK has strict laws on what species can be imported legally. However, BBC News also found British companies selling dried seahorses, which can only be traded in the UK if the seller can certify they were sustainably harvested. In practice, that's not possible and supplying them is likely to break the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, punishable by a fine or prison sentence. One seller was found promoting them as a tonic for mothers who have just given birth and as a medicine for combating coughs. There is no scientific evidence to support this. When contacted, the seller - based in the north of England - immediately sent pictures of the seahorses they had in stock. Ordering online cost just over £60. Two days after placing the order three packets containing 15 dead, dried seahorses arrived in the post. The delivery had no documentation about the origin of the specimens but did include a recipe on how to make soup with them. The BBC showed the samples to Neil Garrick-Maidment, from the Seahorse Trust, who said it "made him sick to his stomach". He said they could only have been supplied illegally. Three pregnant males were among the order - male seahorses carry as many as 200 young. Mr Garrick-Maidment says that, kilo for kilo, seahorses are currently worth as much as silver and warned further price rises could mean they are fished to extinction. The global trade in endangered species is estimated to be worth £17bn per year and Interpol assesses it to be the fourth largest international crime type behind drugs smuggling, people smuggling and arms trafficking. The pangolin, which is the only mammal completely covered in scales, has become the most trafficked animal on earth and is now critically endangered. A seller in Laos was found to be offering pangolin scales for sale on Facebook. He told the BBC he charged $150 per kilo. One user even offered to sell rhino horn and suggested making contact via private message. In a statement, Meta said: "We do not allow the sale of endangered species on our platforms." The social media platform says it takes down that kind of material as soon as it becomes aware of it, saying it encourages users to "report any content they think may violate our policies". Today Interpol announced the result of Operation Thunder, a month-long global initiative to combat the trade in endangered species. Authorities in 134 countries were involved in the operation which included the seizure of nearly 30,000 live animals and 30 tonnes of animal parts. Interpol says the growth in live animal seizures is driven by the exotic pet trade, but the market in bushmeat is also on the rise. Kenyan authorities seized 400kg of giraffe meat as part of the global crackdown and, in Belgium, primate flesh was found. More than 4,000 shark fins were also intercepted. Danny Hewitt, Border Force's director for UK command operations who oversaw the British arm of Op Thunder, said there had been a 73% increase in seizures compared to 2023. That included live snakes, tarantulas and lovebirds found hidden in vehicles stopped at the UK border. As populations move to the UK they drive demand, he added. The trade has been driven by organised crime, and in many cases, customers who don't understand the harm they are doing. Mr Hewitt added: "They may not have been illegal in other parts of the world, but they are illegal in the UK." A historical site dating back to the last Saxon king is being revitalised. Seal pups and jellyfish-like organisms are among the creatures washed up on Dorset's beaches. California's governor Gavin Newsom issued a strongly-worded statement in response to the executive order. The BBC asked people in Toronto and DC if they think an Australian-style, under-16 social media ban would work in Canada and the US. The new sonar technology hopes to help protect the fish on the River Dee from predators. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Title: Shares of Oracle slide 10% on revenue miss and rising capital expenditures

UPDATED 18:50 EST / DECEMBER 10 2025 by Mike Wheatley Shares of Oracle Corp. dropped more than 10% in extended trading today after the cloud and database giant missed expectations on quarterly revenue while going full-steam ahead on its ongoing artificial intelligence infrastructure buildout. The company reported second-quarter earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of $2.26 per share, easily beating Wall Street’s target of $1.64 per share. However, though revenue grew by 16% from a year earlier, to $16.06 billion, it fell short of the $16.21 billion analyst estimate. In terms of profitability, Oracle showed a big improvement, with net income of $6.14 billion in the quarter, up from just $3.15 billion in the year-ago quarter. However, the company’s guidance was perhaps a tad discouraging for investors. Oracle executives said they’re looking for earnings of between $1.70 and $1.74 in the third-quarter, which is only in-line with the Street’s forecast of $1.72. The company also called for revenue growth of between 19% and 21% versus the Street’s $16.87 billion estimate, which implies 19% growth. Oracle said it delivered $7.98 billion in cloud revenue during the quarter, above the $7.92 billion consensus estimate. Within that segment, cloud infrastructure revenue came to $4.1 billion, up 68% from a year ago. Today was the first quarterly earnings call by Oracle’s new co-Chief Executive Officers Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia, who took over the job from former CEO Safra Catz in September. In a call with analysts, Sicilia highlighted a number of new cloud infrastructure customer wins with companies including Airbus, Deutsche Bank, LSEG, Panasonic, Canon and Rubrik. Valoir analyst Rebecca Wettemann told SiliconANGLE that it’s quite telling that Sicilia felt the need to highlight so many customer wins during the call. “The market has been really nervous about Oracle’s overreliance on OpenAI and other AI plays from a RPO and forecast perspective, so this litany of customer wins and apps growth acceleration shows some welcome diversity,” she said. Oracle’s software business didn’t fare so well, however, with revenue declining 3%, to $5.88 billion, falling short of the Street’s $6.06 billion estimate. On the other hand, Oracle’s future does look promising, with the company pointing to remaining performance obligations that soared 438% from a year ago, to a staggering $523 billion. RPO, as the metric is known, refers to contracted revenue that has not yet been realized, and is really a measure of the company’s enormous backlog of orders, mostly for cloud infrastructure capacity. Wall Street had been forecasting RPO of $501.8 billion. Oracle Principle Financial Officer Doug Kehring said on the call that the increase was the result of new commitments by customers including Meta Platforms Inc., Nvidia Corp. and others, and told analysts that the company is hoping to be able to convert this revenue sooner than expected. “This is good news for Oracle and its capex story,” Wettemann said, referring to Oracle’s runaway capital expenditures. The company has been trying to position itself at the center of the AI boom by committing to a massive data center buildout, and expects capex to increase to $50 billion this year, up from $21.2 billion in the previous fiscal year. While the increased capex has boosted the company’s revenue and backlog, some investors have become worried about the enormous amounts of debt it has taken on to fund its investments. Much of Oracle’s backlog stems from OpenAI Group PBC, which has committed to spending more than $300 billion on Oracle’s cloud infrastructure services over the next five years. “The longer the backlog sits there, the greater the risk that Oracle can’t monetize it, or the AI landscape changes enough that certain customers can’t pay on their commitments,” Wettemann explained. Constellation Research analyst Holger Mueller said some eagle-eyed investors may have noted that Oracle’s growing revenue is coming at a steep cost, resulting in lower profitability as it generates more sales. “The problem is that the $2 billion in cloud revenue growth only translated to around half a billion in operating income,” the analyst said. “At the same time, Oracle keeps spending like a drunken sailor on capex and is cash flow-negative by $13 billion. While this could end up great if AI pans out, it could also become a problem.” Kehring tried to reassure investors, telling analysts on the call that the company remains committed to maintaining its investment-grade debt rating. “There are other financing options through customers that may bring their own chips to be installed in our data centers and suppliers who may lease their chips rather than sell them,” he said. “Both of these options enable Oracle to synchronize our payments with our receipts and borrow substantially less than most people are modeling.” Mueller agreed that the debt Oracle has been taking on isn’t a problem. “With interest payments at approximately $1 billion, the debt load is more than manageable for the company,” he said. The company said its earnings during the quarter were boosted by a $2.7 billion pretax gain on the sale of its interest in chip design business Ampere, which is set to be acquired by SoftBank Group Corp. for $6.5 billion. Oracle announced the sale in March. Oracle founder, Chairman and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison (pictured), who remains the company’s most influential executive, said the decision to sell Ampere was taken because he thinks it no longer makes sense to continue designing, manufacturing and using its own chips in its data centers. “The company is committed to a policy of chip neutrality,” he said. “[It needs] to be prepared and able to deploy whatever chips our customers want to buy.” The earnings call comes on the back of a 23% drop in Oracle’s share price last month, its worst monthly performance since 2021. But although the stock declined further today, it’s still up more than 33% in the year to date, ahead of the broader, technology-focused Nasdaq index, which has gained just 22% this year.

Business Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan makes a speech on stage in Taipei, Taiwan May 19, 2025. REUTERS/Ann Wang SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 10 : When the chairman of AI chip startup Rivos wanted Intel to bid for the company, he had no need to phone the chip giant. That’s because the chairman of Rivos was also Intel’s CEO: Lip-Bu Tan. Tan had pitched Intel’s board on buying Rivos in the summer of 2025, but he had no luck. The board told Tan he had a conflict in representing both Rivos’ interests and Intel’s, and he lacked a strategy on artificial intelligence to justify a deal, three people familiar with the events told Reuters. Tan asked one of his lieutenants at Intel to pitch a new AI plan, leading to partnership talks with Rivos, the people said. But now there was a problem: social media giant Meta had been stalking Rivos and made an offer for the company. Meta’s interest spurred Intel to make its own offer. Meta countered with a sweetened bid. The competition for the startup drove the deal and incentives above the $2 billion valuation that Rivos had sought in fundraising earlier this year. Some of the sources pinned this package at around $4 billion. Subscribe to our Chief Editor’s Week in Review Our chief editor shares analysis and picks of the week's biggest news every Saturday.

Loading Meta announced plans to buy Rivos in September. By then the bidding process had boosted the startup’s returns at Meta’s expense.Reuters was unable to determine how much the Intel CEO profited personally as a Rivos shareholder because the financials are not public. But in a blog post on its website, Tan’s venture-capital firm, Walden Catalyst, touted how he had delivered a “successful outcome” for its investors and congratulated the Rivos team for their “remarkable achievement.”The events show one of at least three instances where Intel has pursued deals that benefit Tan financially either by exploring bids for startups or investing in them directly through Intel’s investment arm, Intel Capital, said two of the sources. Intel declined to make Tan available for an interview for this story. Meta did not respond to requests for comment, and Rivos declined to comment.VENTURE CAPITALIST AS CEOIntel hired Tan in March in part for his experience as a venture capitalist and unparalleled industry connections as a longtime investor in tech companies. Those connections have helped Intel clinch a $5 billion investment from Nvidia and a $2 billion investment from SoftBank.Since Tan’s arrival, Intel has implemented policies requiring Tan to recuse himself from participating in investment decisions where he might benefit, two sources said. Specifically, Tan cannot attend or vote in decision meetings of Intel’s board or Intel Capital’s investment committee if he has a conflict in a venture or company-wide transaction, the sources said.Such recusals are commonplace in industry. But they had not been an issue to the same degree at Intel because its leadership prior to Tan had fewer potentially conflicting investments, three of the sources said.In the event of a Tan recusal for Intel Capital, the first two sources said, decision-making authority for the venture unit’s investment committee goes to Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner, who reports to Tan.Intel declined to make Zinsner available for an interview.Intel’s board knew when it appointed Tan that his web of investments in chip and technology companies could create conflicts, but the board accepted this, hoping that Tan can revive the iconic U.S. chipmaker, which lost $19 billion last year, one of the people said.Intel’s 11 independent board directors did not individually comment on Tan, but in response to Reuters queries, an Intel spokesperson said: “The Board of Directors believes it’s important that Intel fully leverage his vast network and position Intel to capture the next wave of industry innovation and opportunity.”Tan’s dealmaking comes as the administration of President Donald Trump agreed to make an $8.9 billion investment for what would be the largest ownership stake in the chipmaker, designating it as strategic to the U.S. and effectively making its citizens shareholders.Some chip-industry analysts have said in research notes that they welcomed Tan’s industry relationships. “He has a wide view across the ecosystem,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon in an interview with Reuters. “And that’s helpful for Intel.”Tan does not perceive his dealmaking at Intel to be conflicted, said two of the sources, who are familiar with his thinking. Tan believes that his roles at these startups and at Intel make him uniquely able to negotiate transactions that benefit all parties, the people said.In a statement, an Intel spokesperson disputed that Tan’s dealmaking posed any problem. “The company has an unwavering commitment to the highest standards of corporate governance, integrity, and accountability,” the spokesperson said. Tan’s “extensive relationships across the global semiconductor ecosystem are invaluable as Intel positions itself to capitalize on a rapidly evolving industry landscape.”The Securities and Exchange Commission would not require Intel to disclose related-party transactions that could involve Tan until the spring of 2026, a year after its last disclosure, which took place the week after his start date.U.S. regulations require such disclosures when transactions personally benefiting corporate officers exceed $120,000, though experts have said smaller dollar amounts can be material to investors if the information would inform a decision to sell or purchase stock.DEALS TO REVIVE INTEL’S AI STRATEGYTan believed Intel needed to buy Rivos because earlier in-house efforts to enter the AI chip market had failed, one of the sources said. In the statement, the Intel spokesperson said Tan was “advancing its AI strategy” and “revitalizing its engineering-centric, customer-first culture.”Rivos was one of the major targets for Intel where Tan had interests on both sides of the deal. Tan also pitched Intel’s board on buying the troubled AI computing startup SambaNova, where Tan served as executive chairman, the first three sources said.The rationale - debated inside Intel - was that SambaNova also could provide more tech and talent to build AI chips, the sources said.SambaNova declined to comment on any talks between the startup and Intel. “While we’re always exploring strategic options, our focus remains on accelerating the roadmap, delivering products to market, and supporting our customers,” a spokesperson said.Intel also declined to comment on the SambaNova talks.Tan’s portfolio has drawn scrutiny before. In April, Reuters documented how Tan’s investment firms had stakes in more than 600 Chinese companies, some with military ties, drawing a rebuke by Trump that the U.S. chip manufacturer’s CEO was "highly CONFLICTED.”According to a White House official, Tan subsequently cleared up Trump’s concerns in an Oval Office meeting, which paved the way for collaboration on U.S. national and economic security. In September, Trump publicly celebrated Intel’s rising share price following Tan’s Nvidia deal.Intel’s share price has roughly doubled since Tan’s appointment, outpacing the percentage gains of the S&P 500 and chip leader Nvidia in that time. TAKING CONTROL OF INTEL CAPITALSoon after his appointment as CEO, Tan took direct control of Intel’s investment arm, Intel Capital, reversing a plan to spin it off. Instead, he reorganized the company so that Intel Capital would report to him, according to two of the sources, for reasons Intel has not disclosed. Its investment committee would be composed solely of Tan and one of his direct reports, finance chief Zinsner, said three people familiar with the change.Since then, Intel Capital has invested in several companies in which Tan has a stake through his investment vehicles or venture capital firms, which include A&E Investment LLC, Celesta Capital and Walden International, three of the sources said. Some Intel staff have felt an obligation to explore such deals to win Tan’s support, two of them said.One such investment was in proteanTecs, which announced a late-stage, Series D funding round in September. Intel Capital upped its existing stake in the startup, helping increase the value of Tan’s holdings through A&E Investment and Celesta Capital, funding data shows.ProteanTecs declined to comment. A&E Investment, Walden Catalyst and Walden International did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, Celesta Capital said Tan "has always acted with integrity and a commitment to doing what is right for all stakeholders.”Before Tan became CEO, Intel Capital co-invested with him or his investment firms at least 12 times since 2019, funding announcements show.Intel is not alone in having a venture capital arm. That’s common at large technology companies, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet and Qualcomm. But unlike those other companies, Intel is unusual in having a CEO who oversees its venture unit while also leading unrelated investment firms, a Reuters review of leadership at those companies shows.Reuters was unable to determine how much Intel’s recent investments had in total increased Tan’s net worth, estimated to be well over $500 million.Two corporate governance experts consulted by Reuters said Tan’s dealmaking raises red flags due to the conflicts inherent in forging deals with his own portfolio companies.One of them also said that Intel could benefit from Tan’s connections. “You don't want to preclude making good investments because your CEO is well connected,” said Daniel Taylor, a professor at the Wharton School specializing in corporate disclosures and insider trading.TAN TOUTS HIS BOOK The Intel CEO has consistently highlighted his portfolio in public appearances. In one of his first presentations as the Intel chief in March, he talked up his 251 chip-related investments, an online video from the occasion shows. At an October chip conference in Phoenix, Tan gave a speech representing Intel that featured slides touting still more holdings, including in proteanTecs and SambaNova.Intel’s code of conduct encourages executives to disclose potential conflicts to the company’s board and top legal and compliance officers for resolution. “We avoid situations that interfere or appear to interfere with our ability to act in the best interests of Intel,” the code of conduct states. It adds that staff must mind conflicts arising from “an ownership interest in an Intel supplier, customer, or competitor” and from “outside employment that interferes with your obligations to Intel.”The two corporate governance experts said Tan should have dropped his portfolio investments, placed them in a blind trust or set up a special committee of the board to remove potential conflicts with his investment portfolio. Some lawyers have said special committees are not always necessary, and some scholars argue outside board roles apprise executives of strategic information.Intel declined to say if Tan had taken any such measure.The Intel board’s independent Audit Committee “actively monitors, reviews, and approves, as appropriate, any related-party transactions in strict accordance with Intel’s rigorous Related-Party Transactions Policy,” the company spokesperson said.The policy has exceptions. Transactions in which an Intel executive owns less than 10 per cent of a company that is party to a deal, whose value does not exceed $1 million or 2 per cent of that company’s revenue, are deemed to be “pre-cleared,” the policy states. It was not clear how many investments by Intel, if any, fell under this policy, which pre-dated Tan’s leadership. INTEL EXPLORES BID FOR A STRUGGLING STARTUPIn 2018, SambaNova was a startup with lofty ambitions to build an AI computing system that could rival Nvidia’s AI hardware and software ecosystem. Tan’s venture firm Walden International co-led SambaNova’s $56 million Series A funding round that year, which secured Tan’s position on its board. Over the years, SambaNova hoovered up money from investors: more from Tan’s venture firm and, around 2021, a big check from SoftBank, where Tan served as a board director until 2022. The $676 million Series D round led by SoftBank valued SambaNova at around $5 billion and gave Tan’s holdings a healthy increase on paper.SoftBank declined to answer if Tan had a role in persuading it to invest in SambaNova. But the startup’s ambitious vision wasn’t panning out, three people familiar with the matter said. Customers had more demand for Nvidia’s chips, which are good for a wide variety of uses in AI. That contrasts with the silicon from SambaNova, which is designed for more specific AI applications.In 2024, Tan stepped in as SambaNova’s new executive chairman in the hopes that he could help grow its business faster. The company was poised to run out of its cash, three people familiar with the matter said. It laid off 77 people in California, or reportedly about 15 per cent of its staff, in April. The chip startup tried to drum up interest for another funding round, but found few takers, two sources said. Its revenue meant it would have to fundraise or go up for sale at a lower valuation, said the people and a third source. Bankers pegged its worth at $2 billion to around $3 billion at most, two of the sources said.Tan asked Intel to look at a deal with the chipmaker over the summer, three sources said. In recent weeks, some of SambaNova’s investors provided additional financing to tide over the startup, two people familiar with the insider round said. In a statement to Reuters, a SambaNova spokesperson confirmed the startup recently secured additional funding, adding its business “is performing really well.”Deal talks with SambaNova are ongoing, two of the sources said. Intel and SambaNova have signed a non-binding term sheet, one of them said. Meta announced plans to buy Rivos in September. By then the bidding process had boosted the startup’s returns at Meta’s expense. Reuters was unable to determine how much the Intel CEO profited personally as a Rivos shareholder because the financials are not public. But in a blog post on its website, Tan’s venture-capital firm, Walden Catalyst, touted how he had delivered a “successful outcome” for its investors and congratulated the Rivos team for their “remarkable achievement.” The events show one of at least three instances where Intel has pursued deals that benefit Tan financially either by exploring bids for startups or investing in them directly through Intel’s investment arm, Intel Capital, said two of the sources.

Instead, he reorganized the company so that Intel Capital would report to him, according to two of the sources, for reasons Intel has not disclosed. Its investment committee would be composed solely of Tan and one of his direct reports, finance chief Zinsner, said three people familiar with the change. Since then, Intel Capital has invested in several companies in which Tan has a stake through his investment vehicles or venture capital firms, which include A&E Investment LLC, Celesta Capital and Walden International, three of the sources said. Some Intel staff have felt an obligation to explore such deals to win Tan’s support, two of them said. One such investment was in proteanTecs, which announced a late-stage, Series D funding round in September. Intel Capital upped its existing stake in the startup, helping increase the value of Tan’s holdings through A&E Investment and Celesta Capital, funding data shows. ProteanTecs declined to comment. A&E Investment, Walden Catalyst and Walden International did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, Celesta Capital said Tan "has always acted with integrity and a commitment to doing what is right for all stakeholders.” Before Tan became CEO, Intel Capital co-invested with him or his investment firms at least 12 times since 2019, funding announcements show. Intel is not alone in having a venture capital arm. That’s common at large technology companies, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet and Qualcomm. But unlike those other companies, Intel is unusual in having a CEO who oversees its venture unit while also leading unrelated investment firms, a Reuters review of leadership at those companies shows. Reuters was unable to determine how much Intel’s recent investments had in total increased Tan’s net worth, estimated to be well over $500 million. Two corporate governance experts consulted by Reuters said Tan’s dealmaking raises red flags due to the conflicts inherent in forging deals with his own portfolio companies. One of them also said that Intel could benefit from Tan’s connections. “You don't want to preclude making good investments because your CEO is well connected,” said Daniel Taylor, a professor at the Wharton School specializing in corporate disclosures and insider trading. TAN TOUTS HIS BOOK The Intel CEO has consistently highlighted his portfolio in public appearances. In one of his first presentations as the Intel chief in March, he talked up his 251 chip-related investments, an online video from the occasion shows. At an October chip conference in Phoenix, Tan gave a speech representing Intel that featured slides touting still more holdings, including in proteanTecs and SambaNova. Intel’s code of conduct encourages executives to disclose potential conflicts to the company’s board and top legal and compliance officers for resolution. “We avoid situations that interfere or appear to interfere with our ability to act in the best interests of Intel,” the code of conduct states. It adds that staff must mind conflicts arising from “an ownership interest in an Intel supplier, customer, or competitor” and from “outside employment that interferes with your obligations to Intel.” The two corporate governance experts said Tan should have dropped his portfolio investments, placed them in a blind trust or set up a special committee of the board to remove potential conflicts with his investment portfolio. Some lawyers have said special committees are not always necessary, and some scholars argue outside board roles apprise executives of strategic information. Intel declined to say if Tan had taken any such measure. The Intel board’s independent Audit Committee “actively monitors, reviews, and approves, as appropriate, any related-party transactions in strict accordance with Intel’s rigorous Related-Party Transactions Policy,” the company spokesperson said. The policy has exceptions. Transactions in which an Intel executive owns less than 10 per cent of a company that is party to a deal, whose value does not exceed $1 million or 2 per cent of that company’s revenue, are deemed to be “pre-cleared,” the policy states. It was not clear how many investments by Intel, if any, fell under this policy, which pre-dated Tan’s leadership. INTEL EXPLORES BID FOR A STRUGGLING STARTUP In 2018, SambaNova was a startup with lofty ambitions to build an AI computing system that could rival Nvidia’s AI hardware and software ecosystem. Tan’s venture firm Walden International co-led SambaNova’s $56 million Series A funding round that year, which secured Tan’s position on its board. Over the years, SambaNova hoovered up money from investors: more from Tan’s venture firm and, around 2021, a big check from SoftBank, where Tan served as a board director until 2022. The $676 million Series D round led by SoftBank valued SambaNova at around $5 billion and gave Tan’s holdings a healthy increase on paper. SoftBank declined to answer if Tan had a role in persuading it to invest in SambaNova. But the startup’s ambitious vision wasn’t panning out, three people familiar with the matter said. Customers had more demand for Nvidia’s chips, which are good for a wide variety of uses in AI. That contrasts with the silicon from SambaNova, which is designed for more specific AI applications. In 2024, Tan stepped in as SambaNova’s new executive chairman in the hopes that he could help grow its business faster. The company was poised to run out of its cash, three people familiar with the matter said. It laid off 77 people in California, or reportedly about 15 per cent of its staff, in April. The chip startup tried to drum up interest for another funding round, but found few takers, two sources said. Its revenue meant it would have to fundraise or go up for sale at a lower valuation, said the people and a third source. Bankers pegged its worth at $2 billion to around $3 billion at most, two of the sources said. Tan asked Intel to look at a deal with the chipmaker over the summer, three sources said. In recent weeks, some of SambaNova’s investors provided additional financing to tide over the startup, two people familiar with the insider round said. In a statement to Reuters, a SambaNova spokesperson confirmed the startup recently secured additional funding, adding its business “is performing really well.” Deal talks with SambaNova are ongoing, two of the sources said. Intel and SambaNova have signed a non-binding term sheet, one of them said.

Title: Algorithms and Capitalism: Cleaning Up The Waze Parade

John Battelle's Search Blog Thoughts on the intersection of tech, business, and society. Do you feel it? A simmering discontent with the state of capitalism in American life? I certainly do. My kids engage with social media only if they have to – never because they wish to. They believe their feeds are manipulated by corporate interests, and they are distrustful of anyone who believes otherwise. My wife is convinced that anything she buys online – particularly the bigger ticket items like flights or hotels – is priced based on what algorithms calculate she can afford to pay – not what might be fair or offered to others. Parents in my friend group are terrified that their kids are using ChatGPT as a confidante and therapist whose motivations are unfathomable. The stock market keeps pushing ever upwards, but my colleagues are increasingly convinced a crash is around the corner. Something just feels….off. The complex socio-economic system that we’re all a part of seems rigged. And we feel powerless to do anything about it. Two news items from the past few days underscore this gloomy sensibility. From the Times comes this gem: Same Product, Same Store, but on Instacart, Prices Might Differ. Here’s the takeaway: digital aggregators like Instacart (and Uber, and Expedia, etc.) use a sophisticated combination of data, algorithms, and AI to extract as much profit as they can from each and every consumer with which they interact. It’s called dynamic pricing, and it’s an inevitable consequence of capitalism colliding with the digital economy. Turns out, my wife was right. The second item offering proof that something’s rotten in the state of capitalism comes courtesy of 404 Media, which uncovered some downright insidious behavior from Meta’s Instagram (I know, shocking!). In short, Instagram is creating AI-generated content based on its own users’ posts, then injecting that content into Google so as to drive more traffic back to Instagram. It’s a perfect example of “growth hacking,” a practice that Meta/Facebook perfected more than ten years ago. Turns out, my kids were right to not trust their social media feeds. What connects these two stories is how the “customer” is treated by tech platforms. The Instagram user whose posts are being distorted in pursuit of traffic, the Instacart consumer who sees a price driven by extractive algorithms – they’re being manipulated by forces they can’t see or understand. In short, they’re being treated like commodified inputs to a system, not valued customers who might have a choice as to where they shop or spend their time. They’re being taken for granted. Have you ever found yourself part of a “Waze parade,” blindly following the algorithm’s increasingly complicated instructions through suburban streets just to save a few seconds of time on your way to your destination? It kind of feels like that’s happening everywhere now, across every digital surface that’s intermediated by a profit-seeking technology company. We know it sucks, but hell, we’re already way off the highway and deep in unfamiliar territory, so let’s just keep making those lefts and rights, and hope we get there, right? Is there a way out of this algorithmic prison? I’m not sure, but I sense personal AI agents – ones that work only for us – could be a big part of the solution. I’ve written recently about the problems facing personal agents, and heard back from someone who’s working on those problems via a “loyal agents” consortium led by Consumer Reports, amongst others. They call their work “conscious commerce” – and I’m cheering for their success. From a recent post: If agentic commerce is built the way the internet works today, we’ll get an economy even more by advertising and other perverse incentives—one where your buying decisions are based on obscure deals between online retailers and AI companies, where all the intimate conversations you share flow into an ad platform, and where manipulative AI chatbots whisper in your ear over the months to spend more, or more foolishly. It doesn’t have to be that way. If we’re intentional, we can use this moment to build something much more consumer-centric—an economy where consumers have more power than ever before. Hear hear! — You can follow whatever I’m doing next by signing up for my site newsletter here. Thanks for reading. “Dynamic Pricing”. Don’t you love the way they gaslight us by making it sound like it’s something that we all might benefit from? Also, it is proven that using an Amex Platinum card jacks up your pricing on your Uber ride. Amex benefits from this too – as people spend more money on the card.

Title: Will Meta Platforms (META) Stock Hit $1,000 in 2027?

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Derick Hudson / iStock Editorial via Getty Images Guided by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is a business seeking a direction. Is Meta Platforms a social media giant, a metaverse pioneer, or an artificial intelligence (AI) technology trailblazer? Some investors have expressed disappointment about the performance of Meta Platforms’ Reality Labs metaverse/virtual reality (VR) business unit. On the other hand, Meta Platforms has more than 4 billion eyeballs on its social media applications globally. Thus, Meta Platforms is a force to be reckoned with and META stock could be poised for significant upside. In an optimistic scenario, the Meta Platforms share price could even reach $1,000 by the end of 2027 — but don’t place any bets until you’ve reviewed the catalysts and concerns. Since 2025 is nearly over, we can assess the year’s performance of Meta Platforms stock. The shares are up 11% year to date and are only up 5% over the past 12 months. That’s a decent performance, but it’s nothing to write home about. Frankly, META stock hasn’t been so magnificent lately even though Meta Platforms is a member of the Magnificent Seven. To hit $1,000 by the end of 2027, Meta Platforms stock would have to rise 54% from its current price of approximately $650. Even with a strong finish in December of this year, META stock would need to gain around 25% in 2026 and another 25% in 2027. At least, we can say that Meta Platforms stock looks reasonably valued after a decent but not spectacular 2025. At the moment, Meta Platforms has a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28.79x, which isn’t excessive for a mega-cap technology firm. While it doesn’t appear to be over-valued, Meta Platforms will still need to demonstrate robust financial growth for META stock to reach $1,000. So, let’s take a glance at the most recent quarterly data and analyze Meta Platforms’s growth trajectory. Here are the need-to-know data points. In the third quarter of 2025, Meta Platforms’ total revenue grew 26.2% year over year to $51.242 billion versus $40.589 billion in the year-earlier quarter. As usual, the majority of Meta Platforms’ quarterly revenue ($50.082 billion for Q3 2025) came from the company’s Advertising segment. Looking at it from another angle, nearly all of Meta Platforms’ quarterly revenue ($50.772 billion) was derived from the company’s “Family of Apps” (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc.). Suffice it to say, then, that app-based advertisements continue to be Meta Platforms’ bread and butter. Turning to the company’s bottom-line results, Meta Platforms’ net income declined 82.7% from $15.688 billion in the year-earlier quarter to $2.709 billion in Q3 2025. This occurred despite Meta Platforms aforementioned revenue growth. There’s no need to panic about this, though, as Meta Platforms’ year-on-year net income decline may just be a one-time tax-accounting issue. As it turns out, the company’s “provision for income taxes” jumped from $2.134 billion in 2024’s third quarter to $18.954 billion in the third quarter of 2025. The critics may be willing to overlook Meta Platforms’ steep net income drop-off, but there’s another possible objection. In particular, they could complain that Meta Platforms relies heavily on social media app ad revenue. That may be the case, but Zuckerberg clearly wants to expand Meta Platforms into new, intriguing technology fields. Will the CEO’s bold vision be a boon for Meta Platforms, though? After multiple quarters of operating losses from Meta Platforms’ Reality Labs division, investors may be relieved to see Zuckerberg shifting his attention to AI instead of the metaverse. Lately, there’s been talk about Meta Platforms possibly gearing up to introduce next-generation AI glasses next year. However, Meta Platforms will need to effectively parlay its legions of app users into a loyal base of AI tech consumers. Until that happens, Meta Platforms’ foray into AI technology will be quite costly. From 2024’s third quarter to Q3 2025, Meta Platforms’ research and development expenses ramped up 35.5%, from $11.177 billion to $15.144 billion. Plus, there are no signs that Meta Platforms’ spending spree will end anytime soon. Just this year, Meta Platforms expects to have spent a mind-blowing $72 billion on AI technology. Over the next three years, the company plans to spend $600 billion on U.S. infrastructure and job investments, presumably to include AI tech development. It’s a costly pivot, and there’s no assurance that Meta Platforms will convert its millions of eyeballs into enthusiastic AI glasses wearers. Remember, Meta Platforms tried to get consumers to wear VR headsets but that didn’t work out as planned. Meta Platforms can rely on its massive app advertising revenue for growth, but the next chapter in the company’s story hasn’t been written yet. Zuckerberg’s AI obsession may turn out to be a costly misstep, just as Reality Labs ended up. Hence, it’s possible but unlikely that META stock will gain 25% in 2026 and then gain another 25% in 2027. Getting Meta Platforms shares to $1,000 is a tall order that would require strong evidence that the company’s spending spree is justified. So far, the proof just isn’t there yet, so investors should stay cautious for now. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

Title: AI Business Deals Are Getting a Bit 2008-ish

The last time so much wealth was tied up in such obscure overlapping arrangements was just before the 2008 financial crisis. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. Updated at 10:15 a.m. ET on December 12, 2025 A company that most people have never heard of is among the year’s best-performing technology firms—and a symbol of the complex, interconnected, and potentially catastrophic ways in which AI companies do business these days. CoreWeave’s IPO in March was the largest of any tech start-up since 2021, and the company’s share price has subsequently more than doubled, outperforming even the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks. On Wall Street, CoreWeave is regularly referred to as one of the most important companies powering the AI revolution. In the past few months, it has announced a $22 billion partnership with OpenAI, a $14 billion deal with Meta, and a $6 billion arrangement with Nvidia. Not bad for a former crypto-mining firm turned data-center operator with zero profits and billions of dollars in debt on its books. CoreWeave’s business model consists of buying up lots of high-end computer chips, and building or leasing data centers to house those chips. It then rents out those assets to AI companies that need computing power but prefer not to take on the huge up-front costs themselves. If this is straightforward enough, CoreWeave’s financial situation is anything but. The company expects to bring in $5 billion in revenue this year while spending roughly $20 billion. To cover that gap, the company has taken on $14 billion in debt, nearly a third of which comes due in the next year. Many of these loans were issued by private-equity firms at high interest rates, and several use complex forms of financial engineering, such as giving the money to newly formed legal entities created for the explicit purpose of borrowing on CoreWeave’s behalf (more on that later). CoreWeave also faces $34 billion in scheduled lease payments that will start kicking in between now and 2028. From the May 2025 issue: The new king of tech The money that CoreWeave is making, meanwhile, comes from just a few intimately connected sources. A single customer, Microsoft, is responsible for as much as 70 percent of its revenue; its next biggest customers, Nvidia and OpenAI, might make up another 20 percent, though exact numbers are hard to find. Nvidia is also CoreWeave’s supplier of chips and one of its major investors, meaning CoreWeave is using Nvidia’s money to buy Nvidia’s chips and then renting them right back to Nvidia. OpenAI is also a major CoreWeave investor and has close financial partnerships with both Nvidia and Microsoft. All of this might make CoreWeave the purest distillation of a trend sweeping through the AI sector. In recent months, tech giants including Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle have been making gargantuan investments in new data centers, tying together their fortunes through circular financing deals, and borrowing huge piles of debt from lightly regulated lenders. The companies and their most ardent backers argue that these deals will set them up to capture the limitless profits of the coming AI revolution. But the last time the economy saw so much wealth tied up in such obscure overlapping arrangements was just before the 2008 financial crisis. If the AI revolution fails to materialize on the scale or the timeline that the industry expects, the economic consequences could be very ugly indeed. The extreme financialization of the AI sector reflects a simple reality: The infrastructure required to train and run AI systems is so expensive that not even the largest companies have enough cash to pay for it all. Spending on data centers is conservatively projected to exceed $400 billion this year, roughly the size of the economy of Denmark; McKinsey estimates that it will reach nearly $7 trillion by 2030. Creative measures are necessary to pay for all of this investment. At the center of the action is Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company. Companies that train and run AI systems, such as Anthropic and OpenAI, need Nvidia’s chips but don’t have the cash on hand to pay for them. Nvidia, meanwhile, has plenty of cash but needs customers to keep buying its chips. So the parties have made a series of deals in which the AI companies are effectively paying Nvidia by handing over a share of their future profits in the form of equity. The chipmaker has struck more than 50 deals this year, including a $100 billion investment in OpenAI and (with Microsoft) a $15 billion investment in Anthropic. Formally, these transactions don’t obligate the AI companies to spend money on Nvidia’s chips—an Nvidia spokesperson told Bloomberg that the company “does not require any of the companies we invest in to use Nvidia technology”—but in practice, that’s where the money goes. OpenAI has made its own series of deals, including agreements to purchase $300 billion of computing power from Oracle, $38 billion from Amazon, and $22 billion from CoreWeave. Those cloud providers, in turn, are an important market for Nvidia’s chips. OpenAI has also invested in several smaller AI start-ups, which in exchange have agreed to pay for ChatGPT enterprise accounts. Even when represented visually, the resulting web of interlocking relationships is almost impossible to track. Together, these arrangements amount to an entire industry making a double-or-nothing bet on a product that is nowhere near profitable. A single company, OpenAI, is simultaneously a major source of revenue and investment for several cloud companies and chipmakers; a close financial partner to Microsoft, Oracle, and Amazon; a significant customer for Nvidia; and a leading investor in AI start-ups. And yet the company is projected to generate only $10 billion this year in revenue—less than a fifth of what it needs annually just to fund its deal with Oracle. It is on track to lose at least $15 billion this year, and doesn’t expect to be profitable until at least 2029. By one estimate, AI companies collectively will generate $60 billion in revenue against $400 billion in spending this year. The one company that is making a lot of money from the AI boom, Nvidia, is doing so only because everyone else is buying its chips in the hopes of obtaining future profits. The AI companies and their boosters see this as a gamble worth taking. Demand for AI services, they point out, is growing at an exponential rate. According to calculations by Azeem Azhar, a widely cited AI-industry analyst, the direct revenues from AI services have increased nearly ninefold over the past two years. If that pace continues, then it’s only a matter of time before AI companies will begin making record-shattering profits. “I think people who fixate on exactly how these investments are being financed are stuck in an outdated way of thinking,” Azhar told me. “Everyone is assuming that this technology will improve at a linear pace. But AI is an exponential technology. It’s a whole different paradigm.” If, however, AI does not produce the short-term profits its proponents envision—if its technical advances slow down and its productivity-enhancing effects underwhelm, as a mounting body of evidence suggests may be the case—then the financial ties that bind the sector together could become everyone’s collective downfall. The extreme concentration of stock-market wealth in a handful of tech companies with deep financial links to one another could make an AI crash even more severe than the dot-com crash of the 2000s. And a stock-market correction might be the least of America’s worries. When equity investments go bad, investors might lose their shirts, but the damage to the real economy is typically contained. (The dot-com crash, for example, didn’t cause mass unemployment.) But the AI build-out is so expensive that it can’t be funded by equity investments alone. To finance their investments, AI companies have taken on hundreds of billions of dollars in debt, a number that Morgan Stanley expects to rise to $1.5 trillion by 2028. When a bunch of highly leveraged loans go bad at the same time, the fallout can spread throughout the financial system and trigger a major recession. The AI sector’s debt is, of course, not guaranteed to go bad. But the complex way in which it is arranged and packaged isn’t reassuring. For instance, earlier this year, Meta decided to build a new data center in Louisiana that will cost $27 billion. Instead of applying for a loan from a traditional lender, the company partnered with Blue Owl Capital, a private-equity firm, to set up a separate legal entity, known as a special-purpose vehicle, or SPV, that will borrow the money on Meta’s behalf, build the data center according to Meta’s instructions, and then lease it back to Meta. Because Blue Owl is technically the majority owner of the project, this setup keeps the debt off of Meta’s balance sheet, enabling the company to keep borrowing at low interest rates without worrying about a hit to its credit rating. Other companies, including xAI, CoreWeave, and Google, have borrowed or plan to borrow huge sums through similar kinds of arrangements. Meta has described its arrangement with Blue Owl as an “innovative partnership” that is “designed to support the speed and flexibility required for Meta’s data center projects.” But the reason the credit-rating system exists is to give lenders and investors a clear sense of the risk they are taking on when they issue a loan. A long history exists of companies trying to circumvent that system. In the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis, several major financial institutions used SPVs to keep billions of dollars in household debt off of their balance sheets. Enron, the energy corporation that famously collapsed in 2001 after a massive accounting scandal, used SPVs to mask its shady accounting practices. “When I see arrangements like this, it’s a huge red flag,” Paul Kedrosky, a managing partner at SK Ventures and research fellow at MIT who has written extensively about financial-engineering techniques, told me. “It sends the signal that these companies really don’t want the credit-rating agencies to look too closely at their spending.” SPVs aren’t the only 2008-era financing tool making a comeback. Data-center debt totaling billions of dollars is being sliced up into “asset-backed securities,” which are then bundled and sold to investors. This is not an inherently problematic way for companies to fund their borrowing. But Kedrosky argues that during periods of heightened speculation, these vehicles turn debt into a financial product whose worth is disconnected from the value of the underlying asset it represents—which can encourage reckless behavior. “Investors see these complex financial products and they say, I don’t care what’s happening inside—I just care that it’s highly rated and promises a big return,” Kedrosky said. “That’s what happened in ’08. And once that kind of thinking takes off, it becomes really dangerous.” Rogé Karma: Just how bad would an AI bubble be? Then there are the so-called GPU-backed loans. Several data-center builders and cloud providers, including CoreWeave, have obtained multibillion-dollar loans to purchase chips by posting their existing chips as collateral, just as many homeowners used their homes as collateral to take out loans for second and third homes in the 2000s. But, as Advait Arun, an analyst at the Center for Public Enterprise, notes in a recent report on the AI sector’s finances, whether that collateral will hold its value is far from clear. When new chip models are released, the value of older models tends to fall. According to Arun, if the collapse in chip prices were steep enough, a vicious cycle could ensue. As older chips fall in value, any loan using those chips as collateral suddenly becomes at risk of default. Lenders might respond by calling in their loans early, before companies have the revenue to pay them back. At that point, the lender might try to sell the chips to recoup their investment, but that will only flood the market with even more chips, driving down the values of existing chips even further, causing other lenders to call in their loans and so on. “A few months ago I would have told you that this was building toward a repeat of the dot-com crash,” Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, told me. “But all of this debt and financial engineering is making me increasingly worried about a 2008-like scenario.” The federal government responded to the 2008 crisis by limiting the ability of traditional banks to take on big, risky loans. Since then, however, private-equity firms, which aren’t subject to the same regulatory scrutiny as banks, have gotten more heavily into the lending business. As of early this year, these firms had lent about $450 billion in so-called private credit to the tech sector, including financing several of the deals discussed above. And, according to one estimate, they will lend it another $800 billion over the next two years. “If the AI bubble goes bust, they are the ones that will be left holding the bag,” Arun told me. A private-credit bust is almost certainly preferable to a banking bust. Unlike banks, private-equity firms don’t have ordinary depositors. In theory, if their loans fail, the groups that will be hurt the most are institutional investors, such as pension funds, university endowments, and hedge funds, limiting the damage to the broader economy. The problem is that nobody knows for certain that this is the case. Private credit is functionally a black box. Unlike banks, these entities don’t have to disclose who they are getting their money from, how much they’re lending, how much capital they’re holding, and how their loans are performing. This makes it impossible for regulators to know what risks exist in the system or how tied they are to the real economy. Evidence is growing that the links between private credit and the rest of the financial system are stronger than once believed. Careful studies from the Federal Reserve estimate that up to a quarter of bank loans to nonbank financial institutions are now made to private-credit firms (up from just 1 percent in 2013) and that major life-insurance companies have nearly $1 trillion tied up in private credit. These connections raise the prospect that a big AI crash could lead to a wave of private-credit failures, which could in turn bring down major banks and insurers, Natasha Sarin, a Yale Law School professor who specializes in financial regulation, told me. “Unfortunately, it usually isn’t until after a crisis that we realize just how interconnected the different parts of the financial system were all along,” she said. An AI-induced financial disaster is far from inevitable. Still, given the warning signs, one would hope for the federal government to be doing what it can to reduce the risk of a crisis. Instead, the Trump administration is doing the opposite. In August, the president signed an executive order that instructs federal agencies to loosen regulations so that ordinary 401(k) holders can invest directly in “alternative assets” such as, yes, private credit, a change that could expose a far broader swath of the public to the fallout if AI loans go bad. Perhaps that is the key difference between 2008 and 2025. Back then, the federal government was caught off guard by the crash; this time, it appears to be courting one.

Ours is a remarkable moment in world history. A transformative technology is ascending, and its supporters claim it will forever change the world. To build it requires companies to invest a sum of money unlike anything in living memory. News reports are filled with widespread fears that America’s biggest corporations are propping up a bubble that will soon pop. During my visits to clients in Asia and the Middle East last month, I was often asked about the possibility of a bubble surrounding artificial intelligence, and my discussions gave rise to this memo. I want to start off with my usual caveats: I’m not active in the stock market; I merely watch it as the best barometer of investor psychology. I’m also no techie, and I don’t know any more about AI than most generalist investors. But I’ll do my best. One of the most interesting aspects of bubbles is their regularity, not in terms of timing, but rather the progression they follow. Something new and seemingly revolutionary appears and worms its way into people’s minds. It captures their imagination, and the excitement is overwhelming. The early participants enjoy huge gains. Those who merely look on feel incredible envy and regret and – motivated by the fear of continuing to miss out – pile in. They do this without knowledge of what the future will bring or concern about whether the price they’re paying can possibly be expected to produce a reasonable return with a tolerable amount of risk. The end result for investors is inevitably painful in the short to medium term, although it’s possible to end up ahead after enough years have passed. I’ve lived through several bubbles and read about others, and they’ve all hewed to this description. One might think the losses experienced when past bubbles popped would discourage the next one from forming. But that hasn’t happened yet, and I’m sure it never will. Memories are short, and prudence and natural risk aversion are no match for the dream of getting rich on the back of a revolutionary technology that “everyone knows” will change the world. I took the quote that opens this memo from Derek Thompson’s November 4 newsletter entitled “AI Could Be the Railroad of the 21st Century. Brace Yourself,” about parallels between what’s going on today in AI and the railroad boom of the 1860s. Its word-for-word applicability to both shows clearly what’s meant by the phrase widely attributed to Mark Twain: “history rhymes.” Understanding Bubbles Before diving into the subject at hand – and having read a great deal about it in preparation – I want to start with a point of clarification. Everyone asks, “Is there a bubble in AI?” I think there’s ambiguity even in the question. I’ve concluded there are two different but interrelated bubble possibilities to think about: one in the behavior of companies within the industry, and the other in how investors are behaving with regard to the industry. I have absolutely no ability to judge whether the AI companies’ aggressive behavior is justified, so I’ll try to stick primarily to the question of whether there’s a bubble around AI in the financial world. The main job of an investment analyst – especially in the so-called “value” school to which I subscribe – is to (a) study companies and other assets and assess the level of and outlook for their intrinsic value and (b) make investment decisions on the basis of that value. Most of the change the analyst encounters in the short to medium term surrounds the asset’s price and its relationship to underlying value. That relationship, in turn, is essentially the result of investor psychology. Market bubbles aren’t caused directly by technological or financial developments. Rather, they result from the application of excessive optimism to those developments. As I wrote in my January memo On Bubble Watch, bubbles are temporary manias in which developments in those areas become the subject of what former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan called “irrational exuberance.’’ Bubbles usually coalesce around new financial developments (e.g., the South Sea Company of the early 1700s or sub-prime residential mortgage-backed securities in 2005-06) or technological progress (optical fiber in the late 1990s and the internet in 1998-2000). Newness plays a huge part in this. Because there’s no history to restrain the imagination, the future can appear limitless for the new thing. And futures that are perceived to be limitless can justify valuations that go well beyond past norms – leading to asset prices that aren’t justified on the basis of predictable earning power. The role of newness is well described in my favorite passage from a book that greatly influenced me, A Short History of Financial Euphoria by John Kenneth Galbraith. Galbraith wrote about what he called “the extreme brevity of the financial memory” and pointed out that in the financial markets, “past experience, to the extent that it is part of memory at all, is dismissed as the primitive refuge of those who do not have the insight to appreciate the incredible wonders of the present.” In other words, history can impose limits on awe regarding the present and imagination regarding the future. In the absence of history, on the other hand, all things seem possible. The key thing to note here is that the new thing understandably inspires great enthusiasm, but bubbles are what happen when the enthusiasm reaches irrational proportions. Who can identify the boundary of rationality? Who can say when an optimistic market has become a bubble? It’s just a matter of judgment. Something that occurred to me this past month is that two of my best “calls” came in 2000, when I cautioned about what was going on in the market for tech and internet stocks, and in 2005-07, when I cited the dearth of risk aversion and the resulting ease of doing crazy deals in the pre-Global Financial Crisis world. First, in neither case did I possess any expertise regarding the things that turned out to be the subjects of the bubbles: the internet and sub-prime mortgage-backed securities. All I did was render observations regarding the behavior taking place around me. And second, the value in my calls consisted mostly of describing the folly in that behavior, not in insisting that it had brought on a bubble. Struggling with whether to apply the “bubble” label can bog you down and interfere with proper judgment; we can accomplish a great deal by merely assessing what’s going on around us and drawing inferences with regard to proper behavior. What’s Good About Bubbles? Before going on to discuss AI and whether it’s presently in a bubble, I want to spend a little time on a subject that may seem somewhat academic from the standpoint of investors: the upside of bubbles. You may find the attention I devote to this topic excessive, but I do so because I find it fascinating. The November 5 Stratechery newsletter was entitled “The Benefits of Bubbles.” In it, Ben Thompson (no relation to Derek) cites a book titled Boom: Bubbles and the End of Stagnation. It was written by Byrne Hobart and Tobias Huber, who propose that there are two kinds of bubbles: . . . “Inflection Bubbles” – the good kind of bubbles, as opposed to the much more damaging “Mean-reversion Bubbles” like the 2000’s subprime mortgage bubble. I find this a useful dichotomy. The financial fads I’ve read about or witnessed – the South Sea Company, portfolio insurance, and sub-prime mortgage-backed securities – stirred the imagination based on the promise of returns without risk, but there was no expectation that they would represent overall progress for mankind. There was, for example, no thought that housing would be revolutionized by the sub-prime mortgage movement, merely a feeling that there was money to be made from backing new buyers. Hobart and Huber call these “mean-reverting bubbles,” presumably because there’s no expectation that the underlying developments would move the world forward. Fads merely rise and fall. On the other hand, Hobart and Huber call bubbles based on technological progress – as in the case of the railroads and the internet – “inflection bubbles.” After an inflection-driven bubble, the world will not revert to its prior state. In such a bubble, “investors decide that the future will be meaningfully different from the past and trade accordingly.” As Thompson tells us: The definitive book on bubbles has long been Carlota Perez’s Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital. Bubbles were – are – thought to be something negative and to be avoided, particularly at the time Perez published her book. The year was 2002 and much of the world was in a recession coming off the puncturing of the dot-com bubble. Perez didn’t deny the pain: in fact, she noted that similar crashes marked previous revolutions, including the Industrial Revolution, railways, electricity, and the automobile. In each case the bubbles were not regrettable, but necessary: the speculative mania enabled what Perez called the “Installation Phase,” where necessary but not necessarily financially wise investments laid the groundwork for the “Deployment Period.” What marked the shift to the deployment period was the popping of the bubble; what enabled the deployment period were the money-losing investments. (All emphasis added) This distinction is very meaningful for Hobart and Huber, and I agree. They say, “not all bubbles destroy wealth and value. Some can be understood as important catalysts for techno-scientific progress.” But I would restate as follows: “Mean-reversion bubbles” – in which markets soar on the basis of some new financial miracle and then collapse – destroy wealth. On the other hand, “inflection bubbles” based on revolutionary developments accelerate technological progress and create the foundation for a more prosperous future, and they destroy wealth. The key is to not be one of the investors whose wealth is destroyed in the process of bringing on progress. Hobart and Huber go on to describe in greater depth the process through which bubbles finance the building of the infrastructure required by the new technology and thus accelerate its adoption: Most novel technology doesn’t just appear ex nihilo [i.e., from nothing], entering the world fully formed and all at once. Rather, it builds on previous false starts, failures, iterations, and historical path dependencies. Bubbles create opportunities to deploy the capital necessary to fund and speed up such large-scale experimentation – which includes lots of trial and error done in parallel – thereby accelerating the rate of potentially disruptive technologies and breakthroughs. By generating positive feedback cycles of enthusiasm and investment, bubbles can be net beneficial. Optimism can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Speculation provides the massive financing needed to fund highly risky and exploratory projects; what appears in the short term to be excessive enthusiasm or just bad investing turns out to be essential for bootstrapping social and technological innovations . . . A bubble can be a collective delusion, but it can also be an expression of collective vision. That vision becomes a site of coordination for people and capital and for the parallelization of innovation. Instead of happening over time, bursts of progress happen simultaneously across different domains. And with mounting enthusiasm . . . comes increased risk tolerance and strong network effects. The fear of missing out, or FOMO, attracts even more participants, entrepreneurs, and speculators, further reinforcing this positive feedback loop. Like bubbles, FOMO tends to have a bad reputation, but it’s sometimes a healthy instinct. After all, none of us wants to miss out on a once-in-a-lifetime chance to build the future. In other words, bubbles based on technological progress are good because they excite investors into pouring in money – a good bit of which is thrown away – to carpet-bomb a new area of opportunity and thus jump-start its exploitation. The key realization seems to be that if people remained patient, prudent, analytical, and value-insistent, novel technologies would take many years and perhaps decades to be built out. Instead, the hysteria of the bubble causes the process to be compressed into a very short period – with some of the money going into life-changing investment in the winners but a lot of it being incinerated. A bubble has aspects that are both technological and financial, but the above citations are from the standpoint of people who crave technological progress and are perfectly happy to see investors lose money in its interest. “We,” on the other hand, would like to see technological progress but have no desire to throw away money to help bring it about. Ben Thompson ends this discussion by saying, “This is why I’m excited to talk about new technologies, the prospect for which I don’t know.” I love the fact that he’s excited by future possibilities and at the same time admits that the shape of the future is unknown (in our world, we might say “very risky”). Assessing the Current Landscape Now let’s get down to what we used to call “brass tacks.” What do we know? First, I haven’t met anyone who doesn’t believe artificial intelligence has the potential to be one of the biggest technological developments of all time, reshaping both daily life and the global economy. We also know that in recent years, economies and markets have become increasingly dependent on AI: AI is responsible for a very large portion of companies’ total capital expenditures. Capital expenditures on AI capacity account for a large share of the growth in U.S. GDP. AI stocks have been the source of the vast majority of the gains of the S&P 500. As a Fortune headline put it on October 7: 75% of gains, 80% of profits, 90% of capex – AI’s grip on the S&P is total and Morgan Stanley’s top analyst is ‘very concerned’ Further, I think it’s important to note that whereas the gains in AI-related stocks account for a disproportionate percentage of the total gains in all stocks, the excitement AI injects into the market must have added a lot to the appreciation of non-AI stocks as well. AI-related stocks have shown astronomical performance, led by Nvidia, the leading developer of computer chips for AI. From its formation in 1993 and its initial public offering in 1999, when its estimated market value was $626 million, Nvidia briefly became the world’s first company worth $5 trillion. That’s appreciation of around 8,000x, or roughly 40% a year for 26+ years. No wonder imaginations have been fired. What Are the Areas of Uncertainty? I think it’s fair to say that while we know AI will be a source of incredible change, most of us have no idea exactly what it will be able to do, how it will be applied commercially, or what the timing will be. Who will be the winners, and what will they be worth? If a new technology is assumed to be a world changer, it’s invariably assumed that the leading companies possessing that technology will be of great value. But how accurate will that assumption prove to be? As Warren Buffett pointed out in 1999, “[The automobile was] the most important invention, probably, of the first half of the 20th century. . . . If you had seen at the time of the first cars how this country would develop in connection with autos, you would have said, ‘This is the place I must be.’ But of the 2,000 companies, as of a few years ago, only three car companies survived. So autos had an enormous impact on America but the opposite direction on investors.” (Time, January 23, 2012) In AI, there are some very strong leaders at present, including some of the world’s strongest and richest companies. But new technology is notoriously disruptive. Will today’s leaders prevail or give way to upstarts? How much will the arms race cost, and who will win? Similarly, what’s a share in an upstart worth? Unlike front runners worth trillions, it’s possible to invest in some would-be challengers at enterprise values in mere billions or even – might I say? – millions. On June 25, 2024, CNBC reported as follows: A team founded by college dropouts has raised $120 million from investors led by Primary Venture Partners to build a new AI chip to take on Nvidia. Etched CEO Gavin Uberti said the startup is betting that as AI develops, most of the technology’s power-hungry computing requirements will be filled by customized, hard-wired chips called ASICs. “If transformers go away, we’ll die,” Uberti told CNBC. “But if they stick around, we’re the biggest company of all time.” Even granting the possibility that Etched won’t become the biggest company of all time, if success could give them a valuation just one-fifth of Nvidia’s peak – a mere $1 trillion – what probability of success would be required to justify an investment of $120 million? Assuming for simplicity’s sake that the investment was for a 100% ownership stake, all you need is a belief that achieving the trillion-dollar value has a probability of one-tenth of a percent for an expected return of over eight times your money. Who’s to say Etched doesn’t have that chance? And in that case, why would anyone not play? The foregoing is what I call “lottery-ticket thinking,” in which the dream of an enormous payoff justifies – no, compels – participation in an endeavor with an overwhelming probability of failing. There’s nothing wrong with calculating expected values this way. Leading venture capitalists engage in it every day to great effect. But assumptions regarding the possible payoffs and their probabilities must be reasonable. Thinking about a trillion-dollar payout will override reasonableness in any calculation. Will AI produce profits, and for whom? Two things we know little or nothing about are the profits AI will produce for vendors and its impact on non-AI companies, primarily meaning those who employ it. Will AI be a monopoly or duopoly, in which one or two leading companies are able to charge dearly for the capabilities? Or will it be a highly competitive free-for-all in which a number of firms compete on price for users’ spending on AI services, making it a commodity? Or, perhaps most likely, will it be a mix of leading companies and specialized players, some of whom compete on price and others through proprietary advantages. It’s said that the services currently responding to AI queries, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, lose money on every query they answer (of course, it’s not unusual for participants in a new industry to offer “loss leaders” for a while). Will the leading tech firms – used to success in winner-take-all markets – be content to experience losses in their AI businesses for years in order to gain share? Hundreds of billions of dollars are being committed to the race for AI leadership. Who will win, and what will be the result? Likewise, what will be AI’s impact on the companies that use it? Clearly, AI will be a great tool for enhancing users’ productivity by, among other things, replacing workers with computer-sourced labor and intelligence. But will this ability to cut costs add to the profit margins of the companies that employ it? Or will it simply enable price wars among those companies in the pursuit of customers? In that case, the savings might be passed on to the customers rather than garnered by the companies. In other words, is it possible AI will increase the efficiency of businesses without increasing their profitability? Should we worry about so-called “circular deals”? In the telecom boom of the late 1990s, in which optical fiber became overbuilt, fiber-owning companies engaged in transactions with each other that permitted them to report profits. If two companies own fiber, they just have an asset on their books. But if each buys capacity from the other, they can both report profits . . . so they did. In other cases, manufacturers loaned network operators money to buy equipment from them, before the operators had customers to justify the buildout. All this resulted in profits that were illusory. Nowadays, deals are being announced in which money appears to be round-tripped between AI players. People who believe there’s an AI bubble find it easy to view these transactions with suspicion. Is the purpose to achieve legitimate business goals or to exaggerate progress? Adding to worries, critics say, some of the deals that OpenAI has made with chipmakers, cloud computing companies and others are oddly circular. OpenAI is set to receive billions from tech companies but also sends billions back to the same companies to pay for computing power and other services. . . . Nvidia has also made some deals that have raised questions about whether the company is paying itself. It announced that it would invest $100 billion in OpenAI. The start-up receives that money as it buys or leases Nvidia’s chips. . . . Goldman Sachs has estimated that Nvidia will make 15 percent of its sales next year from what critics also call circular deals. (The New York Times, November 20) Noteworthily, OpenAI has made investment commitments to industry counterparties totaling $1.4 trillion, even though it has yet to turn a profit. The company makes clear that the investments are to be paid out of revenues received from the same parties and that it has ways to back out of these commitments. But all this raises the question of whether the AI industry has developed a perpetual motion machine. (On this subject, I’ve been enjoying articles questioning the ability of people to relate to the word “trillion,” and I think this idea is spot on. A million dollars is a dollar a second for 11.6 days. A billion dollars is a dollar a second for 31.7 years. We get that. But a trillion dollars is a dollar a second for 31,700 years. Who can get their head around the significance of 31,700 years?) What will be the useful life of AI assets? We have to wonder whether the topic of obsolescence is being handled correctly in AI-land. What will be the lifespan of AI chips? How many years of earnings growth should be counted on in assigning p/e ratios for AI-related stocks? Will chips and other aspects of AI infrastructure last long enough to repay the debt undertaken to buy them? Will artificial general intelligence (a machine capable of doing anything the human brain can do) be achieved? Will that be the end of progress, or might there be further revolutions, and what firms will win them? Will firms reach a position where technology is stable and they can extract economic value from it? Or will new technologies continually threaten to supplant older ones as the route to success? In this connection, a single issue of an FT newsletter briefly mentioned two developments that suggest the fluid nature of the competitive landscape: A study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and open-source AI start-up Hugging Face found that the total share of downloads of new Chinese-made open models rose to 17 per cent in the past year. The figure surpasses the 15.8 per cent share of downloads from American developers such as Google, Meta and OpenAI – the first time Chinese groups have beaten their American counterparts. . . . Nvidia shares fell sharply yesterday on fears that Google is gaining ground in artificial intelligence, erasing $115bn in market value from the AI chipmaker. (FirstFT Americas, November 26) Dynamic change creates the opportunity for incredible new technologies, but that same dynamism can threaten the leading companies’ reign. Amid all these uncertainties, investors must ask whether the assumption of continued success incorporated in the prices they’re paying is fully warranted. Is exuberance leading to speculative behavior? For an extreme example, I’ll cite the trend toward venture capital investments in startups via $1 billion “seed rounds.” Here’s one vignette: Thinking Machines, an AI startup helmed by former Open AI executive Mira Murati, just raised the largest seed round in history: $2 billion in funding at a $10 billion valuation. The company has not released a product and has refused to tell investors what they’re even trying to build. “It was the most absurd pitch meeting,” one investor who met with Murati said. “She was like, ‘So we're doing an AI company with the best AI people, but we can’t answer any questions.’ ” (“The Is How the AI Bubble Will Pop,” Derek Thompson Substack, October 2) But that’s ancient history. . . already two months old. Here’s an update: Thinking Machines Lab, the artificial intelligence startup founded by former Open AI executive Mira Murati, is in early talks to raise a new funding round at a roughly $50 billion valuation, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday. The startup was last valued at $12 billion in July, after it raised about $2 billion. (Reuters, November 13) And Thinking Machines Lab isn’t alone: In one of the boldest bets yet in the AI arms race, Safe Superintelligence (SSI), the stealth startup founded by former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, has raised $2 billion in a round that values the company at $32 billion – despite having no publicly released product or service. (CTech by Calcalist, April 13) What’s the end state? Part of the issue with AI includes the unusual nature of this newest thing. This isn’t like a business that designs and sells a product, making money if the selling price exceeds the cost of the inputs. Rather, it’s companies building an airplane while it’s in flight, and once it’s built, they’ll know what it can do and whether anyone will pay for its services. Many companies justify their spending because they’re not just building a product, they’re creating something that will change the world: artificial general intelligence, or A.G.I. . . . The rub is that none of them quite know how to do it. But Anton Korinek, an economist at the University of Virginia, said the spending would all be justified if Silicon Valley reached its goal. He is optimistic it can be done. “It’s a bet on A.G.I. or bust,” Dr. Korinek said. (The New York Times, November 20 – emphasis added) The yet-to-be-determined nature of the industry under construction is best captured in remarks from Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, that have been paraphrased as follows: “we’ll build this sort of generally intelligent system and then ask it to figure out a way to generate an investment return from it.” This should be a source of pause for people who heretofore fully comprehended the nature of the businesses they invested in. Clearly, the value of a technology that equals or surpasses the human brain should be pretty big, but isn’t it well beyond calculation? A Word About the Use of Debt To date, much of the investment in AI and the supporting infrastructure has consisted of equity capital derived from operating cash flow. But now, companies are committing amounts that require debt financing, and for some of those companies, the investments and leverage have to be described as aggressive. The AI data centre boom was never going to be financed with cash alone. The project is too big to be paid for out of pocket. JPMorgan analysts have done some sums on the back of a napkin, or possibly a tablecloth, and estimated the bill for the infrastructure build-out would come to $5tn (not including a tip). Who knows if that’s right, but we have good reason to expect close to half a trillion in spending next year. Meanwhile, the biggest spenders (Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Oracle) had only about $350bn in the bank, collectively, as of the end of the third quarter. (“Unhedged,” Financial Times, November 13) The firms mentioned above derive healthy cash flows from their very strong non-AI businesses. But the massive, winner-take-all arms race in AI is requiring some to take on debt. In fact, it’s reasonable to think one of the reasons they’re spending vast sums is to make it hard for lesser firms to keep up. Oracle, Meta, and Alphabet have issued 30-year bonds to finance AI investments. In the case of the latter two, the yields on the bonds exceed those on Treasurys of like maturity by 100 basis points or less. Is it prudent to accept 30 years of technological uncertainty to make a fixed-income investment that yields little more than riskless debt? And will the investments funded with debt – in chips and data centers – maintain their level of productivity long enough for these 30-year obligations to be repaid? On November 14, Alex Kantrowitz’s Big Technology Podcast carried a conversation with Gil Luria, Head of Technology Research at financial services firm D.A. Davidson, primarily regarding the use of debt in the AI sector. Here’s some of what Luria had to say: Healthy behavior is being practiced by “. . . reasonable, thoughtful business leaders, like the ones at Microsoft, Amazon, and Google that are making sound investments in growing the capacity to deliver AI. And the reason they can make sound investments is that they have all the customers. . . And so, when they make investments, they’re using cash on their balance sheets; they have tremendous cash flow to back it up; they understand that it’s a risky investment; and they balance it out.” Unhealthy behavior – Here he describes “. . . a startup that is borrowing money to build data centers for another startup. They’re both losing tremendous amounts of cash, and yet they’re somehow being able to raise this debt capital in order to fund this buildout, again without having the customers or the visibility into those investments paying off.” “So there’s a whole range of behaviors between healthy and unhealthy, and we just need to sort that out so we don’t make the mistakes of the past.” “There are certain things we finance through equity, through ownership, and there are certain things we finance through debt, through an obligation to pay down interest over time. And as a society, for the longest time, we’ve had those two pieces in their right place. Debt is when I have a predictable cash flow and/or an asset that can back that loan, and then it makes sense for me to exchange capital now for future cash flows to the lender. . . . We use equity for investing in more speculative things, for when we want to grow and we want to own that growth, but we’re not sure about what the cash flow is going to be. That’s how a normal economy functions. When you start confusing the two you get yourself in trouble.” Among potentially worrisome factors, Luria cites these: “A speculative asset . . . we don’t know how much of it we’re really going to need in two to five years.” Lender personnel with incentives to make loans but no exposure to long-term consequences The possibility that the supply of AI capacity catches up with or surpasses the demand The chance that future generations of AI chips will be more powerful, obsoleting existing ones or reducing their value as backing for debt Powerful competitors who vie for market share by cutting rental rates and running losses Here are some important paragraphs from Azeem Azhar’s Exponential View of October 18: When does an AI boom tip into a bubble? [Investor and engineer] Paul Kedrosky points to the Minsky moment – the inflection point when credit expansion exhausts its good projects and starts chasing bad ones, funding marginal deals with vendor financing and questionable coverage ratios. For AI infrastructure, that shift may already be underway; the telltale signs include hyperscalers’ capex outpacing revenue momentum and lenders sweetening terms to keep the party alive. Paul makes a compelling case. We’ve entered speculative finance territory – arguably past the tentative stage – and recent deals will set dangerous precedents. As Paul warns, this financing will “create templates for future such transactions,” spurring rapid expansion in junk issuance and SPV proliferation among hyperscalers chasing dominance at any cost. . . . For AI infrastructure, the warning signs are flashing: vendor financing proliferates, coverage ratios thin, and hyperscalers leverage balance sheets to maintain capex velocity even as revenue momentum lags. We see both sides – genuine infrastructure expansion alongside financing gymnastics that recall the 2000 telecom bust. The boom may yet prove productive, but only if revenue catches up before credit tightens. When does healthy strain become systemic risk? That’s the question we must answer before the market does. (Emphasis added) Azhar references the use of off-balance sheet financing via special-purpose vehicles, or SPVs, which were among the biggest contributors to Enron’s precariousness and eventual collapse. A company and its partners set up an SPV for some specific purpose(s) and supply the equity capital. The parent company may have operating control, but because it doesn’t have majority ownership, it doesn’t consolidate the SPV on its financial statements. The SPV takes on debt, but that debt doesn’t appear on the parent’s books. The parent may be an investment grade borrower, but likewise, the debt isn’t an obligation of the parent or guaranteed by it. Today’s debt may be backed by promised rent from a data center tenant – sometimes an equity partner – but the debt isn’t a direct obligation of the equity partner either. Essentially, an SPV is a way to make it look like a company isn’t doing the things the SPV is doing and doesn’t have the debt the SPV does. (Private equity funds and private credit funds are highly likely to be found among the partners and lenders in these entities.) As I quoted earlier, according to Perez (who wrote on the heels of the dot-com bubble), “what enabled the deployment period were the money-losing investments.” Early investment is lost in the “Minsky moment,” in which unwise commitments made in an extended up-cycle encounters value destruction in a correction. And there are three things we know for sure about the use of debt: it magnifies losses if there are losses (just as it magnifies the hoped-for gains if they materialize), it increases the probability of a venture failing if it encounters a difficult moment, and despite the layer of equity beneath it, it puts lenders’ capital at risk if the difficult moment is bad enough. One key risk to consider is the possibility that the boom in data center construction will result in a glut. Some data centers may be rendered uneconomic, and some owners may go bankrupt. In that case, a new generation of owners might buy up centers at pennies on the dollar from lenders who foreclosed on them, reaping profits when the industry stabilizes. This is a process through which “creative destruction” brings markets into equilibrium and reduces costs to levels that make future business profitable. Debt is neither a good thing nor a bad thing per se. Likewise, the use of leverage in the AI industry shouldn’t be applauded or feared. It all comes down to the proportion of debt in the capital structure; the quality of the assets or cash flows you’re lending against; the borrowers’ alternative sources of liquidity for repayment; and the adequacy of the safety margin obtained by lenders. We’ll see which lenders maintain discipline in today’s heady environment. It’s worth noting in this connection that Oaktree has made a few investments in data centers, and our parent, Brookfield, is raising a $10 billion fund for investment in AI infrastructure. Brookfield is putting up its own money and has equity commitments from sovereign wealth funds and Nvidia, to which it intends to apply “prudent” debt. Brookfield’s investments seem likely to go largely into geographies that are less saturated with data centers and for infrastructure to supply the vast amounts of electric power that data centers will require. Of course, we’re both doing these things on the basis of what we think are prudent decisions. I know I don’t know enough to opine on AI. But I do know something about debt, and it’s this: It’s okay to supply debt financing for a venture where the outcome is uncertain. It’s not okay where the outcome is purely a matter of conjecture. Those who understand the difference still have to make the distinction correctly. The FT’s Unhedged quotes Chong Sin, lead analyst for CMBS research at JPMorgan, as saying, “. . . in our conversations with investment grade ABS and CMBS investors, one often-cited concern is whether they want to take on the residual value risk of data centers when the bonds mature.” I’m glad potential lenders are asking the kind of questions they should. Here’s how to think about the intersection of debt and AI according to Bob O’Leary, Oaktree’s co-CEO and co-portfolio manager of our Opportunities Funds: Most technological advances develop into winner-takes-all or winner-takes-most competitions. The “right” way to play this dynamic is through equity, not debt. Assuming you can diversify your equity exposures so as to include the eventual winner, the massive gain from the winner will more than compensate for the capital impairment on the losers. That’s the venture capitalist’s time-honored formula for success. The precise opposite is true of a diversified pool of debt exposures. You’ll only make your coupon on the winner, and that will be grossly insufficient to compensate for the impairments you’ll experience on the debt of the losers. Of course, if you can’t identify the pool of companies from which the winner will emerge, the difference between debt and equity is irrelevant – you’re a zero either way. I mention this because that’s precisely what happened in search and social media: early leaders (Lycos in search and MySpace in social media) lost out spectacularly to companies that emerged later (Google in search and Facebook in social media). Trying to Get to a Conclusion There can be no doubt that today’s behavior is “speculative,” defined as based on speculation regarding the future. There’s also no doubt that no one knows what the future holds, but investors are betting huge sums on that future. In that connection, I want to say a little about the unique nature of AI. The AI revolution is different from the technological revolutions that preceded it in ways that are both wonderful and worrisome. It feels to me like a genie has been released from a bottle, and it isn’t going back in: AI may not be a tool for mankind, but rather something of a replacement. It may be capable of taking over cognition, on which humans have thus far had a monopoly. Because of this, it’s likely to be different in kind from prior developments, not just in degree. (More on this in my postscript.) AI technology is progressing at an incredibly rapid clip, possibly leaving scant time for mankind to adjust. I’ll provide two examples: Coding, which we called “computer programming” 60 years ago, is the canary in the coal mine in terms of the impact of AI. In many advanced software teams, developers no longer write the code; they type in what they want, and AI systems generate the code for them. Coding performed by AI is at a world-class level, something that wasn’t so just a year ago. According to my guide here, “There is no speculation about whether or not human replacement will take place in that vertical.” In the field of digital advertising, when users log into an app, AI engages in “ad matching,” showing them ads tailored to the preferences displayed by their prior surfing. No humans need apply to do this job. Perhaps most importantly, the growth of demand for AI seems totally unpredictable. As one of my younger advisers explained, “the speed and scale of improvement mean it’s incredibly hard to forecast demand for AI. Adoption today may have nothing to do with adoption tomorrow, because a year or two from now, AI may be able to do 10x or 100x what it can do today. Thus, how can anyone say how many data centers will be needed? And how can even successful companies know how much computing capacity to contract for?” With differences like these, how can anyone correctly judge what AI implies for the future? * * * One of the things occupying many observers at this juncture – including me – is the search for parallels to past bubbles. Here’s some historical perspective from a recent article in Wired: AI’s closest historical analogue here may be not electric lighting but radio. When RCA started broadcasting in 1919, it was immediately clear that it had a powerful information technology on its hands. But less clear was how that would translate into business. “Would radio be a loss-leading marketing for department stores? A public service for broadcasting Sunday sermons? An ad-supported medium for entertainment?” [Brent Goldfarb and David A. Kirsch of the University of Maryland] write. “All were possible. All were subjects of technological narratives.” As a result, radio turned into one of the biggest bubbles in history – peaking in 1929, before losing 97 percent of its value in the crash. This wasn’t an incidental sector; RCA was, along with Ford Motor Company, the most high-traded stock on the market. It was, as The New Yorker recently wrote, “the Nvidia of its day.” . . . In 1927, Charles Lindbergh flew the first solo nonstop transatlantic flight from New York to Paris. . . . It was the biggest tech demo of the day, and it became an enormous, ChatGPT-launch-level coordinating event – a signal to investors to pour money into the industry. “Expert investors appreciated correctly the importance of airplanes and air travel,” Goldfarb and Kirsch write, but “the narrative of inevitability largely drowned out their caution. Technological uncertainty was framed as opportunity, not risk. The market overestimated how quickly the industry would achieve technological viability and profitability.” As a result, the bubble burst in 1929 – from its peak in May, aviation stocks dropped 96 percent by May 1932. . . . It’s worth reiterating that two of the closest analogs AI seems to have in tech bubble history are aviation and broadcast radio. Both were wrapped in high degrees of uncertainty and both were hyped with incredibly powerful coordinating narratives. Both were seized on by pure play companies seeking to capitalize on the new game-changing tech, and both were accessible to the retail investors of the day. Both helped inflate a bubble so big that when it burst, in 1929, it left us with the Great Depression. (“AI Is the Bubble to Burst Them All,” Brian Merchant, Wired, October 27 – emphasis added. N.b., the Depression had many causes beyond the bursting of the radio/aviation bubble.) Derek Thompson, who supplied the quote with which I opened this memo, ended his newsletter with some terrific historical perspective: The railroads were a bubble and they transformed America. Electricity was a bubble, and it transformed America. The broadband build-out of the late-1990s was a bubble that transformed America. I am not rooting for a bubble, and quite the contrary, I hope that the US economy doesn’t experience another recession for many years. But given the amount of debt now flowing into AI data center construction, I think it’s unlikely that AI will be the first transformative technology that isn’t overbuilt and doesn’t incur a brief painful correction. (“AI Could Be the Railroad of the 21st Century. Brace Yourself.” November 4 – emphasis added) The skeptics readily cite ways in which today’s events are comparable to the internet bubble: A change-the-world technology Exuberant, speculative behavior The role of FOMO Suspect, circular deals The use of SPVs $1 billion seed rounds The supporters have reasons why the comparison isn’t appropriate: An existing product for which there is strong demand One billion users already (many times the number of internet users at the height of the bubble) Well-established main players with revenues, profits, and cash flow The absence of an IPO craze with prices doubling in a day Reasonable p/e ratios for the established participants I’ll elaborate regarding the first of the proposed non-comparable factors. Unlike in the internet bubble, AI products already exist at scale, the demand for them is exploding, and they’re producing revenues in rapidly increasing amounts. For example, Anthropic, one of the two leaders in producing models for AI coding as described on page 12, is said to have “10x-ed” its revenues in each of the last two years (for those who didn’t study higher math, that’s 100x in two years). Revenues from Claude Code, a program for coding that Anthropic introduced earlier this year, already are said to be running at an annual rate of $1 billion. Revenues for the other leader, Cursor, were $1 million in 2023 and $100 million in 2024, and they, too, are expected to reach $1 billion this year. As to the final bullet point, see the table below, which comes from Goldman Sachs via Derek Thompson. You’ll notice that during the internet bubble of 1998-2000, the p/e ratios were much higher for Microsoft, Cisco, and Oracle than they are today for the biggest AI players – Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta (OpenAI doesn’t have earnings). In fact, Microsoft’s on a half-off sale relative to its p/e 26 years ago! In the first bubble I witnessed – surrounding the Nifty-Fifty in 1969-72 – the p/e ratios for the leading companies were even higher than those of 1998-2000. In Conclusion For my final citation, I’ll look to Sam Altman of OpenAI. His comments seem to me to capture the essence of what’s going on: “When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,” Mr. Altman told reporters this year. “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about A.I.? My opinion is yes. Is A.I. the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes.” (The New York Times, November 20) But do I have a bottom line? Yes, I do. Alan Greenspan’s phrase, mentioned earlier, serves as an excellent way to sum up a stock market bubble: “irrational exuberance.” There is no doubt that investors are applying exuberance with regard to AI. The question is whether it’s irrational. Given the vast potential of AI but also the large number of enormous unknowns, I think virtually no one can say for sure. We can theorize about whether the current enthusiasm is excessive, but we won’t know until years from now whether it was. Bubbles are best identified in retrospect. While the parallels to past bubbles are inescapable, believers in the technology will argue that “this time it’s different.” Those four words are heard in virtually every bubble, explaining why the present situation isn’t a bubble, unlike the analogous prior ones. On the other hand, Sir John Templeton, who in 1987 drew my attention to those four words, was quick to point out that 20% of the time things really are different. But on the third hand, it must be borne in mind that behavior based on the belief that it’s different is what causes it to not be different! Today’s situation calls to mind a comment attributed to American economist Stuart Chase about faith. I believe it’s also applicable to AI (as well as to gold and cryptocurrencies): For those who believe, no proof is necessary. For those who don't believe, no proof is possible. Here’s my actual bottom line: There’s a consistent history of transformational technologies generating excessive enthusiasm and investment, resulting in more infrastructure than is needed and asset prices that prove to have been too high. The excesses accelerate the adoption of the technology in a way that wouldn’t occur in their absence. The common word for these excesses is “bubbles.” AI has the potential to be one of the greatest transformational technologies of all time. As I wrote just above, AI is currently the subject of great enthusiasm. If that enthusiasm doesn’t produce a bubble conforming to the historical pattern, that will be a first. Bubbles created in this process usually end in losses for those who fuel them. The losses stem largely from the fact that the technology’s newness renders the extent and timing of its impact unpredictable. This in turn makes it easy to judge companies too positively amid all the enthusiasm and difficult to know which will emerge as winners when the dust settles. There can be no way to participate fully in the potential benefits from the new technology without being exposed to the losses that will arise if the enthusiasm and thus investors’ behavior prove to have been excessive. The use of debt in this process – which the high level of uncertainty usually precluded in past technological revolutions – has the potential to magnify all of the above this time. Since no one can say definitively whether this is a bubble, I’d advise that no one should go all-in without acknowledging that they face the risk of ruin if things go badly. But by the same token, no one should stay all-out and risk missing out on one of the great technological steps forward. A moderate position, applied with selectivity and prudence, seems like the best approach. Finally, it’s essential to bear in mind that there are no magic words in investing. These days, people promoting real estate funds say, “Office buildings are so yesterday, but we’re investing in the future through data centers,” whereupon everyone nods in agreement. But data centers can be in shortage or in oversupply, and rental rates can surprise to the upside or the downside. As a result, they can be profitable . . . or not. Intelligent investment in data centers, and thus in AI – like everything else – requires sober, insightful judgment and skillful implementation. December 9, 2025 P.S.: The following has nothing to do with the financial markets or the question of whether AI is the subject of a bubble. My topic is the impact of AI on society through joblessness and purposelessness. You needn’t read it – that’s why it’s a postscript – but it’s important to me, and I've been looking for a place to say a few words about it. On November 18, a research note from Barclays described Fed Governor Christopher Waller as having “highlighted how recent stock market enthusiasm around AI has not yet translated into job creation.” This strikes me as paradoxical given my sense that one of AI’s main impacts will be to increase productivity and thus eliminate jobs. That is the source of my concern. I view AI primarily as an incredible labor-saving device. Joe Davis, Global Chief Economist and Global Head of the Investment Strategy Group at Vanguard, says, “for most jobs – likely four out of five – AI’s impact will result in a mixture of innovation and automation, and could save about 43% of the time people currently spend on their work tasks.” (Exponential View, September 3) I find the resulting outlook for employment terrifying. I am enormously concerned about what will happen to the people whose jobs AI renders unnecessary, or who can’t find jobs because of it. The optimists argue that “new jobs have always materialized after past technological advances.” I hope that’ll hold true in the case of AI, but hope isn’t much to hang one’s hat on, and I have trouble figuring out where those jobs will come from. Of course, I’m not much of a futurist or a financial optimist, and that’s why it’s a good thing I shifted from equities to bonds in 1978. The other thing the optimists say is that “the beneficial impact of AI on productivity will cause a huge acceleration in GDP growth.” Here I have specific quibbles: The change in GDP can be thought of as the change in hours worked times the change in output per hour (aka “productivity”). The role of AI in increasing productivity means it will take fewer hours worked – meaning fewer workers – to produce the goods we need. Or, viewed from the other direction, maybe the boom in productivity will mean a lot more goods can be produced with the same amount of labor. But if a lot of jobs are lost to AI, how will people be able to afford the additional goods AI enables to be produced? I find it hard to imagine a world in which AI works shoulder-to-shoulder with all the people who are employed today. How can employment not decline? AI is likely to replace large numbers of entry-level workers, people who process paper without applying judgment, and junior lawyers who scour the lawbooks for precedents. Maybe even junior investment analysts who create spreadsheets and compile presentation materials. It’s said that AI can read an MRI better than the average doctor. Driving is one of the most populous professions in America, and driverless vehicles are already arriving; where will all the people who currently drive taxis, limos, buses, and trucks find jobs? I imagine government’s response will be something called “universal basic income.” The government will simply mail checks to the millions for whom there are no jobs. But the worrier in me finds problems in this, too: Where will the money come from for those checks? The job losses I foresee imply reduced income tax receipts and increased spending on entitlements. This puts a further burden on the declining segment of the population that is working and implies even greater deficits ahead. In this new world, will governments be able to fund ever-increasing deficits? And more importantly, people get a lot more from jobs than just a paycheck. A job gives them a reason to get up in the morning, imparts structure to their day, gives them a productive role in society and self-respect, and presents them with challenges, the overcoming of which provides satisfaction. How will these things be replaced? I worry about large numbers of people receiving subsistence checks and sitting around idle all day. I worry about the correlation between the loss of jobs in mining and manufacturing in recent decades and the incidence of opioid addiction and shortening of lifespans. And by the way, if we eliminate large numbers of junior lawyers, analysts, and doctors, where will we get the experienced veterans capable of solving serious problems requiring judgment and pattern recognition honed over decades? What jobs won’t be eliminated? What careers should our children and grandchildren prepare for? Think about the jobs that machines can’t perform. My list starts with plumbers, electricians, and masseurs –physical tasks. Maybe nurses will earn more than doctors because they deliver hands-on care. And what distinguishes the best artists, athletes, doctors, lawyers, and hopefully investors? I think it’s something called talent or insight, which AI might or might not be able to replicate. But how many people at the top of those professions are needed? A past presidential candidate said he would give laptops to everyone who lost their job to offshoring. How many laptop operators do we need? Finally, I’m concerned that a small number of highly educated multi-billionaires living on the coasts will be viewed as having created technology that puts millions out of work. This promises even more social and political division than we have now, making the world ripe for populist demagoguery. I’ve seen incredible progress over the course of my lifetime, but in many ways I miss the simpler world I grew up in. I worry that this will be another big one. I get no pleasure from this recitation. Will the optimists please explain why I’m wrong? Interestingly in this connection, Vanguard’s Joe Davis points out that more Americans are turning 65 in 2025 than in any preceding year, and that approximately 16 million baby boomers will retire between now and 2035. Could AI merely make up for that? There’s an optimistic take for you.

Jeff Bezos’ Amazon is a one-stop shop. Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP via Getty Images Jeff Bezos’ Amazon is a one-stop shop. Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP via Getty Images Big Tech’s so-called Magnificent Seven are on everyone’s lips. The exorbitant stock market valuations of Google, Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon and Tesla provoke an amalgam of awe and fear. Their trillion-dollar investments in AI prompt some to predict the brightest of futures and others to dread humanity’s dumbing down, unemployment, redundancy even. In this overwhelming din, it is easy to miss the larger picture: a new type of capital is killing markets, capitalism’s habitat. At its very beginning, capitalism was underpinned by faith in competitive markets. In the liberal fantasy, spearheaded by Adam Smith, bakers, brewers and butchers laboured within markets so cut-throat that none could make more money than the bare minimum necessary to keep their small, family-owned businesses running. This in turn provided us with our daily bread, ale and meat. Then came the second industrial revolution and the conglomerates whose market power would make Smith weep with joy. This was the era of Big Business and the “robber barons”. And so another — neoliberal — fantasy was created, to justify the new big beasts that were now monopolising almost every market that mattered. Joseph Schumpeter, a former Austrian finance minister who made America his home, was the new creed’s most effective advocate. Progress, he argued, is impossible in competitive markets. Growth needs monopolies to fuel it. How else can enough profit be earned to pay for expensive research and development, for new machines, new product lines and all the paraphernalia that helps innovation take root? To monopolise markets, conglomerates need to dazzle us with remarkable new products that kill off the competition, like Henry Ford’s Model-T or Apple’s iPhone. Should we worry about all that concentrated power? No, Schumpeter reassured us. Once they reach their pinnacle, these monopolies get flabby and complacent and, eventually, they’re brought down by some upstart: one example being Toyota’s toppling of General Motors. More recently, Peter Thiel, Palantir’s co-founder, said something that many thought was a restatement of Schumpeter’s dictum: “Competition is for losers!” While the pioneers of Big Business like Thomas Edison and Henry Ford would have agreed wholeheartedly, what Thiel was implying went beyond their wildest imagination. It went much further even than Schumpeter’s pseudo-Darwinian idea that progress comes through the rise and fall of monopolists in an endless struggle for existence. What Thiel was saying is that today, winners do not just kill off the competition to monopolise a market. No, they keep going until they kill the market itself and replace it with something quite different: a kind of cloud fief that lacks all of the ingredients of a proper market — indeed that lacks all of the advantages that liberals and neoliberals alike recognise in the machinery of decentralised markets. In fact, today’s winners —the Magnificent Seven, plus Thiel’s own Palantir — are reviving an economic model that all of us thought dead and buried after the fall of the Soviet Union: economic planning systems that match buyers and sellers outside anything that can be usefully described as a market. By Yanis Varoufakis Gosplan was the Soviet Union’s State Planning Committee, the engine room of its command economy. Its remit was to match the supply and demand of critical resources (oil, steel, cement) but also consumption goods (food, clothes, appliances), without using market prices. Once buyers and sellers were matched, prices were assigned with a view to achieving political and social objectives (such as to ensure basic affordability, or subsidise certain industries) — not to balance markets. Gosplan was disbanded immediately after the red flag was lowered over the Kremlin on Boxing Day of 1991, but it is now back. Where? In the algorithms powering Jeff Bezos’s Amazon, Peter Thiel’s Palantir and the rest of Big Tech’s digital platforms that pretend to be, but are not, markets. Before you protest the audacity of my claim, think of what happens when you visit Amazon. Unlike when you visit a shopping mall, either with friends or mingling with strangers, the moment you follow the link to amazon.com, you exit the marketplace and enter a space of pristine isolation. It’s just you and Jeff Bezos’s algorithm. You type, say, “espresso machines” into the search box and the algorithm matches you with a number of vendors. However, to achieve what it was coded for, the algorithm had started working months, even years, earlier. Over that period, you will have revealed to it many of your whims and desires through your searches, purchases, clicks and reviews. Using these cues, as well as data from other sources, the algorithm has trained you to train it to know you even better, enabling it to advise you on what books, music and films to buy. It has already won your trust. So, now that you are in a hurry to replace your broken espresso machine, the chances are that you will choose one of the top search results it has given you. The algorithm knows your spending pattern. It knows how to guide you to the espresso machine with the highest price you are prepared to pay, all in order that Amazon can collect up to 40% of it the moment you click the purchase button. It is an extortionate cut, but the espresso machine’s makers tolerate it, because they know that if they don’t, their company will never appear in the top search results of anyone prepared to pay for their product. As AI improves, this power to manipulate your behaviour increases — and this is why Big Tech’s valuations are going through the roof. This is nothing less than a capitalist, privately-owned, super high-tech reincarnation of the USSR’s Gosplan. Amazon’s software matches you with particular vendors and bans you from talking to any seller or even from observing what other buyers are doing — unless of course it calculates that it serves its own purposes to let you see a small selection of them. As for the price you pay, this follows (rather than precipitates) your being matched with a seller. Rather than being the variable that equilibrates demand with supply, prices in Amazon fulfil another role: that of maximising Jeff Bezos’s cloud rents. In this sense, prices in Amazon and other Big Tech platforms function in a manner far closer to Gosplan than to any farmers’ market, money market or shopping mall you have ever experienced. In fact, had the Soviet leaders lived to witness the workings of Silicon Valley’s Big Tech, they would be kicking themselves, lamenting that it was American capitalists who perfected their Gosplan model, complete with a surveillance system that would make their KGB henchmen green with envy. Gosplan failed to turn into a success story as it lacked Big Tech’s greatest weapon: cloud capital, that is, the algorithms, data centres and optic fibre cables working as an integrated network to train you to train it. As you impart your data, cloud capital learns how to input desires into your mind and then satiate these desires by selling you stuff within its privately owned version of Gosplan. But, is there really a difference — I hear many of you ask loudly — between Thomas Edison and Jeff Bezos? Are they not cut from the same cloth of megalomaniac monopolists seeking to dominate markets and our imagination? Yes, despite their similarities, there is a difference — and it is gigantic. Edison’s and Ford’s capital was productive. It produced cars, electricity, turbines. Bezos’s cloud capital produces nothing, except the enormous power to encase us in his cloud fief where traditional capitalist producers are squeezed for cloud rents and we, the users, provide our free labour. With every click, like and review, we enhance the power of cloud capital. Once upon a time, an old Trotskyite told me that the Soviet Union, in the name of socialism, had created a form of industrial feudalism. Independent of whether he was right or not, his comment is pertinent today in relation to Big Tech. Come to think of it, while the trading process on platforms like Amazon is reminiscent of the USSR’s Gosplan mechanism, it is also the case that the enormous sums that Amazon, Uber, Airbnb etc, charge the actual producers of the goods and services peddled on their sites are akin to the ground rents that the landed gentry used to charge their vassals — except that, here, they are cloud rents that accrue to the owners of cloud capital. So, just as the Soviet Union generated one kind of feudalism in the name of socialism and human emancipation, today, Silicon Valley is generating another kind of feudalism — technofeudalism, I have called it — in the name of capitalism and free markets. By Joel Day The parallel extends to the state. The USSR was meant to be a workers’ paradise in contrast to the USA whose raison d’être was to be a haven for capitalist producers. It turns out that both promises were false. As Big Tech’s cloud capital accumulates and concentrates into fewer and fewer hands, states are becoming dependent on corporate techlords. By outsourcing core functions — archives, health data, even military software — to rented cloud infrastructure, governments lease back their own operational capacity from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Google. This dependency enables a new dimension of technofeudal power. From this perspective, just as the Soviet Union was a feudal-like industrial society pretending to be a workers’ state, the United States today is performing a splendid impersonation of a technofeudal state, with repercussions that extend to every realm of state activity, including health services, education, the tax office, our borders and faraway battlefields. In Ukraine and Gaza, and along our militarised borders, cloud capital is trained to extend its reach. Amazon’s AI tool Rekognition is used by law enforcement, including ICE, while Palantir’s vast surveillance software runs on Amazon’s cloud. Through Project Nimbus, Amazon and Google provide the Israeli military with advanced cloud and AI capabilities, reportedly enabling rapid, AI-driven targeting in Gaza with minimal human oversight. Let us briefly return to the comparison with the early 20th century’s original monopolist capitalists. Whether we admire or abhor the Magnificent Seven’s stock market valuations, it is helpful to keep this in mind: the old capitalist giants, the “robber barons”, actually produced things. The new technofeudal lords produce a new social order. They have replaced the invisible hand of the market with the visible, algorithmic fist of the cloudalist. Free-market enthusiasts have nothing to celebrate and much to regret. But it will take a brave soul amongst them to stare reality in the face. Just like pro-Soviet Marxists remained in denial that the Soviet experiment had failed for many years after 1991, so free-market ideologues refuse to see that capitalism begat a form of capital — cloud capital — that replaced markets with something out of the Soviet past. In the process, it has killed capitalism. Yanis Varoufakis is an economist and former Greek Minister of Finance. He is the author of several best-selling books, most recently Technofeudalism: What killed capitalism.

Title: Pay cuts, poaching, and pivoting: Inside Scale AI after Meta
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/pay-cuts-poaching-pivoting-inside-scale-ai-meta-2025-12
Time Published: 2025-12-10T09:11:01Z
Full Content:
This summer, after Meta made a $14 billion investment in Scale AI and poached its 28-year-old founder, Alexandr Wang, and after A-list clients like OpenAI and Google halted work with the startup, a worker for Scale AI anxiously asked ChatGPT what it thought of his company's fate. He knew the chatbot well, having tested it for vulnerabilities. Its prognosis was grim. "Scale AI will no longer exist as a credible independent entity within 24 months," ChatGPT, which isn't any kind of official authority, wrote. "Its infrastructure will be repurposed for Meta's internal needs. Its client base will evaporate. Its role as a neutral red teamer or external evaluator is effectively over." The contractor shared the chat logs with fellow workers at Scale AI. In one reply reviewed by Business Insider, one worker said that they were already on their way out, describing the startup as a ticking time bomb. The chatbot was drawing from a storm of headlines about Scale AI, which until this summer had been touted as one of the most ascendant startups in tech — the place Big Tech companies vying for AI supremacy went to when they wanted their chatbots stress-tested and perfected. Lately, it's lost some of its gleam, with investors significantly lowering valuations, workers sniping about pay, and rivals coming for its clientele. The vast army of human data labelers that made Scale AI a juggernaut are chafing at what they say are pay cuts, lengthy unpaid onboarding sessions to join new AI projects, and thinning workloads — and are increasingly leaving the platform altogether, according to interviews with five current and former contractors and internal correspondence obtained by Business Insider. Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. Activity in the main internal chatroom for Outlier — Scale AI's flagship gig work platform, which touts more than 100,000 taskers — has plummeted since the Meta investment, with weekly discussion threads drawing dozens instead of the usual hundreds of replies, according to screenshots reviewed by Business Insider. One tasker said that they'd spent close to 40 hours in a single month in unpaid onboarding sessions without landing any actual work, noting that other platforms like Scale AI's rival Mercor do pay for this kind of work. Elizabeth Boyd, another tasker, says she rarely does work for Outlier anymore after seeing effective pay rates for some projects slashed to around $20 an hour — down from the $50 she used to make. One gig that advertised $20 an hour only allowed three minutes of working time every two days, or a 99-cent payout, according to screenshots obtained by Business Insider. Joe Osborne, a Scale AI spokesperson, says the balance sheets show the company is on the right path. "This quarter is on track to be our biggest of 2025, our data business is more profitable today than it was before the Meta deal, and our applications business, which includes work with Fortune 500 companies and governments, has doubled revenue" in the second half of the year compared to the first, Osborne wrote in an email. He also noted there has been an increase in active users on Outlier since the Meta deal, and that pay rates are based on the skills for each project and contributors always see the rates upfront, and have the option of declining any gig. The company is also looking to diversify. The startup has embraced fields like robotics, announcing a new lab to meet booming demand for robot training data this fall. It's doubling down on its US military and other government work, winning up to $199 million worth of defense contracts since the Meta deal. Some investors are bullish. In one current investor's view, Meta has mostly left Scale alone, letting it operate as an independent company. With around $1 billion on the balance sheet, the investor added, there are no plans to fundraise. And an IPO could still be on the table at some point. Other investors see Scale AI as more like a gutted fish. The Meta investment — which valued Scale AI at $29 billion — has dented Scale AI's valuation in private markets where people buy and sell equity from pre-IPO startups. Noel Moldvai, Augment's CEO, tells Business Insider his platform used to process millions of dollars' worth of transactions in Scale AI stock before the Meta deal, but that dried up as sellers waited to see if the startup rebounded. Activity is picking up again, he said, but at lower valuations of around $15 billion to $9 billion. The underlying message of Meta's semi-acquisition is clear to Moldvai. "It seems like Meta was just after Alexandr Wang, and so this is probably the structure that let them get him," he says. He adds that Scale AI's valuation could still bounce back. On another marketplace, Caplight, Scale's valuation has dropped to $7.3 billion. Osborne says that the valuation is not accurate because there have been no sales of stock at that price and multiples of comparable companies would yield a higher valuation. If the company doesn't pull it off, it could become the latest example of a once-promising startup that morphed into a "zombie" after being invested in by a tech giant. This summer, Scale AI painted a rosy picture of the Meta investment, describing it as a major cash infusion and source of future work in its official statement at the time of the deal. That messaging was also conveyed to the startup's corporate workforce, says another former member of Scale AI's red team, which tests chatbots for flaws and vulnerabilities. Just a few weeks after the investment, he was laid off as part of a major downsizing that saw 14% of Scale AI's full-time staff of 1,400 let go. Osborne said the layoffs were aimed at making the data division profitable, which it now is. Those weren't the only cuts. In September, Scale AI terminated 12 contractors on its red team, citing performance issues. Two ex-red teamers told Business Insider that the team's work had been drying up since the Meta deal, blaming thinning workloads for the cuts. Later that month, Scale AI shuttered a team in Dallas of contractors focused on generalist AI work as it moved towards more specialized fields. Osborne said the 12 contractors were part of Scale's temporary workforce and represented a small fraction of its overall red team, which the company is still committed to investing in. He said the Dallas cuts were part of an industry shift towards higher skilled work and represent a small fraction of its overall workforce. Meanwhile, a swarm of AI training startups has rushed in to poach Scale AI's workers and clients. Some are now raising capital at soaring valuations. Surge AI hit a valuation of $24 billion while Mercor, which is run by three 22-year-olds, announced in October it had raised $350 million at a $10 billion valuation. Mercor has won at least one major AI training project from Meta, Scale AI's 49% shareholder. In September, Scale AI filed a lawsuit in California against Mercor alleging it hired one of its sales employees to poach its biggest customers, allegations Mercor denies. One Scale AI investor said he'd been frustrated with Scale AI's leadership losing customers to Surge AI in particular, which reportedly brought in more revenue than Scale in 2024, despite never having raised outside funding. (Scale AI had raised more than $1.5 billion before the Meta deal.) Brendan Foody, Mercor's CEO, has publicly criticized Scale AI for what he claims are low pay rates and data quality issues. "Scale lost the focus on product, on scaling quality," Foody said in a September podcast appearance. In response, a Scale AI spokesperson told Business Insider its quality metrics are at "record highs." It's not just rival CEOs making that point. Tammy Hartline, who managed projects for Scale AI as a consultant until the summer of 2025, said Scale grew so quickly that the work became more about needing bodies than skills. "Spam and low quality data became accepted as a cost of doing business," she said. Hartline joined Mercor in September. Scale AI has also been beset with security issues that predate Meta's investment. In June, Business Insider reported that Scale AI routinely used public Google Docs to track work for high-profile customers, including Google, Meta, and xAI. That practice left AI training documents labeled "confidential" accessible to anyone with the link and exposed reams of personal information, like private emails and pay details, about contractors. "We take data security seriously," Osborne said. "We conducted a thorough investigation and disabled any user's ability to publicly share documents from Scale managed systems." Sloppy security isn't uncommon in the AI training space — Surge AI similarly left open sensitive work for its client Anthropic. But the exposed documents seen by Business Insider show that for a project for Google, Scale AI faced security and quality issues throughout 2023 and 2024. Thousands of taskers were flagged for being "suspected spammers," "cheaters," with hundreds of workers listed in spreadsheets with titles like "Good and Bad Folks" and "suspicious non-US taskers." Meta recently removed more than 40 groups buying and reselling AI training accounts, including from Scale AI, in response to a recent Business Insider investigation. Osborne said Scale's data quality metrics are the highest they've ever been. The company has notched some recent wins. It once appeared bogged down by litigation, but recently agreed to settle multiple lawsuits filed by ex-workers in California who alleged they were underpaid and misclassified as contractors. (Scale no longer accepts gig workers from the state.) The big question remains whether Scale AI can thrive in the increasingly competitive AI training industry it helped give birth to. For many former workers, it'll be too late to find out. Charles Rollet is Business Insider's tech correspondent in San Francisco.

Title: Investors Brace for Revelations in New AI Bellwether Oracle’s Latest Report

Deals with Meta, Nvidia and Softbank underscore concerns that Oracle is overexposed to a possible AI bubble. Sean Craig sean.craig@thedailyupside.com When tech giant Oracle, a linchpin of the artificial intelligence boom, reports quarterly earnings today, investors expect it to live up to its name — which in antiquity referred to a medium providing insight into the unknown. The unknown being where AI, an increasingly agita-prone trade, is heading in 2026. For decades following its 1977 founding, Oracle was known for enterprise software: In a 1993 cover story, Fortune dubbed chairman Larry Ellison “software’s other billionaire” after Microsoft’s Bill Gates, featuring him in a full-cut suit with peak lapels that screamed industry titan of the late 20th century. This year, Oracle vaulted to the forefront of the new century by pivoting to data centers and cloud infrastructure to support the artificial intelligence boom. Its share price, up 33% in 2025, made Ellison the world’s wealthiest man for a brief stint. But a certain calculus worries some investors. In September, Oracle announced a $300 billion deal with OpenAI that would see the ChatGPT-maker buy computing power over five years starting in 2027. Building out the capacity to provide that power, however, requires piling up more debt than can fit in a full-cut early ’90s power suit. After the deal was announced, Oracle raised $18 billion from a bond sale and now carries over $100 billion in debt. Deals with Meta, Nvidia and Softbank underscore concerns that Oracle is overexposed to the AI bubble. Those worries have manifested in two ways. First, as of Tuesday’s close, Oracle’s share price is down 32% from its record September high. Second, options traders piled into the company’s credit-default swaps in recent months as the price to guard against Oracle defaulting on its debt tripled (no one expects that to happen, but if AI bubble fears push the swaps up more, those traders could profit). Which sets the stage for today’s earnings, now considered a test of the market’s confidence in the AI trade. Many analysts think the worst fears are overblown: An Assist from Altman: Evercore advised investors to exercise “some patience as turning sentiment will take time,” adding that OpenAI could lend a helping hand if, as expected, it soon puts out an updated version of its chatbot that rivals or surpasses Google’s latest Gemini release. Some user-generated Sora videos will also make their way onto Disney+, and ChatGPT will become available to Disney employees. SpaceX’s potential monster IPO would come after what’s been a remarkable rebound year for public listings. Morgan Stanley cut its rating of Tesla for the first time in two years on Monday to “equal weight,” which is equivalent to a hold. A handful of high-profile defamation-by-AI-chatbot allegations against big tech firms are already stacking up. You might recall that in 2021, Zuckerberg deemed the metaverse so vital to the future he renamed the entire company after it. In memo this week, Altman promised the release of a new reasoning model next week that bests Google’s Gemini. Anduril was last valued at $30 billion in June, when its $2.5 billion fundraising round was oversubscribed eight times. The success of indie titles may help video game makers rely less on blockbusters and widen creative license, creating a 1UP for players. Artificial intelligence can do a lot of things. Getting us on an exercise bike doesn’t appear to be one of them. Gemini was trained on Google’s in-house chips, which look like a cheaper and more efficient alternative to Nvidia’s cutting-edge products. Wall Street’s smart money is starting to take out some short positions on the AI trade, albeit mostly around the industry’s fringes. Digital asset treasury companies are grappling with the law of diminishing returns in the midst of a cryptocurrency swoon. What’s next? © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Coreweave CEO defends AI circular deals as 'working together' | TechCrunch

In March, the AI cloud infrastructure provider went public in one of the biggest and most anticipated IPOs of the year that didn’t live up to its hype. Another setback took place in October, when a planned acquisition of the cloud provider’s business partner, Core Scientific, faltered due to skepticism from the acquisition target’s shareholders. In the meantime, the firm has acquired a number of different companies, its stock has gone up and down, and it’s been both criticized and lauded for its role in the booming AI data center market. In an interview at the Fortune Brainstorm AI summit in San Francisco on Tuesday, CoreWeave’s co-founder and CEO, Michael Intrator, defended his company’s performance from critics, noting that it was in the midst of creating a “new business model” for how cloud computing can be built and run. Their collection of Nvidia GPUs is so valuable, they borrow against it to help finance their business. The executive seemed to imply: If you’re charting a new path, you’re destined to encounter some road bumps along the way. “I think people are myopic a lot of times,” Intrator said when questioned about his company’s occasionally unstable stock price. “Yes, it is seesawing,” he admitted, while noting that the CoreWeave IPO took place not long before President Trump’s tariffs went into effect — a notably uncertain moment for the overall economy. “We came out into one of the most challenging environments, right around Liberation Day and, in spite of the incredible headwinds, were able to launch a successful IPO,” the CEO told Brainstorm editorial director Andrew Nusca. “I couldn’t be prouder of what the company has accomplished,” he added. CoreWeave’s stock may have debuted amid the economic doldrums of March but its price has gone on quite the journey since then. It debuted at $40 and, over the past eight months, has climbed to well over $150, but currently rests at around $90. Its more wary critics have compared it to a meme stock due to its penchant for going up and down. Some of the uncertainty around CoreWeave’s stock has been credited to the company’s hefty level of debt. Not long after CoreWeave announced a deal on Monday to issue even more debt to finance its data center buildout, its stock dropped some 8%. Intrator seems to see his company as a disruptor, one whose unconventional tactics may take some getting used to. “When you introduce a new model, when you introduce a new way of doing business, when you disrupt what has been a static environment, it’s going to take some people some time,” he said during his appearance Tuesday. CoreWeave actually started its corporate life as a crypto miner but in short order built itself into a pivotal provider of “AI infrastructure” to some of the tech industry’s most major players. In that role, it provides GPUs to AI developers and has made major partnerships with Microsoft, OpenAI, Nvidia, Meta, and other tech titans. Another topic broached Tuesday was the notion of “circularity” within the AI industry. “Circular” business deals, in which a small number of powerful AI companies invest in one another, have frequently been criticized and have raised questions about the industry’s long-term economic stability. Perhaps not surprisingly, since Nvidia is one of its investors and its supplier of GPUs, Intrator swatted away such concerns. “Companies are trying to address a violent change in supply and demand,” he said. “You do that by working together.” Since the IPO, CoreWeave has continued to make efforts to expand its business. After it acquired Weights & Biases, an AI developer platform, in March, it went on to acquire OpenPipe, a startup that helps companies create and deploy AI agents through reinforcement learning. In October, it also made deals to acquire Marimo (the creator of an open source notebook) and Monolith, another AI company. It also recently announced an expansion of its cloud partnership with OpenAI and said it has plans to move into the federal market, where it wants to provide cloud infrastructure to U.S. government agencies and the defense industrial base.

Title: CoreWeave CEO: Despite see-sawing stock, IPO was ‘incredibly successful’ after challenges of Liberation Day tariff timing

CoreWeave has been rocked by dizzying stock swings—with its shares currently trading 52% below their post-IPO high—and it’s a frequent target of market commentators, but CEO Michael Intrator says the company’s move to the public markets has been “incredibly successful.” And he takes the public’s mixed reaction in stride, given the novelty of CoreWeave’s “neocloud” business, which competes with established cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud. “When you introduce new models, introduce a new way of doing business, disrupt what has been a static environment, it’s going to take some people some time,” Intrator said Tuesday at the Fortune Brainstorm AI conference in San Francisco. But, he added, more people are beginning to understand the CoreWeave business model. “We came out into one of the most challenging environments,” Intrator said of CoreWeave’s March IPO, which occurred very close to President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs in April. “In spite of the incredible headwinds, [we were] able to launch a successful IPO.” CoreWeave, which priced its IPO at $40 per share, has experienced frequent severe up-and-down price swings in the eight months since its public market debut. At its closing price of $90.66 on Tuesday, the stock remains well above its IPO price. As Fortune reported last month, CoreWeave’s rapid rise has been fueled by an aggressive, debt-heavy strategy to stand up data centers at unprecedented speed for AI customers. And for now, the bet is still paying off. In its third-quarter results released in November, the company said its revenue backlog nearly doubled in a single quarter—to $55.6 billion from $30 billion—reflecting long-term commitments from marquee clients including Meta and OpenAI, as well as French AI startup Poolside. Both earnings and revenue came in ahead of Wall Street expectations. But the numbers were not all celebratory. CoreWeave disclosed a further increase in the debt it has taken on to finance its expansion, and it revised its full-year revenue outlook downward—even with historic demand in the pipeline. With media headlines calling CoreWeave a “ticking time bomb,” and critics calling out insider stock sales, circular financing accusations, and an overreliance on Nvidia, Intrator was asked whether he felt CoreWeave was misunderstood. “Look, we built a company that is challenging one of the most stable businesses that exist—that cloud business, these three massive players,” he said, referring to AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. I feel like it’s incumbent on CoreWeave to introduce a new business model on how the cloud is going to be built and run. And that’s what we’re doing.” He repeatedly framed CoreWeave not as a GPU reseller or traditional data-center operator but as a company purpose-built from scratch to deliver high-performance, parallelized computing for AI workloads. That focus, he said, means designing proprietary software that orchestrates GPUs, building and colocating its own infrastructure, and moving “up the stack” through acquisitions such as Weights & Biases and OpenPipe. Intrator also defended the company’s debt strategy, saying CoreWeave is effectively inventing a new financing model for AI infrastructure. He pointed to the company’s ability to repurpose power sources, rapidly deploy capacity, and finance large-scale clusters as proof it is solving problems incumbents never had to face. “When I look back at the history of the company, it took us a year with a company investor like Fidelity, before they were like, ‘Oh, I get it,’” he said. “So look, we’ve been public for eight months. I couldn’t be prouder of what the company has accomplished.”

Title: Updates from Two Big Tech Firms Land This Week. What It Could Mean for the AI Trade

Two tech giants shocked Wall Street with their earnings reports in September. Now they're under pressure to do it again. Software giant Oracle (ORCL) will report quarterly results after the market closes on Wednesday, followed by semiconductor firm Broadcom (AVGO) on Thursday afternoon. Their shares are up 33% and 75%, respectively, since the beginning of the year—but the stocks have diverged in recent months, reflecting the anxieties driving a shift in the AI investor debate. Wall Street is generally optimistic about both Oracle's and Broadcom's upcoming earnings reports. Analysts expect both companies, among the biggest in the S&P 500, to show signs that AI demand will remain strong into next year. But recent Goldman Sachs research suggests that sector stocks may not all be pulled higher by industry-level forces in the months ahead. In recent months, investors have grown increasingly wary of the AI investments that have fueled stock market gains for years. Oracle and Broadcom's earnings will offer investors evidence of AI demand from two perspectives, that of the AI chip supplier and that of the buyer. Oracle in early September supplanted Nvidia as the hottest AI play on Wall Street. The stock skyrocketed 36% the day after Oracle said its cloud computing backlog more than quadrupled to nearly $500 billion. Wall Street lauded the results, calling them evidence of a “truly historic” quarter that confirmed “a seismic shift happening in computing.” But then reports indicated that nearly all of Oracle’s backlog growth spawned from a $300 billion, multi-year deal with OpenAI, the ChatGPT-maker that is expected to burn through more than $100 billion before turning a profit at the end of the decade. That raised concerns that too many of Oracle’s eggs were in one big, risky basket. Meanwhile, the debate on Wall Street about whether cloud providers like Oracle are overspending on infrastructure intensified. Oracle sold $18 billion of bonds in September to help finance its data center investments, drawing attention to the fact that its debt burden is higher and its credit rating is lower than companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META). Oracle’s stock languished amid concerns about customer concentration and an AI bubble. Shares are down more than 30% in the past three months, a drop that’s erased all of the stock’s post-earning gains in September. Semiconductor and networking equipment provider Broadcom, meanwhile, is among the best-performing tech stocks in recent months, boosted by optimism that it is chipping away at Nvidia’s (NVDA) dominance in the AI chip market. Broadcom jumped nearly 10% after its September earnings report, when executives revealed they had secured a $10 billion order for custom chips from a new customer. As with Oracle, reports in the following days suggested the undisclosed customer was OpenAI. But unlike Oracle, Wall Street has only grown more bullish on Broadcom’s AI business—mostly because of the mid-November launch of Google’s Gemini 3, the tech giant’s first AI model to be trained exclusively with Broadcom-designed custom chips. Silicon Valley and Wall Street insiders alike raved about the model, prompting OpenAI to reportedly refocus on improving ChatGPT to fend off stiff competition. Google has reportedly discussed selling its custom chips to Meta, further boosting confidence that Broadcom can take market share from Nvidia. Broadcom shares have risen nearly 20% since Google launched Gemini, outperforming both the S&P 500, up 4%, and the Magnificent Seven, up 6%. Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent note analyzed the assumptions underpinning Wall Street's forecast for Oracle's business and stock. "The company is getting little if any credit for its business with OpenAI at the current share price of ~$200," they wrote. Analysts at Citi expect Oracle to report its backlog grew $100 billion last quarter, offering "more evidence that AI infrastructure demand is broad-based." Bank of America earlier this month raised its price target on Broadcom stock, citing an improved outlook for Google's custom chips. HSBC analyst Frank Lee forecast Broadcom's results Thursday would meet expectations before custom chip and networking demand accelerate the companies' AI business early next year. It may, however, no longer be the case that a rising AI tide lifts all boats. According to a Goldman Sachs report, the correlation between AI hyperscaler stocks was about 20% in mid-November, down from 80% in June. Update—December 9, 2025: This article was updated after markets closed on Tuesday with the latest stock performance data.
