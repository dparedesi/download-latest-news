Title: All Investor Eyes On Amazon: Earnings Out Today And Tariffs Are ‘Biggest Focus’

Amazon delivered results from 2025’s first three months Thursday afternoon—adding to a blockbuster week that included a short-lived standoff between the company and White House—as investors pay keen attention to how the e-commerce giant will comment on how President Trump’s tariffs will impact its business. The White House took significant issue with Amazon’s rumored plans to highlight tariff-related price ... More increases this week. Amazon brought in $155.7 billion in revenue and $1.59 earnings per share ($17.1 billion net income), beating consensus analyst estimates of $155.1 billion in revenue and $1.37 earnings per share ($14.6 billion net income), according to FactSet data. But the Seattle-based firm said it expects the second quarter won’t live up to what Wall Street expected. Amazon guided for $159 billion to $164 billion in Q2 sales ($161.5 billion midpoint) and between $13 billion and $17.5 billion in Q2 operating income ($15.3 billion midpoint), comparing unfavorably to estimates of $161.2 billion in sales and $17.6 billion operating profit for Amazon’s current quarter. Shares of Amazon declined more than 2% in after-hours trading on the weaker-than-expected outlook for the current quarter. Amazon’s artificial intelligence heavy AWS cloud segment booked annual sales growth of 17% to $29.3 billion, roughly in line with forecasts of $29.4 billion. Amazon said "tariff and trade policy" changes were among the complicating factors in issuing guidance, a reference that was not in the previous quarter's outlook. About half of Amazon’s third-party sellers are from China, according to Marketplace Pulse. Many major U.S. companies are warning investors in their earnings reports about the impact tariffs will have. Shares of Amazon climbed 3% on Thursday to $190, closing at their highest level in three weeks. The rally came as the Nasdaq spiked 1.5% following strong earnings reports from Facebook parent Meta and Microsoft. Amazon will hold its earnings call with investors at 5 p.m., livestreamed here. The “biggest focus” for the call will be how Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and management address tariffs, according to Bank of America analyst Justin Post. Amazon and Apple are among the U.S. companies with the heaviest exposure to China tariffs. Both of their stocks have underperformed many of their peers accordingly, as Amazon’s -14% year-to-date return and Apple’s -15% return is worse than the S&P 500’s -5%. Amazon briefly became the target of the Trump administration’s ire Tuesday when White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt deemed the retailer’s reported plans to directly display tariff price increases to consumers a “hostile and political act.” Amazon spokesperson Tim Doyle told Forbes the company only mulled adding those tariff items to its low-price Haul site, but it was “never approved and not going to happen.” Trump called Amazon chairman Jeff Bezos to voice his displeasure with highlighting any tariff price increases. Bezos is a “good guy” and “solved the problem very quickly,” Trump told reporters Tuesday. Bezos is the second-wealthiest person in the world thanks mostly to his 9% stake in Amazon, according to Forbes’ estimates. His $208 billion net worth trails only the $387 billion fortune of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Correction (5/1): Amazon’s Q1 revenue and AWS year-over-year growth were updated. One Community. Many Voices.

May 01, 2025 11:33 ET | Source: Berger Montague Berger Montague PHILADELPHIA, May 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Berger Montague PC advises investors that a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) on behalf of purchasers of AppLovin securities between May 10, 2023 through March 26, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investor Deadline: Investors who purchased or acquired AppLovin securities during the Class Period may, no later than MAY 5, 2025, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. To learn your rights, CLICK HERE. Headquartered in Palo Alto, Calif., AppLovin is a developer of a software-based platform for advertisers. According to the complaint, AppLovin and senior management misled investors regarding AppLovin’s financial growth and stability, raising expectations as to the launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and the use of “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games. The truth began to emerge on February 26, 2025, when analysts Fuzzy Panda and Culper Research each published reports accusing AppLovin of, among other things, reverse-engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged that AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, thus presenting false installation numbers and profits. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025 – a decline of $46.06 per share, or 12%. Then, on March 26, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a report alleging numerous issues with the Company, including that AppLovin used proprietary third-party data in a manner that violated the terms of service of Facebook, Google, Snap, Reddit, as well as other platforms, potentially leading to backlash and service blocking and threatening the sustainability of AppLovin’s revenue growth. On this news, the Company’s stock fell $65.92 per share, or 20%, from a close of $327.62 per share on March 26, 2025 to a close of $261.70 per share on March 27, 2025.

Title: McDonald's has a warning about the economy

McDonald’s stock price declined more than 1% on Thursday on disappointing first-quarter results, as broad economic pressures weighed on customers and kept them away. The iconic chain’s U.S. same-store sales dropped 3.6% — a rare miss uncomfortably recalling a similar drop during the 2020 pandemic. Global comparable sales slipped 1%. Total revenue declined 3% to $5.96 billion, while earnings dipped 2% to $2.60 per share. “Consumers today are grappling with uncertainty,” said CEO Chris Kempczinski in the earnings release, calling out macro pressures as guest counts underwhelmed – i.e., as customers skipped their Big Macs and fries. Management was careful to note that the absence of Leap Day distorted year-over-year comparisons, because when you’re the size of McDonald’s, even one fewer sales day per year makes a difference. But the broader story was one of anxious consumers. International results were uneven. Japan and the Middle East helped McDonald’s licensed markets grow 3.5%, but U.K. consumers seemed particularly cautious, dragging down company-operated regions. It wasn’t all bad news, however. One bright spot was McDonald’s digital loyalty program, which drove $8 billion in systemwide sales this quarter and more than $31 billion over the past year — proof that customer engagement remains strong, even as wallets tighten. Those app-based deals for $1.29 any-size fries and 20% off orders over $12 are simply hard to ignore, and become all the more compelling as wallets tighten. McDonald’s joins a growing list of consumer-facing brands flashing warning signs. Harley-Davidson (HOG) yanked its full-year guidance Thursday, citing tariff fears. Starbucks (SBUX) saw shrinking margins and slowing traffic. Sysco (SYY), the largest restaurant supplier in the U.S. and UK, also missed, suggesting a burgeoning restaurant recession cutting across both the higher and lower ends of the markets. Consumer confidence just saw its sharpest drop in years. Meanwhile on Thursday, Wall Street – a part of it, anyway — is roaring. Big Tech earnings from Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) have powered the Nasdaq higher, with Microsoft up 9% and Meta gaining over 6%. As investors chase AI growth and bet on hyper-scaling, the disconnect between Wall Street and Main Street looks to be growing starker. And for companies relying on middle- and lower-income, discretionary spending, the squeeze is here — and it’s showing up in the numbers. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Microsoft and Meta just revived the stock market's AI trade

The Nasdaq has recovered all of the losses sparked by President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcement on April 2. The Nasdaq 100 plunged as much as 15% since the sky-high tariff announcement, but has since surged as much as 20% as the Trump administration rescinded some of the tariffs and instituted a 90-day pause. Solid earnings results from Microsoft and Meta Platforms helped boost tech stocks even higher on Thursday. During their earnings calls, both companies hyped up AI tech and committed to making massive investments in AI infrastructure. Shares of AI-related stocks boomed Thursday morning, with Nvidia up as much as 5%, and other names including Arista Networks, Vistra, CoreWeave, and Vertiv also surging. The jump in tech shares helped indexes rally after a mixed day on Wednesday, following a slate of weak economic data. Here's where major US indexes stood at about 11:10 a.m. ET: Meta raised capex guidance for 2025 to $64 billion to $72 billion from $60 billion to $65 billion, though higher costs due to tariffs could be playing a role in the increased guidance. The jump in capex plans suggests that the AI infrastructure buildout isn't slowing down as had been feared in recent months following the release of the highly efficient DeepSeek model from a startup in China. "We expect this significant infrastructure footprint we are building will not only help us meet the demands of our business in the near term, but also provide us an advantage in the quality and scale of AI services we can deliver," Meta Platforms CFO Susan Li said on the company's earnings call. Wall Street analysts cheered the results. Bank of America reiterated its "Buy" rating for the stock on Thursday and raised its price target to $690 per share, a potential jump of 16% from Thursday's intraday high. Meanwhile, Microsoft spent the bulk of its earnings call talking about the importance of AI and how it's helping grow its business across the cloud and enterprise software. "Cloud and AI are the essential inputs for every business to expand output, reduce costs, and accelerate growth," Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said. Microsoft's Azure cloud business posted year-over-year revenue growth of 33%, of which about 16% was attributed to AI. "The company is still doubling down on the AI monetization strategy within cloud," Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note after Microsoft's earnings. Microsoft reiterated its guidance to spend $80 billion in capital expenditures this year. Jump to

Good morning. President Donald Trump held a rally this week in Macomb County, Michigan, to mark his first 100 days in office. BI had a reporter in attendance. The key issue for rallygoers they spoke with was, surprisingly, not the economy. Read the full story. In today's newsletter, it's a crucial week for Big Tech. We're breaking down the key details from Meta's and Microsoft's earnings reports — and looking ahead to what Wall Street will be watching for when Apple and Amazon report today. Exciting news: Tech Memo, a weekly BI newsletter from Alistair Barr, is launching soon. Get the scoop on what's happening inside the world's most powerful tech companies — sign up here! What's on deck Markets: Despite the S&P 500's recent rally, Wall Street forecasters see more pain ahead. Tech: Meta, Microsoft, and Google are leading a performance management vibe shift. Business: Why you can expect to see more professionally produced videos on your LinkedIn feed. But first, a moment of truth. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. It's a big week for Big Tech. On Wednesday, Meta and Microsoft reported earnings. Today, it's Apple's and Amazon's turn. The backdrop is grim: a global trade war, the looming threat of stagflation, and falling consumer sentiment. Despite these mounting challenges, this earnings season may hold the keys to a potential stock rally. As of writing, US futures are up following Microsoft's and Meta's reports. Let's kick things off there. The Ms Meta. Another win. Its $42.3 billion in revenue and $6.43 EPS smashed forecasts. Meta shares are up around 6% premarket. CEO Mark Zuckerberg was as bullish as ever on the company's AI plans, with Meta raising its spending estimates for the year. Meanwhile, the company's Reality Labs division lost around $4 billion, again. As BI's Pranav Dixit writes, recent layoffs could signal the beginning of the end for Reality Labs. Up next, Apple and Amazon report earnings after the bell. The As 1. Meet BI's Investor of the Month. David Miller, manager of the Strategy Shares Gold Enhanced Yield ETF, has had a good few months, as investors turn to the safe-haven asset during volatility. His fund has stood out, up 23% this year and 37% over the past 12 months. 2. Investors aren't out of the woods yet. Stocks may have recovered from a historic sell-off in April, but Wall Street pros warn the market could be headed for more pain. They shared three warning signs they see on the horizon. 3. Inside a top stock-picker's investing process. Steve Schurr was central to the equities rebuild at Balyasny, and he was recently poached by Millennium with a $100 million pay package. Here's a look at how he picks investments, according to a presentation recording viewed by BI. 1. Carrots and sticks. No more cushy perks and low accountability: Companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Google are adopting high rewards (carrots) and steep consequences (sticks) for performance management. It reflects an industry shift toward leaner and more intense workplaces. 2. Elon Musk's staying put at Tesla. That's according to the company's chair Robyn Denholm, who denied that the Tesla's board had considered replacing Musk as CEO, in a post on Tesla's X account on Wednesday. 3. Shopify sunsets its revenue share exemption. App developers aren't happy about the policy change and said it would force them to re-evaluate their budgets for 2026. It's bad timing as merchants are already looking to cut costs amid tariffs. 1. CEOs are being grilled on tariff impacts. Here's what CEOs of major companies have said about the trade war's effects on their businesses — and consumers' wallets. Trump's recent rebuke of Amazon means some retailers are likely proceeding with caution, retail experts told BI. 2. Bank of New York Mellon Corp. calls for four days in the office. The memo sent to staff, a copy of which was obtained by BI, said there were "no plans" for employees to return the full five days. It's the latest bank to rein in remote work. 3. LinkedIn wants a bigger slice of the creator economy. The professional networking site said it's planning to launch five new shows from business-oriented creators, including podcast host Steven Bartlett and fashion designer Rebecca Minkoff. Apple, Amazon, McDonald's, Reddit, and Airbnb report earnings. The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York (on parental leave).

Tech stocks roared on Thursday, lifting the Nasdaq 1.2%, with the S&P 500 rising 0.6% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 83 points by market close. Amazon’s after-the-bell earnings release showed a handy beat of analyst estimates as the e-commerce giant posted earnings of $1.59 per share, smashing Street estimates of $1.37. Net sales grew 9% to $155.7 billion and AWS segment sales grew 17% to $29.3 billion. Whether Wall Street loves the results is still up in the air, however, with Amazon stock slipping 2% after hours. Perhaps Microsoft’s cloud and AI-related growth set the bar too high. Earlier on Thursday, Mastercard (MA) reported a solid first quarter, with net revenue climbing 14% year-over-year to $7.3 billion, or 17% on a currency-neutral basis, and adjusted earnings per share rising 13% to $3.73. Growth was driven by strong cross-border volume, which climbed 15%, and gross dollar volume and switched transactions, both up 9%. CEO Michael Miebach highlighted strategic partnerships with Microsoft and OpenAI, calling the company’s business model “diversified and resilient” despite macro uncertainty. In addition to Amazon results after the bell, investor were also waiting for results from Apple and Airbnb (ABNB). U.S. markets rose Thursday morning, lifted by blockbuster earnings from Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) that seemed strong enough to overshadow Wednesday’s unexpected GDP contraction. With Big Tech’s collective market cap nearing $10 trillion, investor sentiment looked ready to ride the rally — if Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) can stick the landing after Thursday’s close. Unsurprisingly, the Nasdaq was leading the charge, up 1.8%. The S&P was up under 0.8%, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 0.3%. Delivering their latest quarterlies after Wednesday’s bell, Microsoft and Meta both crushed expectations. Microsoft’s Azure cloud revenue surged 33% year-over-year, driving an 18% jump in earnings per share. Meta posted a staggering 89% profit increase on 27% revenue growth. Microsoft stock was up 9% before the bell Thursday. Shares of Meta added more than 6%. The underlying strength of both reports has markets betting that Amazon, as another “hyperscaler” helping bigwig enterprise customers get in on the AI revolution, will keep the momentum going. Apple, with its different mix of exposure to consumer spending, tariffs, and trade winds, was down about 1.5%. Microsoft’s quarter drew gushing praise from analysts both on and off the earnings call, with Wedbush calling it “an Aaron Judge-like performance” (referring to the New York Yankees slugger). Azure beat both the Street and internal targets, with AI workloads accounting for nearly half the cloud platform’s growth. The company reaffirmed its $80 billion FY25 capital expenditures forecast and said infrastructure investments will continue to rise in FY26 — putting to rest speculation about data center cutbacks. Wedbush raised its price target from $475 to $515. Meta stock jumped after hours as the company reported EPS of $6.43 on revenue of $42.3 billion, beating estimates on both the top and bottom lines. “While many companies have held back guidance amid tariff uncertainty, META did — a bullish sign,” Zacks strategist Andrew Rocco said. The company’s Q2 revenue forecast of $42.5 to $45.5 billion topped Street estimates, and planned 2025 capital expenditures of $64-$72 billion suggest Meta is betting big on sustained AI demand. Even after the Senate narrowly rejected a bipartisan push to block Trump’s new tariffs, trade tensions remain unresolved. U.S. Trade Representative Sarah Bianchi Greer said there are “no official talks yet” with China — though smaller deals with other nations may materialize in the coming weeks. The continuing ambiguity continues to haunt earnings calls and cloud forward guidance, and both Amazon and Apple will likely have to mention the elephant as they report later today. McDonald’s missed earnings expectations as global sales fell, revenue declined, and U.S. same-store sales lagged, with the company pointing to wary consumers and geopolitical headwinds. Harley-Davidson (HOG), meanwhile, pulled its full-year guidance altogether after international sales tumbled — citing the growing weight of global trade uncertainty. These warnings reinforce that tariff fears aren’t just weighing on Wall Street — they’re reshaping strategy in C-suites across America. And it’s not just large caps like McDonald’s feeling the strain. The Russell 2000, a barometer of small-cap performance, is down 13.5% so far this year — by far the hardest hit of the four major indexes. It’s a reminder that smaller companies, lacking the pricing power and global leverage of Big Tech, may be the sheer most vulnerable. A Wall Street Journal report suggesting Tesla’s (TSLA) board began looking to replace Elon Musk “about a month ago” was later denied by the board. Musk recently announced he’d been spending more time on Tesla, however. Tesla stock closed down slightly. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Despite reporting a negative first quarter, Etsy is crafting a message that it can stand out amid President Donald Trump’s trade war. The $4.4 billion marketplace for handmade and vintage goods fell far short of Wall Street’s expectations, losing 49 cents per share. But the company is leaning into the fact that over half of the products on its site are sourced from the U.S., and promoting tools that help buyers filter for locally made goods. Meanwhile, rivals like Temu and Shein have already raised prices due to tariffs. “Etsy’s relative value may get better particularly against sites who have a lot of their products sold made in China,” CEO Josh Silverman said on the company’s earnings call. A U.S. flag flies near containers stacked high on a cargo ship at the Port of Los Angeles. U.S. GDP contracted 0.3% in the first quarter, government estimates show, revealing the most comprehensive picture yet of the health of the country’s economy. It’s the weakest economic growth for the U.S. in three years, as the Bureau of Economic Analysis said the negative GDP reading “primarily reflected” an increase in imports, which surged as businesses aimed to get ahead of tariffs, and a decrease in government spending. MORE: President Donald Trump blamed the dip on former President Joe Biden, suggesting any decline in the second quarter could also be the former president’s fault. Trump has also blamed Biden for stock market losses, despite previously taking credit for gains during the last administration. Elon Musk and the chair of Tesla’s board strongly denied a report from the Wall Street Journal that said the carmaker’s board began a search for a new CEO to take over from Musk amid concerns about the company’s plunging stock price. The report claimed that Tesla’s board members had been in touch with recruitment firms to find a successor in an effort to appease “irritated” investors, but board chair Robyn Denholm dismissed the report as “absolutely false.” A crucial measure of inflation slowed in March to its lowest level in years, though it remains above the Fed’s 2% goal. Most economists view tariffs as inflationary, which is expected to complicate the central bank’s efforts to bring price increases down to historically palatable levels. In the midst of a pivotal week for big tech earnings, Microsoft reported its best-ever quarterly revenue and profit totals, while fellow big tech firm Meta also exceeded expectations. Amazon and Apple will report their quarterly results later today, and tariffs remain a looming question mark. “This is a key few days ahead for the markets and tech world,” remarked Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. Who is the richest person in each state? Who is the richest person in your state? Forbes’ latest ranking includes 54 entrepreneurs, investors and heirs worth a record $2 trillion combined, with billionaires in every state but three. Five states have a new wealthiest resident, for instance in Washington, where former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer beats out his old boss Bill Gates after Forbes upped its estimate of the 2021 divorce settlement secured by Gates’ ex-wife Melinda French Gates. Bots are flooding the internet, already making up 50% of all web traffic—a number that’s expected to surge with the adoption of AI. To combat the problem, San Francisco-based Persona is helping companies like OpenAI, LinkedIn and Reddit verify users’ identities, and on Wednesday, the company announced it had raised $200 million, bringing its valuation to $2 billion. As emerging defense companies get a major boost, Accel and New Enterprise Associates are co-leading a $275 million funding round into Chaos Industries, which sells a suite of communications and radar products. The funding, which Forbes reporting revealed values the company at $2 billion, follows a slew of funding rounds announced by Silicon Valley-backed defense tech companies this year. A resolution to reject President Donald Trump’s global tariffs failed in a 49-49 vote in the Senate on Wednesday, after two senators in support of the measure did not attend the vote. A spokesperson for Senator Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who was absent due to illness, reiterated the senator’s stance against the tariffs to Punchbowl News, saying McConnell “believes that tariffs are a tax increase on everybody.” Trump’s trade war with China threatens to make his immigration agenda costlier: Some of the biggest tech suppliers to border and immigration cops are warning about the possibility of increased prices nationwide. An increase in tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada “could have a significant impact on our business,” Axon Enterprise, which provides body cameras, Tasers and cloud-based evidence storage, wrote in an April SEC filing. After months of negotiations, the U.S. and Ukraine have signed an agreement creating the United States–Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund, which will reportedly allow the U.S. some access to Ukraine’s natural resources. The Treasury Department said in a statement the fund is in “recognition of the significant financial and material support that the people of the United States have provided to the defense of Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion” and will help “accelerate Ukraine’s economic recovery.” Pat Neal Florida homebuilder Pat Neal has become a billionaire by catering to the “marvelous middle”: middle- and upper-middle-class families spending between $400,000 and just over $1 million for a new home. “Our strategy is to float above the public homebuilders, to build a home of higher quality,” he says. That means marble surfaces, more landscaping, brick entryways, painted garage floors and cabinets made of solid wood. His company, Neal Communities, has a “perfection committee” that works on issues like making sure oven, microwave and refrigerator doors can open simultaneously without bumping into each other. All this attention to detail and focus on middle- and upper-middle income customers has been a winning strategy: The privately held business is now one of Southwest Florida’s biggest builders, and Forbes estimates that 76-year-old Neal, who owns 100% along with his two sons, has a net worth of $1.2 billion. But this year could test him like no other since the Great Recession. The western part of the Sunshine State, where Neal operates, has its highest housing supply in 15 years at the same time that Covid-era inward migration is dropping off. Home values there could decrease as much as 9% over the coming year, according to the real estate data platform Reventure. Macro trends don’t look favorable either, with high interest rates reducing demand for houses nationwide and the tariff war threatening to add thousands of dollars to the cost of building materials. To prepare, Neal is pivoting to a “barbell-shaped strategy,” going after folks at both the higher and lower ends. “Middle-class people in the last few years have not prospered as they previously did,” Neal says. “I’m moving to the edges for the present, hoping that the marvelous middle recovers over the course of time.” WHY IT MATTERS “Many experts think the housing market is set for one of its worst years in recent memory,” says Forbes reporter Monica Hunter-Hart. “The axe is already coming down hard in Florida, where builder Pat Neal says he’s slashing the prices of his houses by about 10% and simultaneously preparing to face rising costs due to tariffs. He’s implementing a risky plan to survive the economic turmoil; if it works, he’ll emerge stronger than ever.” MORE The Homebuilders Getting Rich Off America’s Housing Shortage A House Committee advanced an educational reform package this week that would overhaul student loans and make Pell Grants less accessible. The bill would also limit how much students can borrow from the federal government: Over $330 billion: How much the legislation would save the government, according to Rep. Tim Walberg (R-Mich.) 31.6%: The share of undergraduate students who were awarded Pell Grants in the 2022-23 school year The change ‘could reduce the number of people who enroll’ Jessica Thompson, senior vice president at the Institute for College Access & Success, told The Washington Post People often associate the term entrepreneurship with startups, but an entrepreneurial mindset can be valuable in any sector.

Title: Is META Stock Undervalued After A Solid Q1?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CHONGQING, CHINA - APRIL 26: In this photo illustration, the logo of Meta Platforms, Inc. is ... More displayed on a smartphone screen, with the company's infinity loop-style branding visible in the background, on April 26, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) Meta stock (NASDAQ: META) recently announced its Q1 performance, with revenues and earnings significantly surpassing street predictions. It registered sales of $42.3 billion and earnings of $6.43 per share, compared to the consensus forecasts of $41.3 billion and $5.22, respectively. The firm continued to enjoy advantages from a growing user base. Additionally, its outlook for Q2 was more promising than anticipated. META stock, which has seen a 5% decline since the start of the year, has exhibited performance in line with the larger NASDAQ index, which has decreased by 8%. The company’s investments in AI have begun to yield benefits in terms of increased user engagement, suggesting favorable prospects for its stock. However, if you are seeking positive returns with a smoother experience than that of a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P and recorded >91% returns since its inception. Meta Platforms’ revenues of $42.3 billion in Q1 represented a 16% year-over-year increase, driven by a 5% uptick in ad impressions and a 10% rise in average price per ad. Meta also noted a 6% increase in its family daily active people (DAP) to 3.43 billion. The company's primary revenue stream originates from advertising across its family of apps (Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp). The company is utilizing AI to enhance its ad targeting capabilities and is investing in AI-driven content generation. To support its AI strategies, Meta is undertaking considerable infrastructure investments, with anticipated capital expenditures ranging from $64-72 billion for 2025. Not only did the corporation report higher revenues, but its operating margin also expanded to 41%, rising by approximately 300 basis points year-over-year. Increased revenues and margin growth resulted in earnings of $6.43 per share, representing a 37% year-over-year increase. Looking ahead, Meta anticipates its Q2 revenue will be between $42.5 billion and $45.5 billion. At the midpoint of this range, the sales are aligned with the street expectation of $44 billion. Following the company’s impressive Q1 performance, META stock trended higher rising to $572. When examining the stock’s performance over a slightly extended timeframe, the appreciation in META stock over the past four years has been anything but steady, with annual returns being significantly more volatile than those of the S&P 500. The stock returned 23% in 2021, -64% in 2022, 194% in 2023, and 66% in 2024. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, is significantly less volatile. It has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 throughout the last four-year period. What accounts for this?Collectively, the HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; they represent a less erratic investment journey, as illustrated in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the prevailing uncertain macroeconomic climate involving tariffs and trade disputes, can META stock see substantial growth? We estimate Meta Platforms’ valuation at approximately $702 per share, which indicates a 23% upside potential from its current level of around $572. Our projections are based on a 27x price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which surpasses META’s four-year average P/E of 22x. This elevated valuation multiple seems warranted considering the firm’s recent robust advertising growth and enhanced profitability. Nevertheless, there are near-term risks to consider. Ongoing tariff challenges may lead to a reduction in ad spending from China, while Meta’s heavy investment in AI introduces uncertainty regarding whether these costs will ultimately yield substantial returns and significantly enhance the company's future earnings potential. While META stock appears to have significant growth potential, it’s beneficial to examine how Meta’s Peers perform on important metrics.

Title: Economic Digest: Nepal’s Business News in a Snap
URL: https://english.khabarhub.com/2025/01/462946/

Full Content:
01 May 2025 Time taken to read : 12 Minute KATHMANDU: Economic Digest offers a concise yet comprehensive overview of significant business happenings in Nepal, presented in easily digestible summaries. Despite an increase in trading activity, Nepal’s stock market posted a third consecutive decline, with the NEPSE index dropping by 8.14 points to close at 2,623, indicating persistent investor caution. While the trading volume surged to NPR 9.37 billion, gains were limited to a few sectors such as hydropower, microfinance, and trade, while major sectors like banking, finance, and tourism experienced notable losses. This subdued market performance occurs against a backdrop of mixed economic indicators: Nepal’s projected GDP growth of 4.61% and a rise in per capita income to USD 1,517 suggest signs of recovery, especially from non-agricultural sectors. However, persistent structural issues remain—revenue collection has failed to meet targets for three consecutive years, over 29% of industries do not comply with minimum wage laws, and high-profile infrastructure projects like the Gautam Buddha International Airport suffer from weak oversight. Furthermore, policy interventions such as Nepal Rastra Bank’s plan to absorb excess liquidity and regulatory changes to procurement laws reveal ongoing efforts to stabilize the financial system. Altogether, these developments reflect an economy striving for growth amid deep-rooted fiscal and institutional inefficiencies that continue to dampen investor confidence and economic resilience. Nepal stock market drops by 8.14 points despite rise in trading volume The Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) index declined for the third consecutive session on Wednesday, falling by 8.14 points to close at 2,623. The day’s highest point was 2,642. Despite the drop in the index, trading activity saw a notable uptick, with the total transaction volume reaching NPR 9.37 billion—up from NPR 7.57 billion the previous day. Among 314 traded companies, 136 saw declines in share prices, one remained unchanged, and a few posted gains. Most sector indices closed in the red. The banking sector dipped by 0.70%, development banks by 1.06%, finance by 1.24%, and hotel and tourism by 0.50%. Losses were also recorded in life insurance, investment, manufacturing, non-life insurance, and miscellaneous sectors, with declines ranging from 0.07% to 1.16%. In contrast, modest gains were seen in hydropower (0.61%), microfinance (0.04%), and trade (0.40%). Gold and silver prices drop slightly in Nepal The price of hallmark gold in Nepal dropped to NPR 188,100 per tola on Wednesday, down from NPR 188,800 the previous day. Silver prices also declined slightly to NPR 1,965 per tola, compared to NPR 1,970 the previous day, according to the Federation of Nepal Gold and Silver Dealers’ Association. Nepal’s economy projected to grow by 4.61% this fiscal year The National Statistics Office has projected Nepal’s economic growth at 4.61% for the current fiscal year, based on its preliminary national accounts estimates. This follows a revised growth rate of 3.67% for the previous fiscal year, which had initially been recorded at 3.87%. The estimate, calculated at consumer prices, points to a gradual economic rebound. The total size of the economy is expected to hit NPR 6.107 trillion by the end of FY 2081/82, up from NPR 5.704 trillion in the prior fiscal year. NRB to pull NPR 50 billion from financial system to absorb excess liquidity Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) plans to withdraw NPR 50 billion from the banking system on Wednesday as part of its ongoing effort to manage surplus liquidity. The central bank will use its deposit collection tool for a 21-day term to absorb the funds. Banks and financial institutions were invited to submit online bids by 3 PM. NRB has been conducting similar liquidity absorption operations twice weekly—on Sundays and Wednesdays—for the past 18 months due to persistent oversupply of funds in the financial sector. Per capita income in Nepal to reach USD 1,517 this year Nepal’s per capita gross national income (GNI) is projected to rise to USD 1,517 by the end of the current fiscal year, according to new figures from the National Statistics Office. This represents a USD 50 increase from last year’s per capita GNI of USD 1,467, which itself had gone up by USD 57 from the previous year. While the income trend continues upward, the rate of increase has slightly slowed. The GNI figure represents the average income per person, reflecting overall national earnings relative to the population. Revenue collection falls short of targets for three straight years Despite setting ambitious revenue targets, the government has consistently failed to meet them over the past three years. In fiscal year 2078/79, only 77.19% of the target was achieved, and just 74.43% the year before. So far this year, only 61% of the expected revenue has been collected by mid-Baisakh. However, the government continues to raise its targets, with this year’s budget set at NPR 1.86 trillion and next year’s target expected to climb even higher to NPR 1.9 trillion, as per the National Planning Commission. Subcommittee submits weak report on GBIA construction issues A parliamentary subcommittee formed to investigate irregularities in the construction of Gautam Buddha International Airport (GBIA) in Bhairahawa has submitted a report that has been criticized as weak. Led by former tourism minister and CPN-UML lawmaker Yogesh Bhattarai, the subcommittee failed to adequately address financial discipline, spending transparency, or provide a proper breakdown of the NPR 31.82 billion used in the project. Members of the committee included MPs such as Achyut Prasad Mainali, Dr. Amaresh Kumar Singh, and others. Critics, including members of the Audit Committee, expressed concern that the report ignored major issues observed during field inspections. Investment board approves structure and strategy The Investment Board of Nepal has approved its new organizational structure and business strategy during its 61st meeting, chaired by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. The board has also approved the post of a secretary and directed the office to complete a management survey based on the new structure. According to spokesperson Pradyumna Prasad Upadhyaya, the board plans to sign deals for 42 major projects worth USD 17.92 billion (NPR 2.45 trillion) by fiscal year 2085/86. No progress on social media registration despite repeated orders Despite multiple government orders, platforms like Facebook have not registered in Nepal. The government has extended the registration deadline several times, but no progress has been made. Minister for Communications and Information Technology Pradeep Subba Gurung recently gave a one-week deadline, but platforms, including Facebook’s parent company Meta, have not complied. Previously, TikTok had registered after facing a ban, but other platforms remain unregistered. Non-agricultural sector expected to fuel Nepal’s 4.61% GDP growth According to the latest projections by the Central Statistics Office, Nepal’s economy is set to expand by 4.61% this fiscal year, largely driven by gains in non-agricultural sectors. These sectors are forecast to grow by 4.28%. Meanwhile, the agricultural sector is expected to record a 3.28% increase. Rishiram Sigdel, Director of the National Accounts Division, said the projections reflect continued recovery momentum, with industry and services playing a leading role. Over 29% of industries fail to pay minimum wage A new report from GEFONT reveals that more than 29% of industries in Nepal have not implemented the minimum monthly wage of NPR 17,300. The labor audit covered 327 businesses across sectors such as manufacturing, textiles, tourism, education, and healthcare, and found widespread noncompliance with labor laws. SEBON approves IPO for Bikash Hydropower The Securities Board of Nepal (SEBON) has approved Bikash Hydropower Company’s request to issue an IPO. The company will now issue 4.45 million shares worth NPR 445.46 million at a face value of NPR 100 per share. Prabhu Capital will manage the IPO process. Procurement rules amended again to ease deadline extensions for contractors Nepal’s procurement regulations have been amended for the 14th time to allow easier extension of project deadlines. Contractors must now submit valid reasons for project delays, and applications for deadline extensions must be filed within 30 days of the amendment’s publication in the official gazette. Yarsagumba harvesting begins in Manang The collection of Yarsagumba (Cordyceps sinensis), a valuable medicinal herb, has started in Manang district. The harvesting season lasts from mid-Baisakh to the end of Asar. Locals collect the herb with permits issued by the Annapurna Conservation Area Project, following regulations and guidelines for conservation areas, national parks, and buffer zones. Nepal to import 119,000 metric tons of fertilizer for paddy farming To prevent a fertilizer shortage, Nepal is importing an additional 119,000 metric tons of fertilizer, including 94,000 metric tons of urea and 25,000 metric tons of DAP. The fertilizer is expected to arrive by the second week of Jestha, with shipments being handled by Agricultural Inputs Company Limited and Salt Trading Corporation. Gold traders can no longer charge recommendation fees Nepal Rastra Bank has barred gold traders’ associations from charging fees for issuing purchase recommendations. The new rule came after complaints about unfair charges. According to the NRB, all associations must now offer recommendations to traders for free. Hilsa border reopens but Mansarovar pilgrimage still banned Though the Hilsa border point with China reopened last year, the pilgrimage route to Kailash-Mansarovar remains closed. China shut down the route during the COVID-19 pandemic and has not reopened it since. The route had been used by around 15,000 Indian pilgrims annually before the closure. Temporary aerial tours had been launched but were later discontinued due to high costs and limited interest. Wheat output expected to fall in Kailali Wheat production in Kailali district is expected to decline slightly this year. According to the Agricultural Knowledge Center, average yield per hectare is estimated at 3.35 metric tons, down from 3.42 metric tons last year. The estimate is based on surveys in 11 local units, excluding hill areas like Chure and Mohanyal. Helicopter flights banned in Sagarmatha region during peak season Commercial helicopter flights have been banned in the Sagarmatha region during the busy mountaineering season. Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality issued a public notice warning against such operations and package sales, holding the responsible authorities accountable for any violations. Rule removed requiring manpower companies to send 100 workers abroad The mandatory rule requiring manpower companies to send at least 100 workers abroad annually has been scrapped. This provision, part of the Foreign Employment Act, was repealed through a recent bill passed by the House of Representatives. The rule had been in place since 2019 and was heavily opposed by manpower agencies.

Title: Meta Platforms crushes Wall Street’s earnings and revenue targets

UPDATED 20:51 EDT / APRIL 30 2025 by Mike Wheatley Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta Platforms Inc. delighted investors today as it crushed analysts’ targets on earnings and revenue, sending its stock higher in extended trading. The company reported first-quarter earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of $6.43 per share, well ahead of the $5.28 per share consensus estimate. Revenue for the period came to $42.31 billion, up 16% from a year earlier and easily beating the Street’s target of $41.4 billion. All told, Meta delivered a net profit of $16.64 billion in the quarter, rising from $12.37 billion one year ago. On a conference call, Meta Chief Financial Officer Susan Li told analysts that the company is looking for second-quarter revenue of between $42.5 billion and $44.5 billion, the midpoint of that range matching the Street’s target of $44.03 billion. She delivered the optimistic guidance while admitting the company has been hit by reduced ad spending from e-commerce exporters based in Asia. Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg (pictured) said on the call that the business is performing well. “I think we’re positioned to navigate the macroeconomic uncertainty,” he said, referring to the trade disruption that’s anticipated to arise from U.S. President Donald Trump’s recently imposed tariffs. The company said it’s reducing its forecast for total expenses to a range of between $113 billion and $118 billion, down from $114 billion to $119 billion. However, it also raised its forecast for capital expenditures to a range of $64 billion to $72 billion, up from its previous guidance of $60 billion to $65 billion. The increased capital expenditure will be directed at “additional data center investments” that aim to support the company’s ongoing efforts in artificial intelligence, it said. It also takes into account the expected increase in hardware costs, with data center servers and storage arrays likely to be impacted by the tariffs. “There’s just a lot of uncertainty around this, given the ongoing trade discussions,” Li said. She added that the company is working to mitigate some of this uncertainty by “optimizing” its supply chain as much as possible. Li also talked about a recent ruling by the European Commission, which decided that Meta’s no-ads subscription service is not compliant with its regulations. She said the ruling could lead to a “marginally worse user experience” for users based in Europe. More importantly, it could have a “significant impact” on its European revenue, which will likely be felt as soon as the third quarter. But she reassured investors that the company is trying to resolve this issue. “We are continuing to engage actively with the European Commission further on this, so we hope to have more clarity by next quarter’s call,” she promised. Meta said it delivered $41.39 billion in advertising revenue during the past quarter, beating the Street’s forecast of $40.44 billion. Moreover, it saw its number of daily active users rise to 3.43 billion across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, rising from 3.35 billion one year earlier and surpassing the analyst target of 3.39 billion. CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino told SiliconANGLE he was impressed by the resilience of Meta’s advertising business, which benefited from ad impression growth of 5% and an average price-per-ad increase of 10% during the quarter. “Meta’s execution on operating margin was also a notable positive, expanding to 41% from 38%, but we expect greater investments in AI to compress these margins later this year,” he added. “But daily active user growth remains healthy at more than 6%.” Zuckerberg said the company’s new Threads microblogging service, which is a rival to Elon Musk’s X platform, now has more than 350 million monthly active users, up from 320 million in January. He added that the company is now looking to push more ads on Threads, but Li tempered expectations by saying it’s unlikely to drive meaningful revenue growth this year. Elsewhere, the Meta AI digital assistant has grown to almost 1 billion monthly active users, up from 700 million in January. The vast majority of those users access the service through WhatsApp, Zuckerberg said. It’s also accessible through the Messenger app and Instagram, and this week the company announced it’s getting a standalone application of its own. According to Zuckerberg, the company is trying to work out how to best integrate ads with Meta AI, and also considering charging for a premium version of the digital assistant. However, it remains focused primarily on building out the product before it starts to monetize it, he said. Meta’s Reality Labs division, which is focused on building metaverse-related technologies, continues to be a money pit. The unit posted an operating loss of $4.2 billion in the quarter, lower than the $4.6 billion forecast from analysts. Its total sales came to $412 million, down 6% from a year earlier and lower than the analyst target of $492.7 million. Last week, Meta revealed it was cutting more than 100 jobs from the Reality Labs unit. Constellation Research Inc. analyst Holger Mueller said Meta is on a roll, growing nicely and investing in its future with one in four of its revenue dollars going towards its capital expenditures. “The big prize for Meta is AI, as the combination of reality and advertising represents the ultimate connection of consumers to its business,” he said. “In the meantime, investors will be watching to see how Meta handles the inevitable headwinds coming its way.” Li also talked about the company’s ad revenues stemming from the Asia-Pacific region, which came in at $8.22 billion, below the $8.42 billion analyst forecast. She explained that the company had seen reduced spend in the U.S. from Asian e-commerce retailers, saying that this is likely thanks to the imminent end of the “de minimis” loophole, which allows for tax-free imports of goods worth less than $1,000 to the U.S. Although a portion of that spend has been redirected to other markets, those advertisers have reduced their spending “below the levels prior to April,” Li said. Meta isn’t the only ad giant bracing itself for possible headwinds relating to the tariffs and other economic uncertainties. On Tuesday, Snap Inc. withheld its outlook as a result of the uncertain conditions, while Google parent Alphabet Inc. warned last week that it expects its advertising business to take a hit. Another major advertiser, Amazon.com Inc., will report its earnings on Thursday. Despite the ad uncertainty, investors were pleased enough with Meta’s results, and its stock gained more than 5% in extended trading. However, Meta’s shares are still down just over 6% in the year to date.

Title: Meta stock pops on stronger-than-expected revenue growth
URL: https://qz.com/meta-first-quarter-2025-earnings-ai-facebook-metaverse-1851778553

Meta (META) kicked off 2025 with a strong first quarter, delivering better-than-expected financial results and signaling continued momentum in its AI initiatives and core advertising business. The company reported first-quarter revenue of $42.31 billion, marking a 16% year-over-year increase. Net income surged to $16.64 billion, up 35% from the same period last year, while earnings per share rose 37% to $6.43. That’s better than consensus estimates, which had pegged Meta’s first-quarter 2025 earnings per share at $5.21 and a 13% rise in revenue to $41.2 billion. The rosy results initially drove Meta shares up more than 5% in after-hours trading. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement that the quarter was a “strong start to an important year.” And on the following call, he said this was a “pivotal moment” for the industry — in what he expects “will continue to be an intense year.” Leading the way for Meta was its advertising business. Ad impressions from the company’s family of apps (including Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram) were up 5%, and the average ad price increased 10% year-over-year. On the earnings call, chief financial officer Susan Li said the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth. Zuckerberg claimed on the call that integrating AI into its advertising department has helped drive revenue. “AI has already made us better at targeting and finding the audiences that will be interested in [businesses’] products,” Zuckerberg said. “I think that this is really redefining what advertising is — into an AI agent that delivers measurable business results at scale.” Meta is currently testing an ads recommendation model for reels, which the company said has increased conversion rates by 5%. Meta is seeing that 30% more advertisers used its AI creative tools in the last quarter. “If we deliver on this vision, then over the coming years, I think that the increased productivity from AI will make advertising a meaningfully larger share of global GDP than it is today,” Zuckerberg said. The CEO pointed to several advances in Meta’s artificial intelligence projects. Zuckerberg said that there are almost a billion monthly active users of Meta AI — and the company’s focus this year is on making it the “leading personal AI with an emphasis on personalization, voice conversations, and entertainment.” He envisions a world where AI is ever-present. Already, Meta AI is hard to avoid, after the company merged it with its search bar across its various apps. “I think that we’re all going to have an AI that we talk to throughout the day, while we’re browsing content on our phones,” Zuckerberg said. The company just released its first standalone AI app. He also pointed out continued development in the company’s AI-powered glasses — “Glasses are the ideal form factor for both AI and the Metaverse,” he said, touting the company’s collaboration with Ray-Ban (EL). Zuckerberg reaffirmed the company’s commitment to investing in these technologies — as it maintains the strength of its core platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Meta saw continued engagement growth, with daily active people reaching 3.43 billion in March 2025, a 6% increase from a year earlier. Meta indicated that its updated recommendation system has led to a 7% increase in time spent on Facebook, a 6% increase on Instagram, and a 35% increase on Threads. With its growing user count, Zuckerberg said that “business messaging should be the next pillar” of the business. He added, “I expect that, just like how every business today has an email address, social media account, and website, they’ll also have an AI business agent that can do customer support and sales.” The earnings report did have a noticeable dark spot: Losses deepened in Reality Labs, the cash-hemorrhaging division that’s home to Meta’s virtual and augmented reality hardware, software, and metaverse platforms — a $4.21 billion operating loss on $412 million in revenue. Meta lowered its projected full-year 2025 total expenses to between $113 billion and $118 billion, but increased its yearly capital expenditures to $64 to $72 billion, primarily driven by investments in AI infrastructure, Reality Labs, and other core business costs. The company has said it plans to invest up to $65 billion in AI infrastructure by 2025 — including building a data center nearly the size of Manhattan — with a strategic focus on building user engagement rather than direct monetization in the short term.

Title: Meta’s First Quarter Profit Soars 35%, Posts Second-Best Revenue Ever

Time Published: 2025-04-30T20:17:47Z

The parent company of Facebook and Instagram says it will spend up to $72 billion this year as it doubles down on AI spending Meta did not show any signs of an economic slowdown when it reported its first quarter earnings on Wednesday, with the parent company of Instagram and Facebook seeing its quarterly profit soar 35% compared to the same time a year ago. The company, led by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, also reported $42.31 in first quarter revenue, which was the second-best quarter in Meta’s history. “We’ve had a strong start to an important year, our community continues to grow and our business is performing very well,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement. “We’re making good progress on AI glasses and Meta AI, which now has almost 1 billion monthly actives.” Zuckerberg, on Meta’s earnings call on Wednesday, said he believes people will soon talk to personal AI bots “throughout the day” on their phones and AI-powered glasses. He added Meta is focused this year on “deepening the experience” users have with its AI technology. Here are the key results: Revenues: $42.31 billion, up 16% year-over-year and more than the $41.22 billion that was projected by analysts. As usual, most of Meta’s sales stemmed from ad revenue, which accounted for nearly 98% of its first quarter revenue. Meta reported the average price of an ad on its platforms increased 10% year-over-year. Asia-Pacific and “Rest of World” were the two places where Meta’s sales increased from the previous quarter, while they dipped in the U.S. and Europe. Net income: Meta reported $16.64 billion in net income, which was 35% higher than a year ago. Earnings per share of $6.43 topped the $65.22 EPS that analysts had projected, per Zack’s Investment Research. The $16.64 billion profit was the second-best in Meta history, following the $20.84 billion it reported during the holiday quarter of 2024. Daily active users: Daily users of one of Meta’s apps — which includes Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads– climbed 6% annually to 3.43 billion. Zuckerberg, on the company’s earnings call, said Threads, its X-like platform, has 350 million monthly active users. Notably, Reality Labs — Meta’s division focused on artificial intelligence, virtual reality and augmented reality technology — lost $4.21 billion between Jan. and March; Reality Labs continues to standout as the sector where Meta is spending more than it is making, after the company lost more than $17.5 billion on it last year. Capital expenditures more than doubled from a year ago to $13.69 billion, as Meta continues to invest in data centers for AI. Meta did not share any guidance on if it expects President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff plan to affect its business moving forward. CFO Susan Li, in a statement accompanying the first quarter report, said Meta was continuing to “monitor an active regulatory landscape, including legal and regulatory headwinds in the E.U. and U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.” The Menlo Park, CA.-based company projected second quarter sales of between $42.50 billion and $45.50 billion. Li, on the company’s earnings call, said the guidance’s range is due to “uncertainty” in how the macro environment will respond to ongoing trade discussions. It was a busy quarter for Meta, even by its own standards. The company started the year off by scrapping its third-party fact checking operation in favor of a feature similar to X’s Community Notes. Zuckerberg, during an appearance on “The Joe Rogan Experience” in Jan., likened the Meta fact checking team to George Orwell’s dystopian novel, “1984.” “We’ve reached a point where it’s just too many mistakes and too much censorship,” Zuckerberg said. That same month, Zuckerberg attended President Trump’s inauguration in Washington, D.C., alongside other tech executives like Apple CEO Tim Cook Amazon founder Jeff Bezos; many of the president’s fans who were in town for the inauguration told TheWrap that they were skeptical of Zuckerberg’s suddenly-warm relationship with President Trump. Other first quarter headlines for Meta include the company cutting 5% of its workforce to “move out low performers” and Zuckerberg saying the company would spend $60 billion-$65 billion this year to grow its artificial intelligence team and services; Meta updated that figure in its first quarter report on Wednesday, saying the company expected to spend up to $72 billion this year. On the AI front, Meta released its standalone AI app to compete with OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other AI models, like X’s Grok, on Tuesday. And after the first quarter wrapped, the FTC’s antitrust lawsuit against Meta started in mid-April. The FTC claims Meta’s purchase of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 helped it build a social media monopoly; Meta has argued it faces plenty of competition from apps like YouTube and TikTok. That case is currently ongoing. Meta’s stock price heading into Wednesday afternoon was down 9.60% since the start of the year. As TheWrap reported earlier this week, that is not out of the ordinary for the Big Tech companies, as the “Magnificent 7” companies as they are called — Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Tesla and Nvidia — seeing $2.71 trillion cut from their combined valuations since the start of 2025. The company’s stock price jumped 5% in after-hours trading, following the release of its earnings report. Something that stood out from Meta’s earnings call: Zuckerberg and Li did not mention President Trump or the word “tariff” once. On the company’s last earnings call in Jan., Zuckerberg had said it was nice to have American leaders who are “proud” of the country’s tech giants. Looking ahead, Zuckerberg said he anticipates users will have a more active relationship with the content they watch. “In the near future, I think that we’re going to have content in our feeds that you an interact with and that it’ll interact back with you, rather than you just watching it,” he said.

Title: Fiduciary Responsibility On The DEI Battlefield

ByKaren R. King andCatherine Foti ByKaren R. King, Contributor andCatherine Foti, Contributor. The political and legal landscapes on DEI programs are shifting rapidly. Presidential edicts and threats of government enforcement have driven some companies that once bragged about their diversity initiatives to now renounce them. Litigation risks, employee demands, shareholder concerns, and public outrage from all sides have left much of corporate America spinning. But in all the coverage of the twists and perils in the DEI war, there is little discussion about fiduciary duty. Pundits and academics may debate the nature of fairness and justice, but boardrooms face a more practical calculation. In a capitalist system aimed at profit, how is a fiduciary to shareholders supposed to navigate this moment? Corporate success has long been associated with innovation, understanding the market, and investment in the future. In the past, before the term “DEI” was coined, corporate strategists talked about expanding market share, attracting and retaining talent, and evolving to match the younger consumer base. While liberals pushed for equal opportunity and reparative justice, corporate America has always been most responsive to its bottom line. Indeed, it is the “business case” that likely accounts for the rapid rise of diversity initiatives in the last decade. Most notably, McKinsey’s 2015 report, “Why diversity Matters,” revealed a strong link between diversity and financial performance.[1] Based on an analysis of proprietary data from 366 public companies across a range of industries in Canada, Latin America, the United Kingdom, and the United States, McKinsey found that companies in the top quartile for racial and ethnic diversity are 35 percent more likely to have financial returns above their respective national industry medians. The study found a linear relationship between racial and ethnic diversity and better financial performance in the U.S.: every 10 percent increase in racial and ethnic diversity on the senior-executive team, resulted in an 0.8 percent rise in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). In 2018, Deloitte published a study showing similar results.[2] That study examined the financial turnaround at Quantas from an AUD$2.8 billion loss in 2013 to an AUD$850 million profit in 2017 with shareholder returns in the top quartile of its global airline peers and the ASX100. CEO Alan Joyce attributed the success to the investment in “a very diverse environment and a very inclusive culture” which “got us through the tough times… diversity generated better strategy, better risk management, better debates and better outcomes.” The Deloitte study also debunked the myth that diversity and inclusion hinders cohesion within teams. To the contrary, it found higher levels of collaboration and cohesiveness. In the early 2020s, many U.S. companies publicly touted their diversity and inclusion initiatives, including Target, Cisco, Microsoft and UnitedHealth Group. In 2020, Target became one of America’s most forceful supporters of DEI, pledging to increase its Black workforce by 20% over three years and take other steps to “advance racial equity,” including establishing an executive Racial Equity Action and Change committee to “focus specifically on how we can drive lasting impact” for Black employees and customers. The company vowed to spend more than $2 billion with Black-owned businesses by the end of 2025, including adding more products from 500 Black-owned vendors to stores, and pledging $100 million to support Black-led nonprofits and provide scholarships to students attending HBCUs. Target stores were redesigned with designated areas promoting “Pride” products, Black history month, and partnerships with sellers of color. But on the eve of Trump’s return to office, Target’s leadership dramatically reversed course, ending all efforts to increase diversity in its workforce, disbanding its executive racial equity committee, and changing its “supplier diversity” team to a “supplier engagement” team. It also stopped participating in external diversity-focused surveys. Target was not alone. Similar dismantling occurred at Boeing, Brown-Forman,Walmart, Google, and Meta. Consumer backlash was fierce. Various advocacy groups condemned the policy reversals and called for boycotts. The People’s Union USA designated February 28th for “economic blackout,” calling on consumers to refrain from buying goods from major offending retailers for 24 hours. On March 6th, Rev. Jamal Bryant from Atlanta and other faith and civil rights leaders, organized the “Target Fast” to begin the first day of Lent. The boycott was described as “a spiritual act of resistance.” Walmart, Whole Foods, and Amazon also faced calls for economic restraint by consumers. The economic fallout was immediate. Foot traffic in Target fell for nine consecutive weeks. Target’s stock plummeted by approximately $27.27 per share within the month of February, erasing $12.4 billion in market value. Walmart also saw foot traffic fall and over 20% drop in share price between mid-February and mid-March. In contrast, Costco had a shareholder vote on whether to review the risks of maintaining its DEI initiatives, and over 98% of the shareholders rejected the proposal. The board followed with a statement that it “believes that our commitment to an enterprise rooted in respect and inclusion is appropriate and necessary.” And consumers are now seemingly rewarding the move with their dollars. Costco saw an increase of 7.7 million visits and its stock hit an all-time high in February 2025. Costco also was not alone. Apple’s board similarly urged shareholders to reject a similar proposal. Delta Airlines told reporters on a Jan. 10 earning call that it is not reevaluating DEI or sustainability policies because “they are actually critical to our business,” stating DEI is “about talent and that’s been our focus.” Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing announced that the company stands “firmly behind” its “integral” DEI programs because “Deutsche Bank has benefited from it.” NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, in advance of a record-breaking Super Bowl LIX in terms of viewership and profit, defended the NFL’s practice of considering diverse candidates for head coach, general manager and coordinator positions “we’ve proven ... that it does make the NFL better.” The companies that have remained committed to DEI are facing pressure and threats from state AGs and federal agencies. In January, 19 states AGs collectively sent Costco a letter warning the company “end all unlawful discrimination imposed by the company through diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) policies.” Similarly, the Federal Communications Commission has opened investigations into Verizon, Comcast and Disney “to ensure that every entity the FCC regulates complies with the civil rights protections enshrined in the Communications Act... including by shutting down any programs that promote invidious forms of DEI.” Conservative groups have been active in bringing lawsuits that frame Target’s plummeting stock price as evidence of price inflation due to alleged misrepresentations about the benefits of DEI. Three related lawsuits are now pending in Florida against Target for securities fraud on this theory. But significant litigation risk exists in the other direction too. Most obviously, public statements about abandoning “diversity,” “equity,” and “inclusion” can run a company head-first into claims of violations of Title 7 and the American with Disabilities Act claims. And there exists a counterpoint to the securities lawsuits too. Those with a legal obligation to act in the best interest of shareholders can be held responsible for rash action leading to destruction of market value. While corporate directors and officers are typically protected by the “business judgment rule” from liability for business decisions that prove detrimental or unsuccessful, that protection is limited to decisions made in good faith, with reasonable care, and in the best interests of the corporation. Failure to examine the impact of DEI on corporate profit, growth, and consumer loyalty could be viewed as careless, reckless, and a breach of duty to the company and its shareholders. Some companies have already recognized the financial implications. Coca-Cola warned in its most recent annual filing that abandoning DEI could hurt business, because its diverse employee base “helps drive a culture of inclusion, innovation and growth,” and if the company’s employees do not reflect the “broad range of consumers and markets we serve around the world, our business could be negatively affected.” In any event, the Target case study is a cautionary tale against sudden reversals of corporate commitments based on the whims of the current Administration. As corporate leaders navigate the waters of the Administration’s war against DEI, a plaintiffs’ bar ready to pounce in both directions, and consumers that are fired up to vote with their wallets, failure to consider the full economic impact of DEI exposes fiduciaries to liability for breach of their duty.

The UK market slumped during the afternoon after the news of a 0.3 per cent fall in US gross domestic product (GDP) for the first three months of 2025, before eventually clawing back the losses. In banking, Barclays’ profits surged by nearly a fifth thanks to a boom in trading activity sparked by the US trade war but shares in the group fell by 1.4 per cent. The company reported a better-than-expected 19 per cent rise in pretax profits but it also said it set aside more cash for bad debts due to worries over the American economy. Drugmaker GSK (GlaxoSmithKline) said it is “well positioned” to cope with any financial impact from changes to US tariff rules, reporting a rise in sales and shares rose 3.7 per cent. Europe The European benchmark index marked its second consecutive monthly drop, however, falling 1.3 per cent. Energy was the worst-performing subindex for April, down 10.2 per cent, as the uncertainty around global growth eroded the outlook for oil demand. The STOXX 600 has recouped more than half of its losses after tumbling nearly 18% from record highs earlier this month, on signs of the White House’s willingness to ease trade tensions. Société Générale rose 3.7 per cent after the French bank reported stronger-than-expected first-quarter earnings. Danish logistics group DSV advanced nearly 7.8 per cent after it completed a deal to acquire Germany’s Schenker and provided an outlook on potential benefits from the transaction. On the downside, Glencore fell 7.3 per cent after the miner and trader reported a 30 per cent drop in copper production in the first quarter. Evolution slumped 19.3 per cent, the worst individual performer on STOXX 600, as the Swedish gaming technology company reported its first-quarter earnings below estimates. German carmakers Mercedes and Volkswagen suspended and cut guidance amidst uncertainty over U.S. tariffs. Their shares were down 2.7 per cent each. New York Wall Street’s main indexes were lower in early afternoon trading after data showed the economy contracted for the first time in three years in the first quarter, deepening concerns around the impact of U.S. tariffs and the global trade war. The Commerce Department’s advance gross domestic product report took centre stage on a data-packed day, showing a 0.3 per cent contraction for the first quarter, compared with expectations for 0.3% growth according to economists polled by Reuters. Declines were broad-based, with most S&P 500 sectors in the red and the energy index leading losses with a 3% drop. The economically sensitive small-cap Russell 2000 fell 1.3%. Meanwhile, “Magnificent Seven” members Meta Platforms and Microsoft fell 2.6% and 0.9% ahead of their results, due after markets close, that investors are watching closely for clarity on the outlook for the tech sector and AI-focused investments. Fanning concerns about a pullback in investments into AI, Super Micro Computer cut its third-quarter forecasts due to delays in customer spending, while Snapchat parent Snap said it would not provide a second-quarter financial forecast. Their shares fell nearly 15 per cent each. – Additional reporting, Reuters, PA.

US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that Americans should be patient in the face of a first-quarter economic contraction, arguing that his tariffs would eventually lead to a boom in the US economy. The economy shrank at a 0.3 per cent pace in the first quarter, weighed down by a deluge of goods imported by businesses eager to avoid higher costs, underscoring the disruptive nature of Trump's often chaotic tariff policy. Republican Trump blamed his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, for the poor showing. "This is Biden's Stock Market, not Trump's," he said. "Our Country will boom, but we have to get rid of the Biden 'Overhang.' Trump added: "This will take a while, has NOTHING TO DO WITH TARIFFS, only that he left us with bad numbers, but when the boom begins, it will be like no other. BE PATIENT!!!" Peter Cardillo, Chief Market Economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York, placed the onus on Trump. "We got to these numbers because of Trump's policies," Cardillo said. "They've created uncertainty and when you create uncertainty, nobody's going to put their foot on the accelerator. "We're seeing that as the earnings come out," Cardillo added. "Guidance has been pulled back." Indeed, the ongoing, multi-front trade war continues to cloud US corporate earnings season, with companies increasingly pulling or reducing guidance due to the fog of tariff uncertainties. Wall Street pared losses after the release of more upbeat economic indicators. Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index unchanged on a monthly basis and stronger-than-expected consumer spending. Two high-profile members of the "Magnificent Seven" group of artificial intelligence-related megacap companies, Meta Platforms and Microsoft, are expected to post results after the bell, and upbeat results would likely reverse Wednesday's selloff. "We think it's irrational for people to sell off, particularly tech stocks as hard when we got the real big kahunas reporting," said Jay Hatfield, portfolio manager at InfraCap in New York. "If we had this call tomorrow, we could be trying to explain why a market's up 2%." The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 466.73 points, or 1.15%, to 40,061.02, the S&P 500 fell 83.29 points, or 1.50%, to 5,477.54 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 343.74 points, or 1.97%, to 17,117.58. European stocks erased previous gains following the U.S. GDP data. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe fell 8.10 points, or 0.97%, to 823.21. The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.12%, while Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index fell 3.70 points, or 0.18%. Emerging market stocks rose 4.65 points, or 0.42%, to 1,110.64. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed higher by 0.78%, to 580.07, while Japan's Nikkei rose 205.39 points, or 0.57%, to 36,045.38. The dollar held its gains after a swath of mixed U.S. economic data. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro, rose 0.26% to 99.42, with the euro down 0.19% at $1.1363. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar strengthened 0.3% to 142.75. Sterling weakened 0.5% to $1.3339. The Mexican peso weakened 0.35% versus the dollar at 19.626. The Canadian dollar strengthened 0.08% versus the greenback to C$1.38 per dollar. After the weaker-than-expected read on first-quarter economic growth, the yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes fell 1 basis point to 4.164%, from 4.174% late on Tuesday. The 30-year bond yield rose 1.5 basis points to 4.6626% from 4.648% late on Tuesday. The 2-year note yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations for the Federal Reserve, fell 4.5 basis points to 3.613%, from 3.658% late on Tuesday. Oil prices slid further, set for their largest drop in nearly 3-1/2 years as Trump's trade war eroded the demand outlook. U.S. crude fell 1.89% to $59.30 a barrel and Brent fell to $63.22 per barrel, down 1.6% on the day. Gold prices dipped in opposition to the dollar. Spot gold fell 0.39% to $3,302.72 an ounce.

Title: Meta earnings live updates: Wall Street watching for AI spending, impact of tariffs on advertising

It was another good quarter for Meta, which reported first-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the closing bell, beating sales and earnings-per-share estimates. Investors had been looking out for updates on its AI spending and plans, whether it's seeing any blowback from advertisers after Meta's controversial announcement that it's cutting back on content moderation, and any comments about the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs. CEO Mark Zuckerberg was as bullish as ever on the company's AI plans and praised its Reality Labs division, which has routinely lost around $4 billion in each of the past several quarters. Meta is also raising its spending estimates for the year to invest further in AI data centers and infrastructure. Meanwhile, strong ad revenue showed advertisers weren't put off by the company's content moderation pullback which has recently begun taking effect and which includes replacing third-party fact-checking with community notes. The conversation was more muted, though, on tariffs. Zuckerberg kicked off the investor call by saying Meta is "well-positioned to navigate the macroeconomic uncertainty," though he didn't mention Trump or his tariffs by name. CFO Susan Li similarly referenced the "dynamic micro environment." The company did speak out about the European Commission's recent decision that the company violated the Digital Markets Act. Meta plans to appeal the decision, which came with a €200 million fine, but said it expects it'll need to make modifications that "could result in a materially worse user experience for European users and a significant impact to our European business and revenue" as early as Q3. The company reported revenue for the period of $42.31 billion, beating Bloomberg's consensus analyst estimate of $41.38 billion. It also issued a second-quarter sales forecast in line with expectations. Meta's stock rose more than 5% in volatile after-hours trading shortly after the results. Shares had fallen 1% on Wednesday, putting the stock down 7% so far in 2025 at the close. Evercore analyst Mark Mahaney asked whether Meta's consistent $4 billion-per-quarter Reality Labs losses would ever come down, and if so, why and when. Zuckerberg pointed to the rising momentum behind Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses, saying they've "really taken off" and just "tripled in sales" in the last year. "There are more investments that I think make sense to make around making sure that we can distribute this and grow it very quickly," he added. "If you look at some of the leading consumer electronics products of other categories, by the time they get to their third generation, they're often selling 10 million units and scaling from there," Zuckerberg said. "I'm not sure if we're going to do exactly that," he said, "but I think that's like the ballpark of the opportunity." Zuckerberg briefly talked about how AI is going to change how people consume and create content online. While social media platforms mostly started off as text-based feeds, then photo, and are now in the "video era," Zuckerberg said that the next big thing could be interactive content. "In the near future, I think that we're going to have content in our feeds that you can interact with and that it'll interact back with you rather than you just watching it," Zuckerberg said on the call. He recently said on Theo Von's "This Past Weekend" podcast that tech will move away from mobile phone screens and to holograms. Threads, which Meta launched in 2023 to compete with X (formerly Twitter), has surpassed 350 million monthly active users, Zuckerberg said on the call. It "continues to be on track to become our next major social app," he added. AI's improvements to Meta's content recommendation systems also contributed to a 35% increase in time spent on Threads, Zuckerberg said. Zuckerberg also kicked off the call talking about the company's AI work, calling this "the major theme" at Meta right now. He listed 5 ways AI usage is playing out at Meta: "Improved advertising, more engaging experiences, business messaging, meta AI, and AI devices." While he noted these are "long-term investments that are downstream from us," he added that he thinks further down the road the company "will be wildly happy with the investments that we are making." Both of these sentiments should sound familiar, as he's given similar remarks when pressed on the company's AI initiatives and spending in previous earnings calls. In his opening remarks, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Meta is "well-positioned to navigate the macroeconomic uncertainty" — but didn't explicitly name President Trump or cite his tariffs. CFO Susan Li prefaced the company's guidance estimates by acknowledging the "dynamic macro environment" and noting the range "reflects the potential for a wider set of outcomes." "We continue to feel good about the fundamental drivers of revenue growth, and believe the past work we've done to streamline our operations and cost profile puts us in a strong position to navigate a variety of outcomes," she said. However, some listeners (including at BI!) noted glitches as Zuckerberg started to speak. Who the hell is running $META conference call! Keeps glitching Investing.com senior analyst Thomas Monteiro says the company's AI integration plan "not only keeps growing at an impressive rate but also does so without burning through piles of cash, unlike most of the competition." "Meta is quietly gaining ground as one of the greatest winners of the AI revolution — with still lots of tailwinds and room for expansion," he said. While tariff uncertainty means eyes are on Meta's APAC ad revenue from retailers like Temu and Shein advertising to US consumers, the company is well-positioned to "free up margins from other parts of the operation without damaging its longer-term growth plans" if those figures skew lower, Monteiro adds. As EMARKETER senior analyst Minda Smiley points out, Meta's strong earnings and healthy ad business show its massive content moderation overhaul in January, which included ending its fact-checking program and switching to a community notes-based model, didn't scare off advertisers. The next test will be staying strong in the uncertain macroeconomic environment stemming from tariffs, though Meta's sheer size and reach should help safeguard them. "Advertisers will allocate more ad dollars to proven, sophisticated networks like Facebook and Instagram — all while pulling back spend on smaller social platforms — while they navigate uncertainty," Smiley notes. When big tech companies like Meta do mass layoffs — as the company has done over the last couple of years — it gets plenty of attention. So you might be surprised to learn that in addition to firing thousands of people, Meta has also been hiring. You can see that story buried in the company's earnings reports. After the first quarter of 2023, Meta had 77,114 fulltime employees. Then the company pushed out huge swaths of its employees, and by the end of that year it was down to 67,317. Meta continues to cut and trim throughout the company — it just rolled out cuts to its Reality Labs division, as we note below. But at the same time, it has also been hiring! Meta now says it has 76,834 employees. That's an 11% increase over the previous year, and it means Mark Zuckerberg's workforce has almost exactly as many people as it did two years ago. Meta's Reality Labs division, which builds the Quest VR headsets, Ray-Ban smart glasses, and the Horizon Worlds platform, posted a $4.2 billion loss. That's wider than the $3.85 billion loss a year ago, but narrowed from $4.65 billion last quarter. The unit remains a massive money sink, with over $50 billion in cumulative losses since 2020. Just last week, Meta laid off staff from its VR gaming teams and the Supernatural VR fitness app as part of a broader shakeup. Still, the company is keeping its foot on the gas — nearly 500 Reality Labs jobs remain open. One bright spot? Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses, which Zuckerberg sported at LlamaCon, the company's first event for AI developers yesterday, have become a surprise hit. Meta is reportedly expected to launch a new version with a built-in display later this year. The European Commission, the main executive body of the European Union, recently published a decision finding that Meta breached the Digital Markets Act, a set of regulations in the bloc meant to regulate the power of six digital "gatekeepers," aka Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta, and Microsoft. The Commission consequently fined Meta €200 million. Meta weighed in on the decision in its earnings report. "We expect we will need to make some modifications to our model, which could result in a materially worse user experience for European users and a significant impact to our European business and revenue as early as the third quarter of 2025," the company said. Meta will appeal the decision but said that changes to its model may be made before or during the appeal process. The company is being closely watched this earnings season, along with its Big Tech peers, for comments about its AI spending. It raised its estimate for full-year capital expenditures from a prior range of $60-$65 billion to $64-$72 billion now. That's up significantly from its full-year 2024 capex of $39.23 billion. The increase "reflects additional data center investments to support our artificial intelligence efforts as well as an increase in the expected cost of infrastructure hardware." Meta said in its earnings report, however, that the majority of its capex this year will go toward its "core business." First quarter Revenue: $42.31 billion, +16% y/y, estimate $41.38 billion Operating income: $17.56 billion, +27% y/y, estimate $15.52 billion Ad impressions: +5% vs. +20% y/y, estimate +6.87% Second quarter forecast Full-year 2025 Capital expenditure: $64 billion to $72 billion, saw $60 billion to $65 billion, estimate $59.27 billion Source: Bloomberg data Meta stock dipped 1% ahead of its earnings release on Wednesday after the closing bell. The S&P 500 closed 0.2% higher, while the Dow rose 0.4%. Stocks were broadly lower on Wednesday after the release of first-quarter GDP, which dropped at an annualized rate of 0.3%, but reversed the losses into the close. It seems like the Meta CEO has been everywhere ahead of his company's earnings report. From his marriage to AI trends, Zuck is getting deep this week during livestreams and podcast appearances. He opened up about the 7-foot statue he dedicated to his wife and got real about higher education. The question on everyone's lips this earnings season is how companies plan to tackle tariffs. Zuckerberg seems to be taking a wait-and-see approach when asked about it, but investors will want some answers. A day before its earnings, Meta held its first-ever AI developer event, LlamaCon, unveiling a new Llama API. The company also announced a standalone Meta AI app, its most direct challenge yet to OpenAI's ChatGPT. CEO Mark Zuckerberg was joined onstage by Microsoft's Satya Nadella and Databricks' Ali Ghodsi, underscoring Meta's push to become central to the AI developer ecosystem. The event wasn't just about product announcements — it was a calculated play to reassure investors. "I expect Meta's earnings release and subsequent call to be packed with AI news," Forrester VP Mike Proulx told Business Insider, "not only because the company is making real and tangible progress, but also to counterbalance the intense pressure Meta is facing on multiple fronts," he said, pointing to the ongoing FTC antitrust trial against the company. Expect Wall Street to listen closely during today's earnings call for signs that Meta's massive AI investments — including up to $65 billion in 2025 capex — are starting to deliver returns. Meta's X competitor, Threads, had 320 million monthly active users at the time of the company's last earnings call, adding a million new people daily. It's one of the few recent social apps to scale this quickly, and Meta is finally starting to test monetization. Last week, the company began rolling out ads on Threads globally. Still, Meta executives have said they don't expect the app to contribute meaningful revenue in 2025. For now, it's about playing the long game. Zuckerberg has said Threads could one day reach a billion users and become "the leading discussion platform." The question for Wall Street is whether Meta can sustain the momentum. Meta hasn't commented on whether the US-China trade war will hurt its bottom line, but it's another thing investors will be watching closely over the next few earnings cycles. Meta has said that 11% of its total ad sales last year came from Chinese advertisers, which could dial back their spending as the trade war looms. With tariffs on Chinese imports now as high as 145%, many companies can't afford to sell into the US market, which means there's less incentive to advertise to American shoppers. If that trend accelerates, it could negatively impact Meta's ad business. Analysts will be closely watching Meta's investments in generative AI and its Reality Labs division, which has hemorrhaged money in recent quarters. Zuckerberg has said he's happy to keep funneling tens of billions in additional capex on generative AI even as analysts and investors press Big Tech for answers on when they'll see the massive spending pay off. Meta recently held its inaugural LlamaCon, an AI developer conference. The conference featured remarks from Meta executives, including Zuckerberg, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi. On Tuesday, the company also announced a standalone Meta AI app to compete with ChatGPT. Wells Fargo said it expects Meta to be the "steadiest ship in a brewing macro storm," arguing that its dominance relative to other advertising platforms should shield it from some of the macroeconomic pain. "Checks indicate ad spend growth on Meta moderated throughout the qtr, but likely more resilient vs. other ad platforms against softer macro backdrop given minimal brand exposure," Wells Fargo said. The bank said Meta's Reels platform, which directly competes against TikTok, should have benefited from the uncertainty surrounding a potential TikTok ban earlier this year. "Checks suggest ad spend on TikTok shifted to Meta during the heightened uncertainty in Jan, with some budgets permanently moving to Reels," the bank said. Wells Fargo rates Meta Platforms at "Overweight" with a $752 price target. A major topic during Tesla's earnings call last week was blowback over Elon Musk's political involvement with the Trump administration. While Zuckerberg's ties to the White House aren't as deep as Musk's, he has been increasingly involved with Trump 2.0 — and investors could make it known whether they approve. Zuckerberg has had a contentious relationship with the president over the years; Trump once threatened the Meta CEO with life in prison. However, since the election, Zuck has seemed to try to smooth things over. Meta donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration and Zuckerberg was among the tech billionaires who got a front row seat to the swearing in This year, Meta partnered with the White House to bring the Easter Egg Roll. Despite macroeconomic concerns, JPMorgan said that Meta's strong execution and AI opportunities should help the company's results. "We believe META remains well-owned driven by strong execution & growing AI monetization," JPMorgan analysts wrote. "We're bullish on AI-driven Ad improvements, video unification, WhatsApp Ads, Llama, & Meta AI." The bank said it believes investors expect Meta Platforms' revenue to grow by about 13% year over year. Meeting or beating those expectations would likely boost the stock. It said that while macro factors are a concern, "tens of millions of advertisers should prove relative insulation." With regards to capex, JPMorgan expects the company to maintain its aggressive investment philosophy to capture the AI opportunity. "Our $108B 2025 GAAP expenses is below Meta's $114B-$119B guide as we expect META to rationalize expenses against lower growth," JPMorgan said. JPMorgan rates Meta Platforms at "Overweight" with a $610 price target. Investors will be watching closely to see if Meta's Reality Labs — its hardware and virtual reality division — is cutting back on its burn rate after racking up more than $50 billion in losses since 2020. The division, responsible for products like Quest headsets and smart glasses, was reorganized in January with key leaders now reporting directly to Meta's top brass. Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth has called 2025 "the most critical" year for Reality Labs, writing in an internal memo obtained by BI earlier this year that it could determine whether the effort is remembered as a visionary feat or a "legendary misadventure." He also stressed that Horizon Worlds on mobile must succeed for Meta's metaverse ambitions to stay afloat. Bosworth said Reality Labs grew sales 40% in 2024 and cited "massive" growth in wearables. But investors will want to see if those revenue gains are enough to begin narrowing the division's steep losses, which totaled $4.4 billion in Q3 of 2024 alone. Bank of America is leaning bullish on Meta heading into its coming earnings release. The bank said takeaways from Alphabet's comments on YouTube and its advertising checks should fuel a "modest beat" for Meta. Meta's workforce reductions in February and recent layoff announcements related to its Reality Labs division suggest that management is laser-focused on controlling operating expenses. "For expense guide, we would expect a trajectory toward the low end of the current $114-$119bn 2025 range," Bank of America said. The bank is also bullish on Meta's growing AI capabilities and its potential to unlock more advertising spending. "We think Meta's Al driven ad improvements still have several quarters to play out and for 2025 we see strong drivers of growth, including: 1) Expanding AI/ML ad capabilities, 2) Growing SFV usage aided by AI suggestions, 3) Growing messaging revenues, & 4) Monetization of untapped surfaces (Threads, Meta Al, Marketplace)," the bank said. SFV refers to "short form video." Bank of America rates Meta Platforms at "Buy" with a $640 price target. An elephant in the room is the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust trial against Meta. The company isn't expected to discuss the ongoing case during its earnings call, and the litigation isn't expected to have a significant impact on the results. The trial kicked off earlier this month, and Zuckerberg testified over three days. The FTC alleges that Meta, then Facebook, violated US antitrust laws when it bought Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 and WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014. Asked about Meta's acquisition of Instagram, Zuckerberg testified that he considered having Facebook build its own photo-sharing service, but ultimately, "I thought that Instagram was better at that, so I thought it was better to buy them." Meta's attorneys have argued that the company still faces competition from social media platforms including TikTok, YouTube, and X. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said Meta's Reels platform has the potential to drive significant growth for the company. "We still see a sizable opportunity for Reels to remain a key revenue growth tailwind for META in the coming years as the CPM gap closes further and as Reels continues to increase as a % of total ad impressions," Goldman Sachs said. On the spending front, the bank expects Meta to "somewhat pull back" on its planned investments due to macroeconomic headwinds. Goldman expects 2025 total GAAP expenses of about $110.5 billion, slightly below the company's guidance range of $114 billion to $119 billion. "For META, we see the key debates being how the company indicates a framework of balance between long-term investments and annualized operating costs if the macroeconomic environment impacts the business in the coming quarters," Goldman Sachs said. Goldman Sachs rates Meta Platforms at "Buy" with a $685 price target.

ByTom Aspray ByTom Aspray, Contributor. American recession and USA economy contraction cycle as a US decline The quite rare Zweig Breadth Thrust (ZBT) last week has been supported by the early action this week which adds further weight to the bullish case. This is quite interesting in light of the major earnings out this week from Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) after the close today. They will be followed on Thursday by earnings from Apple, Inc. (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN). Performance Table All of these four stocks have performed quite well over the past 5 days led by a double-digit gain for META up 10.83%. There are solid gains for the other stocks with 8.2% for AMZN, MSFT + 7.4%, and AAPL up 5.7%. During the same period, the S&P 500 (SPX) is up 5.16%. RS MSFT, META, AAPL, AMZN These six-month charts all show the steady declines from early in the year. The declining 20-day MAs (blue) for all are below their 50-day MA (in red) despite the recent sharp gains. Below the candle charts is plotted the relative performance (RS) which reflects the ratio of the stock price to the S&P 500. All except MSFT are lower than the SPX over the past month except MSFT as it is up just over 4%. Over the past three months, all four stocks have been weaker than the SPX which is down 7.92%. The worst performer has been AMZN which is down 20.96%. On the charts above only the RS pattern for MSFT shows signs of a bottom as it has formed higher lows, line b. A move in the RS for MSFT above the downtrend, line a, would be a positive development. The lower lows in the RS for the other three stocks and the sharply declining MAs suggest it is too early for a sustainable bottom. Spyder Trust With A/D Lines As for the overall market, the Spyder Trust (SPY) is up 0.7% this week and is well above the tentative May pivot at $534.51. The declining 50-day MA is at $559 and the 100-day at $577.85. The 20-day EMA has turned up slightly at $541.49 and represents good support. More importantly, the S&P 500 A/D line has now moved above the major resistance at line a. This indicates that the decline from the late 2024 highs is over. A retest of the breakout level is always possible, especially with the key earnings and monthly jobs report this week. The NYSE Stocks Only A/D line is still below its downtrend, line b, but is well above its EMA which is now rising. The NYSE All A/D line closed at its downtrend, line c, as the short-term resistance at line d, was broken last week. The Nasdaq 100 A/D (not shown) has also completed its correction and the relative performance indicates that QQQ is starting to lead the SPY. Based on the data through Tuesday’s close, all the weekly A/D lines should close positive this week. These developments further support buying on market corrections.

Title: Weaker Than Forecast GDP; Meta And Microsoft Announce Earnings After The Close

ByJJ Kinahan ByJJ Kinahan, Senior Contributor. Microsoft is scheduled to release earnings tonight after the market closes along with earnings due ... More out from Facebook parent, Meta Platforms. (Photo by Jeenah Moon/Getty Images) Key Takeaways Stocks closed modestly higher on Tuesday with the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and Russell 2000 all posting gains of around 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the best performer, up 0.8%. The economic data and earnings reports began building momentum as well and will pick up speed on Wednesday. Overnight, there were a couple of notable earnings announcements worth mentioning. Starbucks missed on both earnings and revenues. The coffee company also said same store sales fell for the fifth consecutive quarter and looking forward, there could be headwinds from tariffs. That stock is indicated lower by around 8% in premarket. Caterpillar also announced earnings. This is a company that will likely be very sensitive to tariffs. Nearly 10% of sales come from China and Brazil represents 6%. Like many companies, Caterpillar provided guidance for two different scenarios and investors seem to like the outlook as the stock is higher in premarket by 3%. On the economic calendar, we have some big reports out Wednesday morning. Both the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index and first quarter GDP are either out or will be released later in the day. Forecasts for Core PCE, which removed food and energy, are for an increase of 2.6% year-over-year and 0.1% month-over-month. If you add back food and energy, the forecasts are for increases of 2.2% and flat, respectively. The actual PCE numbers will be released later this morning. GDP was forecast to have gown 0.1% in the first quarter, but the preliminary reading released today shows GDP actually contracted 0.3%. On a related note, the effects of the trade war are being seen in places other than the U.S. China reported April exports were at the lowest levels since COVID-19. Manufacturing is also slowing, hitting its lowest level in more than a year. China has insisted it will not bend to President Donald Trump's tariffs, but with multiple signs of economic weakness permeating their economy, there will certainly be pressure to resolve the situation. Back here at home, the tariff impact is causing several companies to pull forward guidance or issue multiple forecasts that account for variations in economic conditions. This is something I discussed Monday, and I expect this trend will continue. Retailers such as Target and Walmart, which have thus far managed to avoid price increases, warned of higher prices being an inevitability. Also, according to an article in The Wall Street Journal, some retailers are also beginning to discuss the possibility of scarcity for certain items. There have been other reports downplaying this risk, but it is something worth monitoring. For today, there are a few things I’m watching, starting with crude oil. Oil prices fell below $60 per barrel overnight. Lower oil prices are good for consumers and show up in the lower prices at the gas station. At the same time, when oil gets too low, it can be seen as a recession indicator. I’m not convinced at just below $60 we’re seeing a red light on the economy, but it is something to watch, especially in conjunction with Wednesday’s GDP report. I'm also watching how markets ultimately interpret the economic data. The lower than forecast GDP number is a confirmation of what we've been seeing with respect to consumer confidence which has been falling. Markets have already sold off in premarket following its release. If the PCE numbers come in higher than forecast, don't be surprised if you begin hearing a lot more talk about stagflation. Finally, after the close today we have several big-name earnings. Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Qualcomm are all scheduled to report. The expected move in Meta for the rest of the week is $42. In Microsoft, that move is nearly $18 and for Qualcomm, it is $9. Then after the close on Thursday, Amazon and Apple will report. For Amazon, the expected move is $12 and for Apple, it is $9. These numbers are important for both stock and options traders as it gives you an idea of the range in which these stocks are expected to trade this week. As always, I would stick with your investing plan and long-term objectives. tastytrade, Inc. commentary for educational purposes only.

Title: Meta Earnings: AI Push, Tariff Impact, & Ad Revenue Are In Focus

More 2025, shows the logo of Meta, the US company that owns and operates Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp. (Photo by Fabrice COFFRINI / AFP) (Photo by FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP via Getty Images) Meta Platforms is scheduled to report earnings after Wednesday’s close. The stock recently hit a record high near $740.91/share and is currently trading near $554. The stock is prone to big moves after reporting earnings and can easily gap up if the numbers are strong. Conversely, if the numbers disappoint, the stock can easily gap down. To help you prepare, here is what the Street is expecting: The company is expected to report a gain of $5.22/share on $41.27 billion in revenue. Meanwhile, the so-called Whisper number is a gain of $5.40/share. The Whisper number is the Street's unofficial view on earnings. The company has grown its earnings nicely over the last several years. In 2020 the company earned $9.78; in 2021, the company earned $13.77. In 2022, earnings fell to $8.59. Then, in 2023 earnings soared to $15.56. in 2024, earnings jumped to $23.86 and are expected to grow to $24.58 in 2025. In 2026, earnings are expected to grow again to $27.89. Meanwhile, the stock sports a price to earnings ratio of 23 which is near the S&P 500. Click on the chart to join Market Surge Technically, the stock is in a multimonth downtrend and trading below its important moving averages. Near term resistance is the 200 DMA line and then the 50 DMA line. On the downside, near-term support is 493 to 500. That said, the stock can easily gap up and that’s what the bulls want to see after earnings are announced. Conversely, the bears want to see it gap down and fall. Meta Platforms, Inc. engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. It operates in two segments, Family of Apps and Reality Labs. The Family of Apps segment offers Facebook, which enables people to share, discuss, discover, and connect with interests; Instagram, a community for sharing photos, videos, and private messages, as well as feed, stories, reels, video, live, and shops; Messenger, a messaging application for people to connect with friends, family, communities, and businesses across platforms and devices through text, audio, and video calls; and WhatsApp, a messaging application that is used by people and businesses to communicate and transact privately. The Reality Labs segment provides augmented and virtual reality related products comprising consumer hardware, software, and content that help people feel connected, anytime, and anywhere. The company was formerly known as Facebook, Inc. and changed its name to Meta Platforms, Inc. in October 2021. The company was incorporated in 2004 and is headquartered in Menlo Park, California. From where I sit, the most important trait I look for during earnings season is how the market and a specific company reacts to the news. Remember, always keep your losses small and never argue with the tape. Disclosure: The stock has been featured on FindLeadingStocks.com

Title: Donald Trump’s first 100 days mark worst for US stock market since Gerald Ford

US stocks have lost more than 7 per cent during the rollercoaster first 100 days of US President Donald Trump’s second term – the worst start for a new administration since Gerald Ford assumed the presidency five decades ago. Wall Street’s S&P 500 has declined 7.2 per cent since inauguration day as Mr Trump’s aggressive trade agenda has unleashed waves of volatility that have rocked investors’ faith in America’s growth prospects and fuelled concerns about a tariff-induced inflation rebound in the world’s biggest economy. It closed 0.6 per cent higher on Tuesday. The last time the blue-chip index, which hit a record high in mid-February, fell further during a president’s first 100 days in office was in the second half of 1974 when Ford entered the White House following the resignation of Richard Nixon, according to Financial Times calculations based on FactSet data. US stocks were then caught up in a protracted sell-off driven by a recession and rapidly rising oil prices. Half a century later, Mr Trump’s attempts to upend the global trade system by slapping steep “reciprocal” tariffs on most countries have plunged US financial markets into fresh turmoil, strategists and investors said. “We’ve decided to have a fight with every kid in the playground at the same time,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “Markets are telling us that there is doubt about whether the US has the advantage when they’ve taken on the whole rest of the world.” Investors have been left dazed by the barrage of trade-related announcements coming from the White House in recent months, according to George Pearkes, a macro strategist at Bespoke Investment Group. Stocks tumbled after Mr Trump’s sweeping tariff announcements on April 2nd, but have recovered much of those losses after the bulk of the levies were postponed for 90 days. “My model for where we are is Wile E Coyote with his legs spinning in the air trying to figure out how big of a cliff we’ve just jumped off,” Mr Pearkes said. The market decline this year has caught off guard most Wall Street investors who had forecast a market boom under a tax-cutting, deregulatory Republican administration. More than 10 of America’s largest banks have in recent weeks slashed their end of year S&P 500 price targets amid an exodus of capital from dollar-denominated assets. Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said investors “have a right to feel exhausted”. Mr Trump’s “liberation day” tariff blitz “catalysed the market chaos”, she added, “with on again, off again tariff policies promulgating maximum uncertainty periodically punctuated by statements from the administration aimed at reassurance and de-escalation”. Foreign investors began the year owning a record 18 per cent of US equities but have sold roughly $60 billion (€52.7 billion) of their holdings since the start of March, according to Goldman Sachs. European money managers have driven the bulk of the selling. Both the dollar and US Treasuries have also been hit by investors’ response to Trump’s erratic tariff announcements. In equity markets, recently high-flying US tech stocks have been hardest hit, both by Trump’s tariffs and the emergence of Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek, which stunned investors in January when it claimed to have built a large language model for a fraction of the cost of its Silicon Valley rivals. In December, Tesla, Alphabet, Nvidia and Meta – members of the so-called Magnificent Seven – were among the most popular, richly valued US stocks, according to an analysis by Citigroup. All four have since become “crowded shorts” as investors have trimmed their exposure to and in some cases begun actively betting against their shares, Citi said in a note to clients this week. “Anyone who was all in on the [Magnificent Seven] has been hurt,” said JPMorgan’s Kelly. Trump himself has repeatedly dismissed the negative market reaction to some of his tariff announcements, and may have graded his first 100 days “on the basis of whether he’s done what he said he would, rather than on whether the results have so far been good or bad”, said Thierry Wizman, global foreign exchange and rates strategist at Macquarie. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Tesla sales fall while its stock rallies – what this tells us about perceptions of Elon Musk

University of Bath provides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. View all partners Electric vehicle maker Tesla recently shared the news of disappointing first-quarter results when its earnings report was weaker than most Wall Street analysts had expected. Tesla’s revenue had tumbled 9% and its profit was down 71%. Typically, this would result in a sharp decline in investor confidence and share prices. Tesla’s share prices have indeed dropped over 40% this year. But after the earnings report, Tesla’s stock rallied when CEO Elon Musk vowed to scale back his involvement with the US Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) and focus on Tesla instead. He said that he would spend a day or two a week on government matters at president Donald Trump’s request. In any case, Musk is a “special government employee”, which means he can work in that role for 130 days in a year. Assuming his role started on January 20 – Trump’s inauguration day – it would need to be terminated by the end of May had he continued to work five days a week. Tesla maintains that the slump in its earnings can be attributed to many factors, including concerns about supply chains and tariffs, as well as energy prices. But Musk’s unpopularity has probably affected sales, with his approval among consumers souring. There will be a multitude of factors at play that can explain Tesla’s decline. What is less ambiguous is the response of the market to Musk – just the fact that he said that he would devote time to Tesla rallied the investors. Apparently, the boss’s attention is highly valuable. To some extent, this is not surprising – what a CEO (or leader) chooses to focus on and what they ignore sets the tone within a firm. That said, it hardly seems to be the case that this is about setting a tone. Rather, the market (or the investors) seems to trust Musk. This is no mean feat for a CEO prone to engage in bluster. This investor trust contrasts with consumer trust and goodwill, which seem to be eroding at the same time. Musk has been called an absent CEO and analysts have noted that the demands on his time imply that he cannot be very active in running Tesla. Perhaps that is true. Or perhaps Musk thinks that Tesla is too big to fail and will be protected by the US government. Short-term bumps are less relevant for a firm that is pivoting away from its core business, as Tesla now appears to be doing. Musk has stated that Tesla is increasingly an AI and robotics company, saying this is where the firm believes the “future lies”. Setting aside energy, data is one of the most important resources powering AI. It is the key input for training large language models (LLMs) and machine algorithms. The quality of an AI algorithm is directly correlated with the data it trains on. The larger and more diverse the data set, the better (and more lucrative) the AI agent is likely to be. There seems to be substaintial overlap in the data that AI has been trained on, although details are closely guarded. In addition, there is a possibility of training data running out, which makes it an even more precious resource. Companies from OpenAI to Meta seem to be scraping the internet for the same publicly available information (while apparently ignoring copyright issues). Now Musk seems to have access to an unprecedented amount of data that is not available to his competitors. His department at Doge has reportedly pushed for access to sensitive social security information, for example, that includes dates of birth, citizenship status, income, addresses, other tax-related information. Musk-owned interests have also developed an LLM chatbot called Grok. And while Musk and his spokespeople deny that they have siphoned data for training AI models, there seems to be some indicators that this could potentially be done. It appears that Musk has manoeuvred himself into a position where, despite his unpopularity among car buyers, he can still ensure that his companies will thrive. But what does Trump get in return? After all, the president of the US considers himself a dealmaker. At least one analyst has suggested that Musk is the “fall guy” to take the hit when the Doge cuts begin to bite ordinary Americans. Regardless, it does appear that some sort of bargain has been struck between Musk and Trump. And it seems to be paying off for Musk – regulations around self-driving cars have been slashed, leading to another surge in the price of Tesla stock. Trump has also signed an executive order for AI education in primary and secondary schools. This is sure to increase the size of the market, which is clearly good news for companies in the AI sector. It would be foolish to underestimate the world’s richest man or to bet against him. But it’s important not to lionise CEOs to the extent that they become cult figures. In the Wealth of Nations, 18th-century Scottish economist Adam Smith made the point that the butcher, brewer and baker do not act from altruism. Instead, it is their own self-interest that puts food and drink on people’s tables. We are far better served keeping that in mind to make sense of the actions of Musk – or the investors in Tesla.
