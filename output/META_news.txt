Elon Musk, co-founder and CEO of Tesla Motors Inc.,(R) smiles during the GPU Technology Conference ... [+] in San Jose, California. Musk discussed with Jen-Hsun Huang, CEO of Nvidia Corp.,(L) his outlook and views on the future of autonomous cars. (Photo by Kim Kulish/Corbis via Getty Images) Will Nvidia’s growth rate keep slowing down? If so, investors may be wise to take their profits. However, if the AI chip designer’s new products spur faster growth, now might be a buying opportunity. Stock prices rise when companies exceed investor expectations and raise guidance and they drop if companies fall short on either one. Nvidia is no exception to this rule. To justify buying Nvidia stock now that it’s the most valuable company in the world — having enjoyed a 195% rise in its share price to a market capitalization of $3.5 trillion this year — you must believe the company will keep beating and raising. If Nvidia significantly exceeds conservative growth targets with help from Blackwell, the stock could rise despite slowing revenue growth, dependence on a few large customers, and the absence of a killer app to deliver a return on the rising investment needed to train and operate AI chatbots. Nvidia stock presents investors with significant risks. These include the following: My guess is investors are baking all these negatives into their expectations. Indeed, despite Nvidia’s slowing growth in 2024, the company’s stock has continued to rise. This could be because the company has been doing a good job of lowering investors’ growth expectations. Positive surprises to growth would keep Nvidia stock rising. Huge orders for the company’s latest chip line by the largest AI service providers — coupled with growing corporate interest in applying AI to make processes more efficient — could provide investors with unexpected good news. Here’s how: Until Nvidia can unlock faster-than-expected growth, its stock could be stuck in a trading range. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Goldman Sachs says these 11 stocks are next in line to benefit from the AI wave as Magnificent 7 dominance starts to fade
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/next-ai-stocks-to-buy-magnificent-7-growth-slows-goldman-2024-11
Time Published: 2024-11-24T10:07:02Z

This year, the AI story has dominated the stock market. Just seven stocks have fueled much of the market's rally: Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla. The Magnificent Seven have returned 148% since the end of 2022, drastically outperforming the 55% return for the rest of the S&P 500 index over that time. These tech behemoths have seen their earnings turbocharged by their market dominance in sectors such as cloud computing, software, and semiconductors. AI infrastructure stocks have also started to take off. Data-center stocks like Vertiv and Digital Realty have soared as the demand to build out AI capacity has risen. But now, so-called "Phase 3" AI stocks, which are rolling out the technology to increase their revenues, are set to shine, according to Goldman Sachs. 2025 will be the year of transition from investing in AI infrastructure to AI beneficiaries, Goldman's Chief US Equity Strategist David Kostin said. Two years after the debut of ChatGPT, more and more revenue-generating use cases for AI are emerging. "While Phase 2 stocks may continue to outperform the broad equity market, we expect returns will be earnings-driven and the risk/reward for new capital appears more attractive within Phase 3," Kostin and his team wrote in a recent note. After an incredible two-year rally, it's may be difficult to see the Magnificent Seven cooling off. The stocks have shown impressive earnings growth in the last year and have come to dominate the market, making up about 30% of the S&P 500 by market cap. However, the growth that placed them there isn't sustainable for the long term, Kostin said. That's not to say that the Magnificent Seven aren't solid companies. Goldman still expects them to outperform the rest of the index in 2025, but the bank is expecting them to do so by only 7%. For context, the Magnificent Seven outperformed the rest of the S&P 500 by 22% so far this year and 63% in 2023. Valuations for the market's biggest performers are overripe: the Magnificent Seven trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 30x, while the rest of the index trades at a modest 19x. That's where the AI Phase 3 trade comes in. These companies, whose revenues and earnings are set to get a boost from AI implementation, are valued much more reasonably, with the typical Phase 3 company trading at only 0.1 standard deviations more expensive than average, compared to 0.5 for Phase 2. Valuations for Phase 3 stocks are depressed due to a recent decreased enthusiasm for AI, as some market experts have been questioning if AI is a trillion-dollar bubble ready to pop, according to Goldman Sachs. Lower expectations for Phase 3 stocks isn't necessarily a bad thing, though — it makes it easier for these companies to beat investor expectations and increase their share price. On the other hand, expectations for Nvidia have risen so high that the stock still fell in after-hours trading in the wake of consensus-beating Q3 revenue performance. "The share price performance of the companies in the infrastructure basket has dramatically outpaced their trajectory of earnings growth," Kostin said of Phase 2 companies. On the other hand, companies in the AI-enabled revenue group have seen share price growth in line with earnings growth. "And so our analysis is there's potential for multiple expansion in those stocks," Kostin added. To find companies likely to see enhanced revenues from AI, Goldman Sachs analyzed recent messaging from company management regarding AI rollout. The bank identified the following 11 companies adopting AI to enhance their revenues as well as recent commentary from Q3 earnings calls indicating increased AI usage. Ticker: ACVA Earnings commentary: "Our appraisal solutions incorporate AI imaging for damage detection and real-time localized pricing that is condition-enhanced, based on millions of inspections in our data mode. It's still early days in this category, but we believe self-inspection can unlock a number of long-term growth opportunities, including TAM expansion." Ticker: CVLT Earnings commentary: "And with our recent Clumio acquisition, we're bringing innovative recovery capabilities to Amazon S3. This depth is paramount as many organizations rely on S3 to store large data and growing AI datasets." Ticker: NET Earnings commentary: "A rapidly growing AI company expanded their relationship with Cloudflare, signing a one-year, $7 million pool of funds contract for Workers AI. This company signed a $500,000 contract in Q2 for Cloudflare to be their 'platform for AI for inference, storage, image optimization and application security.' They quickly recognized the value of our platform and are now moving all of their workloads over to make Cloudflare their single inference cloud platform. With Workers AI, this customer is able to improve cost efficiency with our pay per inference model and also eliminate the need for a dedicated team to run and manage their infrastructure." Ticker: DDOG Earnings Commentary: "At the end of Q3, about 3,000 customers used one or more Datadog AI integrations to send us data about their AI, machine learning, and LLM usage. As some of these experiments start turning into production AI applications, we are seeing initial signs of traction for our LLM Observability product. Now, some of our growth is coming from AI-native customers, who this quarter represented more than 6% of our Q3 ARR, up from more than 4% in Q2 and about 2.5% of our ARR in the year-ago quarter." Ticker: DOCN Earnings commentary: "Revenue growth remained steady in the third quarter at 12% year over year, with solid performance in Core Cloud and continued growth in AI despite lapping difficult comps from our managed hosting price increase in April 2023 and from the Paperspace acquisition in July 2023. We continue to see momentum in demand for our AI/ML products, where Q3 ARR again grew close to 200% year-over-year." Ticker: DT Earnings commentary: "We closed a seven-figure expansion with a leading finance management platform. This customer had limited visibility into the thousands of incidents occurring in their production environment. They estimated that these incidents were costing them hundreds of thousands of dollars. By extending Dynatrace's AI-driven platform into their production environment, they gained substantive visibility and resultant business value." Ticker: FTNT Earnings commentary: "AI Security Operation was a fast-growing pillar, outpacing the overall market with 32% billings growth, accounting for 10.5% of our total business, up 2 points." Ticker: IT Earnings commentary: "We see great demand from our clients on the issues you'd expect, so like cybersecurity, how do they use artificial intelligence, data and analytics." Ticker: HUBS Earnings commentary: "Our strategy is to embed AI into every hub and across the entire platform and democratize AI for scaling companies. Since the launch, we have seen a notable increase in AI awareness, adoption and usage. AI app awareness within HubSpot grew by 13% quarter-over-quarter with two-thirds of Enterprise and half of Pro customers engaging with AI features. Copilot, our AI assistant, has resonated well, particularly with Starter customers who use it to summarize CRM data and objects, rewrite text and generate insights from their customer data. Copilot is now in public beta, and we are seeing repeat usage with 43% of users, which is a strong start." Ticker: MA Earnings commentary: "We've now boosted the product with GenAI and the outcome that we see is tremendous. This is up to a 20% lift that we see. Now these are solutions that our customers opt in to because they like those solutions, and they like the lift that they get out of that." Ticker: NOW Earnings commentary: "ServiceNow has emerged as the AI platform for business transformation. The secular shift to AI is validated and is unfolding in real time. With Now Assist, we have 44 customers spending more than $1 million in ACV, including six over $5 million, and two over $10 million, and this continues to be our fastest-growing product ever, and an accelerant to our cross-enterprise expansion."

Samsung's second-tier OLED (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of WIRED reviewer Ryan Waniata’s favorite TVs of the year. This QD-OLED panel boasts fabulously rich colors, can get slightly brighter than the LG C4, and has the perfect black levels and excellent picture quality from any angle that make OLED the dominant TV tech today. This TV has HDMI 2.1 support across all four inputs, and Samsung's Game Hub lets you stream from loads of services, including Xbox. The only obvious downside is the lack of Dolby Vision. You can find more options in our Best Early Black Friday TV Deals. Perhaps the best 4K streamer for folks who watch loads of Amazon Prime shows and movies, this Fire Stick is very easy to set up and use, supports Wi-Fi 6E for fast and stable streaming, and packs 16 gigabytes of storage. Alexa is built into the remote to help you find content or ask questions about what you’re watching. The picture-in-picture mode is handy for showing security cameras or controlling other smart home devices. There's also “Ambient Experience,” which cycles through art or nature scenes on your TV when you’re not watching something. The latest Apple Watch Series 10 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best Apple Watch you can buy. It is an excellent fitness and health tracker, brings phone notifications and calls to your wrist, and works wonderfully well in concert with your iPhone. Sadly, it lacks blood oxygen sensing, and you'll still need to charge it every night. We don't see many deals on Apple's latest wares, so this is a discount worth grabbing if you're set on an Apple Watch. The Apple MacBook Air (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite Apple laptop. WIRED reviewer Brenda Stolyar says it offers great performance for everyday tasks, has a bright display, and provides solid battery life. This lightweight device is the MacBook pick in our Best Laptops guide. The 15-inch model is also on sale at $1,044 ($255 off) and has a bigger display, better battery life, and more speakers, but is otherwise identical. These are the best trackers for folks with an iPhone, and you can use them to keep tabs on your keys, travel luggage, bike, or whatever else you worry might go missing. The location of each AirTag is marked clearly in the Find My app. The battery should last you a year, and we have a guide on how to replace your AirTag battery. Just please don’t use them to track people. This excellent 3-in-1 charger for your iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch is one of the best MagSafe chargers around. You can fold it away to a very compact size, making it an ideal travel companion. Charging for your iPhone goes up to 15 watts via a magnetic pad that can adjust to your preferred angle. There’s another pad for AirPods or other wireless earbuds, and a fold-out Apple Watch charger on the back. A 5-foot USB-C cable and wall adapter are included. This is one of our favorite wireless chargers, but it is expensive, so this sale might be the perfect time to grab one. We recommend springing for the Qi2 version, as it will be compatible with the wave of Qi2 Android phones coming in 2025, but it also works with MagSafe iPhones (iPhone 13 models and newer support the Qi2 protocol). If you're just an iPhone person, the standard MagSafe version of this charger is also on sale for $77 ($33 off). Check out our Nomad Black Friday sale post for more deals. Tacto is an app with physical pieces that convert your iPad, Android, or Fire tablet into a game board. With Tacto Chess, your kids can learn the basics, from how the pieces move to strategies for victory. The animated app features friendly voice acting and stories, chess puzzles to solve, a move predictor, and your child can play against AI or another person. My kids had some fun with this when they were learning, and it helped them understand chess a little better. This appears in our best STEM toys for kids guide. My quest to find the best portable chargers has led me to test hundreds of power banks, but this is my current favorite. I love the look of this transparent, prism-shaped device, but it’s also extremely useful with a maximum output of 170 watts and a 24,000-mAh capacity, not to mention tough, with an IP66 rating for water resistance. It will fast-charge just about any small gadget, from phones to laptops, and the handy wee display shows battery life as a percentage, time remaining, and the input or output in watts. I have once seen it slightly cheaper, but this is a good price. As a fan of the translucent electronics craze in the 1990s, I was immediately smitten to this power bank. You can see the ports, chips, and rechargeable Samsung Li-ion batteries inside. While an even better Shargeek (now Sharge) device replaced this in our best portable chargers guide, this power bank is still great. A color display shows the voltage, current, and power flowing in or out, and you can dig deeper for more stats. The DC barrel port lets you specify voltage and current for different devices, up to 75 watts, the first USB-C supports PD PPS up to 100 watts, the second offers 30 watts and supports PD 3.0 and Quick Charge 4 standards, and the USB-A port is QC 3.0 at up to 18 watts. The Qi2 wireless charging standard was developed in partnership with Apple and features MagSafe-like magnetic alignment and speedier iPhone charging rates of up to 15 watts. This power bank can also charge other Qi2 devices (when they appear) and existing Qi devices (just more slowly). This compact power bank also has a handy kickstand, a two-way USB-C port, and an LED display that shows power and time to charge. You can attach MagSafe iPhones in portrait or landscape orientation, and it works with Apple’s StandBy mode, making it one of the best MagSafe power banks. The Anker 737 is the upgrade pick in our best portable chargers guide. With a whopping 24,000 mAh capacity, support for power delivery 3.1, and the ability to send or receive up to 140 watts, this is the only power bank you need. It weighs nearly 1.4 pounds but is fairly compact, considering how much power it holds. A smart digital display shows battery percentage, and you can tap the power button to cycle through stats, including the temperature, total output, and more. This versatile portable charger fast-charged everything I tested and can easily juice up three devices at once. The first portable power station from DJI can put out 2,200 watts steadily (2,600 watts surge), has two USB-C PD 3.1 ports (140 watts), and has DJI’s proprietary SDC ports for fast-charging drone batteries. It can charge phones, power microwaves or small tools, and meet most of your portable power needs, but it’s an especially great choice for folks with DJI drones, because it can fast-charge most models. It gets a little noisy with a lot of gadgets charging, and cable and bag accessories cost extra, but it still claims a place in our Best Portable Power Stations guide. Durable and versatile, this power bank slips easily into a bag and has a nice grippy, textured finish. The yellow is easy to spot in a crowded tent, and the segmented LED shows the remaining power in blocks of 10 percent. The Charge 100 Max can charge up to five gadgets at once, and the wireless charging pad on top is handy in the dark when you don’t want to fumble with cables. This is the outdoors pick in our Best Portable Chargers guide. The Mill food recycler just might be one of the most idiot-proof ways out there to dispatch food waste for those who don’t have access to municipal compost. Throw in food scraps (even meat!) and the Mill grinds and dries them into odorless, shelf-stable bits overnight. There used to be a subscription program where you sent the grounds off in the mail to be made into chicken feed, but it looks like that’s been axed in favor of using your grounds in the garden. We didn’t have the greatest success with that when we reviewed it earlier this year (6/10 WIRED Review), but we did find it to be a great device overall. This is Mill’s first-ever Black Friday sale, so if you were on the fence, this is the time to give it a shot. (Mill also offers a 90-day trial with free returns if you change your mind.) —Kat Merck As seen in our guide to the Best White Elephant Gifts, this funny little tumbler holds both cereal and milk separately to be enjoyed on the go without the cereal becoming soggy. There is a learning curve—small, spherical cereal bits like Cheerios work best; you must block part of the milk hole with your lower lip lest the milk flow outpace the cereal flow; and the whole contraption tends to leak if the lid isn’t twisted on at exactly the right angle. However, it’s available in seven different colors and makes a great gag gift or stocking stuffer for someone who either loves cereal or never has time to eat breakfast. —Kat Merck The best smart shades can be awfully expensive, but this clever retrofit gadget from Eve can make one of your existing roller blinds smart. Simply check compatibility by measuring the circumference of the tube inside your roller shade. This kit works with Matter, so you can use it with your platform of choice, but you do need a home hub (with Apple HomeKit, for example, that is a HomePod mini, HomePod, or Apple TV) if you want to schedule it to open and close automatically or use voice commands. Mine works perfectly, and I love the handy pull chain as a simple control backup, but it can be a little noisy. One of the cheapest and best Govee smart lights you can buy is this affordable light strip that comes in several lengths. It is designed to be hidden behind furniture, so you just see the reflected light. We are highlighting the longest 100-foot option here, but all are segmented to display multiple colors, can be controlled wirelessly from the app or using voice controls, and support Govee’s enormous variety of lighting effects. These light strips also appear in our best smart lighting guide. This is one of the best sales we’ve seen on this boxy air purifier, which I’ve had in my kitchen for over two years now to mitigate some of the combustion particulates from my gas stove. I love that the slim profile and rectangular shape make this purifier easy to tuck away somewhere unobtrusive (though it still does need to be located 8 inches away from a wall), and that its HEPA replacement filters are both easy to find and inexpensive (Amazon has them for $26 for two). WIRED reviewer Lisa Wood Shapiro also notes in our guide to the Best Air Purifiers that it has an excellent air exchange rate for small rooms, cleaning the air in 361 square feet at the recommended rate of 4.8 times per hour. —Kat Merck The Airmega 250 from clean air leader Coway provides the industrial vibe your home or loft needs. The warm gray box looks like a high-end speaker. And the Airmega 250 can do four air exchanges an hour when fitted for a 465-square-foot room. Utilizing a HEPA filter, this CARB-certified air purifier also has a washable prefilter along with an activated carbon filter to capture odors and VOCs. It has a built-in air quality sensor with indicator light and an easy-to-use control panel. It’s not app-compatible but does have a three-year warranty and runs at a relatively quiet 22 decibels. —Lisa Wood Shapiro This cylindrical air purifier covers 2,745 square feet (at an air exchange rate of two times per hour, less than the recommended four, so we’d recommend a room half that size) with a 4-in-1 filter consisting of pre-filter, HEPA, activated carbon, and an antibacterial layer. Bosch came out with the Air line of Energy Star- and CARB-certified air purifiers this summer, including small, medium, and large versions. Look for this large version in our guide to the Best Air Purifiers. I’ve been using it on the 1,300-square-foot main floor of my house that has 23-foot ceilings, and the difference in smells, dust, and overall air quality has been extremely noticeable. It’s got a ring-light indicator (red = bad, blue = good) as well as a digital display that shows PM 2.5, total volatile organic compounds, temperature, and humidity. It’s also imperceptibly quiet with the fan running on the lowest speed. The only downside is the expensive filters that must be replaced every six to nine months. —Kat Merck For folks with smaller homes, the Dyson V12 Detect Slim (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite Dyson vacuum. It is very lightweight, easy to maneuver, and will pack away in a small space. It is also effective at keeping your place pristine, with a wide assortment of attachments to help you get into nooks and crannies. It even has a neon-green laser to shine a spotlight on every speck of dust you may have missed. As one of the best sleep trackers, the Withings Sleep Analyzer tracks your movements, breathing, and heart rate throughout the night, sending data to the Withings Health Mate app. Each morning you can review your sleep phases, broken into awake, REM, light, and deep sleep, and get a sleep score out of 100 based on duration, depth, regularity, interruptions, time to fall asleep, and time to get up. This mat slips under your mattress, making it a great sleep-tracking option for folks who don’t like to wear watches or rings in bed. This affordable security camera is our pick of the best indoor security cameras because it offers clear 2K footage, with a starlight sensor that enables color night vision. Smart detection (people, pets, and vehicles) is handy, and the slightly laggy two-way audio is fine. Pop in a microSD card (up to 512 GB) for local recording, or opt for a Tapo Care subscription for 30 days of cloud storage that starts at $3.50 per month. It also has an IP66 rating, so it can be used outdoors. What makes this one of the best indoor security cameras you can buy is the face recognition. It can warn you when there’s a stranger in your home and tell you when your kids or partner get in. With HDR, the 1080p video quality is crystal clear at 30 fps, and there’s automatic night vision when it’s dark. You also get decent two-way audio and enforced two-factor authentication, which is important for an indoor camera. The big downside is that you need a Nest Aware subscription costing $8 per month ($80/year) for 30 days of event video history and familiar face alerts, but that covers all your Nest devices. There are so many good-quality, affordable security cameras on the market, and the Blink Mini 2 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorites. It can record 1080p footage at up to 30 fps, offers decent low-light performance, and boasts on-device person detection. The catch is the subscription at $3 per month or $30 per year for a single camera, but it nets you a generous 60-day unlimited cloud video history. This camera is ideal for sitting unobtrusively on a shelf and keeping an eye on your home when you are away. This Arlo model has everything you need in an indoor security camera, including crisp 2K video at 24 frames per second, two-way audio, and a compact design that includes a privacy shutter. You can expect a quick loading feed in the Arlo app, useful smart notifications, and two-factor authentication, so you can log in with your fingerprint or face if your phone allows. Sadly, you need a pricey subscription (Arlo Secure costs $8 per month for one camera or $13 per month for unlimited cameras) for subject recognition, smart alerts, and cloud storage. This is the upgrade pick in our best indoor security cameras guide. Arlo ticks all the boxes with crisp 2K video, a wide 160-degree field of view, two-way audio, and a direct connection to Wi-Fi. That’s why the Arlo Pro 5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) tops our best outdoor security cameras guide. The Arlo app is swift to load, offers excellent notifications, and supports two-factor authentication, so you can log in with your fingerprint or face, phone permitting. The catch is a pricey subscription (Arlo Secure costs $8 per month for one camera or $13 per month for unlimited cameras) that’s required for subject recognition, smart alerts, and cloud storage. This versatile device is the pan-and-tilt pick in our best outdoor security camera guide. It’s ideal if you want a hands-off camera you can set up and leave to do its thing. The built-in solar panel keeps the battery topped off. The camera features a dual-lens system with a main lens that boasts a 135-degree field of view and records sharp video, paired with a telephoto lens that offers 3x zoom in the center of the frame (it goes up to 8x hybrid zoom). There’s also 8 GB of storage built-in to keep things local. The relatively low 15 fps frame rate is disappointing, and the two-way audio quality is not great, but there is onboard AI and subject tracking. A security camera kit is an easy way to get started with home security, and this Eufy one includes two cameras with a home hub. The upgrade pick for folks seeking a local, subscription-free system in our best outdoor security cameras guide, the EufyCam 3 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) has a lot going for it. Solar is built-in for battery top-ups, video resolution goes all the way up to 4K, and there's 16 GB of local storage (expandable up to 16 TB) on the connected HomeBase 3 hub. You also get on-device people, pet, and vehicle recognition, and this system can even recognize familiar faces, though it’s not as good at it as Google’s Nest cams. While it’s not our top pick, Google’s Nest Cam does make our list of the best outdoor security cameras and is a solid choice if you have a Nest Doorbell or other Google gadgets. The HD resolution is limited, but that’s offset by the HDR and high frame rate, and the face recognition is the best we have tested in a security camera. The Nest Aware subscription at $8 a month ($80/year) is too much if you only have a single camera, but that price covers multiple devices. Folks who receive loads of packages will appreciate Eufy’s dual camera doorbell because it provides a view of your porch floor and front step, alongside the usual picture of whoever is calling. This is the best subscription-free option in our best video doorbells guide because there’s 8 GB of built-in storage for local recording, and it can connect to a HomeBase 3 hub for more. The 2K footage is crisp and clear, and there’s on-device people, package, and even face detection, though it’s not always accurate, and this doorbell can be laggy when connecting away from home. With a pleasing range of adjustments, including seat depth, recline level, and armrest length, this dependable office chair is easy to assemble. It can serve you well, no matter what height you are, and even boasts adjustable lumbar support, which is essential for folks who sit for hours every day. This is the lowest price we have seen yet on the best office chair for most people. Use code BFCM for 15 percent off. You can find more bargains in the Branch Black Friday sale. Simple to set up and use, Amazon's Eero mesh systems are easy to recommend and can act as smart home hubs with support for Matter, Thread, and Zigbee. The tri-band Eero Pro 6E (7/10, WIRED Recommends) mesh adds the 6-GHz band to the familiar 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz bands. It’s a great choice for busy households with many devices and a 1-Gbps or faster connection. Performance is excellent, but the 6-GHz band is short-range. The Eero Plus subscription is expensive ($10 per month or $100 per year), but it includes comprehensive parental controls, advanced security, ad blocking, and even a password manager and VPN service. Folks with smaller homes and connections up to 500 Mbps should consider the Eero 6 (3-Pack) on sale at $150 ($50 off), but the more heavily discounted Eero 6+ (3-Pack) at $195 ($105 off) is a better deal if you can afford it. This TP-Link mesh will cover your whole home on a limited budget (it’s the budget pick in our best mesh routers guide). It is a Wi-Fi 6 dual-band mesh (2.4-GHz and 5-GHz) that is easy to set up. It’s not the speediest mesh, but is fast enough for folks with internet connections of 500 Mbps or less. The vase-like design blends in easily on shelves or tables, and each router sports two gigabit Ethernet ports. For more than basic security and parental controls, you need Security+ at $5 a month or $36 a year, and Advanced Parental Controls at $3 a month or $18 a year). But, even with the subscriptions, the X20 is an affordable way to get reliable Wi-Fi. The Deco BE85 (7/10, WIRED Review) was TP-Link's first Wi-Fi 7 mesh. It delivers unrivaled performance, wide coverage, and is easy to set up and use. A two-pack will be enough for most folks, and each router has two 10-Gbps Ethernet ports, two 2.5-Gbps ports, and a USB 3.0 port. You need a very fast multi-gig internet connection and loads of Wi-Fi 7 devices to make this a worthwhile purchase, but it has dropped in price significantly since release. We recommended this Wi-Fi 6E system in our best mesh routers guide until it was replaced by the newer XE70 Pro, but this is still a good choice, especially with the discount. It is a tri-band (2.4-GHz, 5-GHz, and 6-GHz) mesh with impressive range and stability. Each of the three routers has three Gigabit ports. By default, the 6-GHz band is reserved for wireless backhaul, but you can open it up for devices. If you have a connection of 1 Gbps or less, this mesh will serve you well. While enhanced security and parental controls require subscriptions, most folks can live without them. Topping our best routers guide, this affordable router combines a slick design with reliable performance. It’s only a dual-band (2.4-GHz and 5-GHz) router, but should be fast enough for most folks and will cover an average-sized home with an internet connection of 1 Gbps or less. Ample connectivity includes four gigabit Ethernet LAN ports, a single gigabit WAN port, and a USB 3.0 port on the back. The setup is simple, TP-Link’s Tether app is easy to use, and basic security and features like QoS (Quality of Service) are included. If you want the top-of-the-line mesh system from Amazon’s Eero, it’s the Max 7. This tri-band system supports the latest Wi-Fi 7 standard. Each router can cover up to 2,500 square feet, and they have four Ethernet ports apiece, two rated at 10 Gbps and two at 2.5 Gbps. You can mix and match Eero routers, the app is very accessible, and this system is designed to be hands-off. It also boasts comprehensive smart home connectivity, and the optional Eero Plus subscription is pricey ($10 per month or $100 per year) but bundles parental controls, enhanced security, ad blocking, a password manager, and VPN service. Eero has worked out some of the kinks since I tested the Max 7 (7/10, WIRED Review), but it’s still likely overkill for most folks and more than you need to spend unless you have a big busy household with a multi-gig internet connection. Gamers don’t need a special gaming router, but if you love customizable RGB lighting, this mesh will tempt you. It’s not just fancy lighting that makes it worth a look, because this tri-band Asus ROG Rapture GT6 finished high up the table in most tests. With a single 2.4-GHz band and two 5-GHz bands (one is used for backhaul unless you connect the routers with an Ethernet cable), it can keep all your gaming gear online. The 5-GHz band supports wider 160-MHz channels and WPA3 for security. You also get AiProtection security software and comprehensive parental controls included without a subscription. The game modes boost performance and prioritize gaming traffic, and each router has a 2.5 Gbps WAN port, three 1 gigabit LAN ports, and a USB 3.2 Gen 1 port. The best Wi-Fi 6E router in our best routers guide, this hexagonal Asus router impressed in my tests. It’s a tri-band router, adding the 6-GHz band to the familiar 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz. The new band is very fast, though it is relatively low range and doesn’t penetrate through walls very well. There’s ample connectivity with a 2.5-Gbps WAN/LAN port, a second 1-Gbps WAN/LAN, and a further three gigabit LANs. Asus also offers free security and parental controls and all the settings you need in the mobile app and browser interface, including band-splitting, prioritization for different activities, guest network, VPN support, and so on. Some of the best wire-free earbuds you can get for under $100, the Anker Soundcore Space A40 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) impressed WIRED reviewer Ryan Waniata with noise cancellation, detailed sound, multipoint pairing, and a wireless charging case at a very reasonable price. These earbuds are regularly discounted, but this is close to the lowest price we’ve seen. You can shrug off battery anxiety with the HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless (10/10, WIRED Recommends), because this gaming headset can go for an amazing 300 hours between charges. Former WIRED reviewer Eric Ravenscraft said it delivers rich, booming sound, has comfortable ear cups, and boasts intuitive controls. All it really lacks is a headphone jack. Discounts are common on this headset, and it may have dipped slightly lower, but this is still a bargain worth grabbing. We think Amazon’s Audible Premium Plus is the best audiobook service, as it bundles a library of Audible Originals, audiobooks, and podcasts, with one credit per month to use on any audiobook title you fancy, and regular exclusive deals and discounts. Usually, you get one month free, after which it costs $15 per month, but any nonsubscriber can get three months for $1 until the end of the year. Remember that you get to keep titles purchased with credits, even after your subscription ends. Some people (like me) have stubborn hair that will only straighten with a flat iron, but others with more forgiving hair have a wider breadth of options, from hot brushes to air-assisted tools like Dyson’s AirWrap. Yet another method is via the Tymo Ring, a straightening comb that former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano called in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners a way to take “the curl right out quickly—I didn't have to go over sections more than once or twice.” She also liked the outer shell that covers the hot teeth, so users are able to get closer to their roots without burning themselves. —Kat Merck Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano declared this uniquely shaped hair dryer as “made for curls” in our Best Hair Dryers guide. Basically a diffuser and dryer in one, it’s designed to dry curls gently while cutting down on frizz and puffiness. It doesn’t have a traditional handle, but that didn’t bother Medea. If you’re short on space in your bathroom and don’t want to have to store a hair dryer and separate diffuser attachment, this could be the solution for you. —Kat Merck As seen in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, WIRED reviewer Nena Farrell is a fan of this two-in-one tourmaline ceramic hair straightener and curler that ranges from 284 to 428 degrees Fahrenheit. The unique barrel has 88 little holes that blow cool air with the touch of a button, supposedly helping to set styles to last up to 48 hours. Nena did not find that her hair stayed curlier or straighter after using this feature, but this is still a decent deal on a unique tool for someone who may not want to have to store both a curling iron and a flat iron. —Kat Merck This OG Chi is an oldie but a goodie—even though it’s got ceramic plates and only heats up to 392 degrees Fahrenheit, it’s able to successfully smooth a broad range of hair types and textures. It’s lightweight, with 1-inch plates for easy maneuverability and waves, plus it’s got three heat settings and one-hour auto-shutoff for safety. I had one of these straighteners decades ago and it lasted nearly 10 years. Even though this isn’t the greatest sale I’ve ever seen, I still wouldn’t hesitate to buy it again. —Kat Merck I go through a lot of heat protectants while testing hair straighteners, and R+Co Bleu’s Hypersonic Heat Styling Mist is one of my go-tos. It protects up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (also great for hair dryers and curling irons) and goes on kind of thick, like hairspray, so it’s definitely effective at fighting frizz but also isn’t so heavy that it weighs hair down. I also like that it comes in sustainable packaging and is Leaping Bunny certified to be cruelty-free. All of R+Co’s products are 30 percent off for Black Friday, so R+Co’s diatomaceous earth-based Skyline Dry Shampoo is also worth a grab if you need a TSA-compliant dry shampoo for travel or are trying to stay away from aerosols. And on the subject of hair products, IGK is also offering 30 percent off everything on its site, and while testing for an upcoming guide to the Best Heat Protectants we’ve also become quite fond of IGK’s Good Behavior Smoothing Spray (protects up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit), which is $10 off in the sale. —Kat Merck There are hair straighteners that are best for thick and curly hair and hair straighteners that are best for finer, more wavy hair, but it’s rare to find one that works great for both. As the top pick in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, this ceramic iron makes short work of most hair textures—former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano has one she’s been using on her curls since college, and this is the iron I use on my own unruly 3a curls for daily touch-ups. I also like the maneuverability of the smaller plates and the quick one-minute heating time. —Kat Merck We love Cozy Earth’s bamboo sheets and hoodies, but this pajama set hits new comfort highs—soft and stretchy, smooth and luxurious. My wife has been wearing these pajamas to test them for an upcoming gift guide, and she says they are the best she has ever worn. The big catch with Cozy Earth clothing is the high prices, so this Black Friday sale offering up to 35 percent off is worth a look. The sale price is only on select colors of these pajamas. The Google Pixel 9 Pro (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorite phones of the year. WIRED Senior Reviews Editor Julian Chokkattu raves about the camera system, smooth OLED displays, and helpful software features you won’t find on other phones. Easily one of the best Android phones you can buy right now, the Pixel 9 Pro only dropped recently, so this is a surprisingly deep and tempting discount. The Pixel 8A is also discounted at $399 ($100 off). This 10-foot cable is long enough to allow you to place your phone where you want while charging (or continue using it without having to crouch near the outlet). It is a durable braided nylon cable from Anker that comes with a lifetime warranty. It can deliver up to 100 watts to fast-charge any phone or tablet and comes with a handy cable tie. You can get it in black or white, but I like the red because it stands out, making it less of a tripping hazard. This is the best long cable in our best USB-C cables guide. The Google Pixel Watch 3 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is a good-looking smartwatch with accurate health and fitness capabilities. The bigger 45-mm size offers a day or more of battery life, and the Auto Bedtime Mode is handy when the day is over. This is our pick of the best smartwatches if you have an Android phone, and this is the lowest price we have seen for it yet. Discounts on Oura’s biohacking smart rings are rare, but the Oura Ring Gen3 Horizon dropped in price when the Oura Ring 4 landed, and this discount takes it even lower. This smart ring is our favorite sleep tracker and does a solid job of tracking your activity and stress levels. It packs three hospital-grade sensors: infrared photoplethysmography sensors for heart rate and respiration, a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) sensor for body temperature, and a 3D accelerometer for movement. The app is easy to use, but Oura’s $6-per-month membership is an essential extra cost to get the most from this gadget. This easy-to-build home arcade cabinet features a 17-inch color LCD screen, a light-up marquee, authentic arcade controls, and runs 14 Namco games, including every version of Pac-Man and a few extras like Galaga and Dig Dug. Whether you grew up in the arcades or not, these games still have a powerful addictive hook, and this Pac-Man arcade machine brought me closer to my teen kids. This is a decent discount that drops it to the lowest price we’ve seen. This is one of the best game controllers for PC gamers, with five central buttons on the front, a pair of rear paddles, and plenty of customization options. 8BitDo’s software lets you remap buttons, tweak the stick and trigger sensitivity, assign macros, and tune the vibration intensity. It’s compact with a grippy texture on the handles, satisfyingly clicky triggers, and a decent D-pad. There’s a 2.4G dongle in the handy charging dock for PC gaming, and battery life is around 20 hours. It also has Bluetooth support for Nintendo Switch players, making this a solid alternative to the Switch Pro controller. REI's Half Dome tents are some of the best camping tents you can buy, according to WIRED reviewer Scott Gilbertson, who says this tent is reasonably priced, rugged, and simple to set up, and it offers generous living space for two with gear. The interchangeable poles make for an easy pitch, and it won't add too much weight to your pack, at just under 4 pounds. Happy campers will find more options in our Best REI Black Friday Deals post. Now is the time to procure the best face computer. The Ray-Ban Meta sunglasses are on sale across Meta, Ray-Ban, Best Buy, Target, and Amazon through December 2. I freaking love these things (possibly because I’ve been wearing Ray-Ban Wayfarers for almost two decades) and they’re so useful. You can listen to podcasts on your run! You can take pictures to text to your spouse! You can check if the food cart is open, all without taking out your phone. And as if that weren’t enough, they also shade your eyes. —Adrienne So Universal travel adapters are handy to have on your travels and this affordable adapter from Epicka works in more than 150 countries. Sliders reveal common international plugs for the EU, UK, and US, but you can rotate the pins for sockets in Australia or China. You can plug in power-hungry devices, like laptops and camera batteries, but there are also four USB-A ports on the bottom and a 15-watt USB-C port on the side for phones, tablets, smartwatches, and other small gadgets. It’s not the sturdiest option, but it's cheaper than most of the alternatives. This is the budget pick in our best travel adapters guide and is frequently discounted, but well worth buying at this price. It's described as a men’s travel backpack, but we think anyone will find this bag useful for all kinds of trips. WIRED reviewer Louryn Strampe has been using it for six years and loves the storable backpack straps, padded handles, and plethora of pockets. She says it is comfortable and breathable if you're carrying it on your back, and it sports a padded compartment for your laptop, tablet, e-reader, or Nintendo Switch. This may have dipped a couple of bucks lower before. An honorable mention in our guide to the Best Toiletry Bags, this toiletry kit is a decent option for those who want a simple, well-made bag that can either hang or lay flat. There’s a snap-in plastic envelope for soap or a toothbrush, and the navy version I tested is made from recycled bottles. I wasn’t especially impressed with the bag’s organizational components in comparison to its size, and I didn’t like that the bag’s thick, small plastic hook couldn’t hang on a towel rack, but otherwise, I had no major complaints during my weeks of testing. It should also be noted this bag comes in almost 20 different colors and prints, from metallic pink to a basketball motif, so at this price it would make a great gift for adults and kids alike. —Kat Merck This super svelte smart wallet is durable and provides easy and swift access to your cards, thanks to a trigger button that pops them out of the top. It is made from recycled aluminum and holds four regular cards easily, though you can add more cards or cash using the band around the outside. Ekster also offers a ton of optional add-ons, including a tracker card and a multi-tool. I also love the Ekster Wallet at $62 ($27 off), and the Ekster Grid Backpack for $180 ($45 off) was the perfect way to travel light on my last work trip. Read next Read next

Title: Justices dismiss Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data breach dispute

This morning the justices dismissed Facebook v. Amalgamated Bank as “improvidently granted” – that is, without issuing a ruling on the merits, and instead signaling that it was a mistake to grant review. The brief unsigned order leaves in place a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit that allowed a securities fraud class action against Meta to go forward on the theory that Facebook’s disclosures improperly downplayed the risks of a data breach to shareholders. The company had disclosed the risk of hypothetical future data breaches, which shareholders argue violated securities law because Cambridge Analytica had already exploited the data of millions of users. When Cambridge’s misuse of user data later became widely known, Facebook’s stock price fell dramatically. At the oral argument, even the more conservative justices seemed skeptical of Facebook’s arguments, so its failure to persuade a majority to rein in the lower court is not surprising. At this point, the case will return to the lower courts, where the action will proceed against Meta.

Title: Warner Music Tumbles After Results Show Streaming Slows

(Bloomberg) -- Warner Music Group Corp. stock dropped the most in 18 months after the company reported disappointing fourth-quarter results and said streaming growth stalled. The record label reported net income of $48 million in the three months ended Sept. 30, down 69% from a year earlier. Revenue rose 2.8% to $1.63 billion, beating the $1.59 billion expected by analysts. Recorded music streaming revenue increased 2.1% in the quarter, a significant slowdown from the 9.6% growth in the same period a year earlier and softer than some analysts expected. The shares fell as much as 11% to $29.96 in New York after the results were released but recovered much of those losses later in the day. They were down 5.9% at 2:53 p.m. Warner Music and its larger rival Universal Music Group NV have both been grappling with investors concerns over a slowdown in streaming growth. UMG stock got walloped in July after second-quarter results showed a deceleration in subscription revenue, which it attributed to a slowdown in subscriber growth at some platforms and as Meta Platforms Inc. stopped licensing premium music videos for Facebook. Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. also aren’t signing up a lot of new customers. Investors have known the streaming boom has been over for a while, but seeing the effects in the numbers has spooked Wall Street. Warner Music also said the end of its music distribution deal with BMG would weigh on financial results next year. In September, BMG, a unit of Germany’s Bertelsmann, said it would handle its digital distribution in-house, ending its nearly 8-year deal with WMG. In the first quarter, “streaming growth will be impacted by the BMG digital distribution roll-off, the digital license renewal in the prior year, and the lapping of Spotify price increases,” Bryan Castellani, chief financial officer of Warner Music Group, said on a call with analysts to discuss results. “Our digital distribution relationship with BMG that was planned to roll off by the end of fiscal ‘24 will now continue into fiscal ‘25.” That will affect revenue in the first quarter by about $16 million, he said. Recorded Music revenue was up 3.6% to $1.34 billion, in the fourth quarter, however the end of the distribution agreement with BMG resulted in $25 million less revenue compared with a year earlier, the company said. A renewal with one of the company’s digital partners also resulted in a $4 million “unfavorable impact” on recorded music streaming revenue. Music publishing revenue fell 1% to $295 million, missing analysts expectations of $313 million. (Updates with streaming revenue in third paragraph.)

Title: Stock market today: Dow soars 461 points while Nasdaq wavers as tech shares slip

Indexes ended higher on Thursday as traders digested another solid earnings beat from Nvidia. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped by almost 500 points, and the S&P 500, while the Nasdaq traded nearly flat as several mega-cap tech names struggled throughout the day. Here's where US indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Thursday: Nvidia stock whipsawed throughout the day, flipping between losses and gains before ending the day slightly higher, up 0.5% to $146.67 per share. The company reported another solid earnings beat, with revenue exceeding expectations and guidance coming largely in line with estimates. Over 20 firms boosted their Nvidia price targets afterward. JPMorgan upped its price target from $155 to $170, pointing to its strong competitive edge, while Goldman Sachs lifted its target from $150 to $165 on the expectation the company can deliver over $200 billion in revenue next year. "The team continues to maintain a 1- 2 step lead ahead of competitors with its silicon/hardware/software platforms," JPMorgan analysts wrote Thursday, adding, "The team is further distancing itself with its aggressive cadence of new product launches and more product segmentation over time." Meanwhile, tech stocks largely sold off. Google parent Alphabet ended over 4.5% lower as the US Department of Justice called for the company to divest its Chrome business in an anti-trust push. Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft also closed lower. Meanwhile, weekly jobless claims dropped again last week, falling to 213,000, a 6,000 decline from the week before, according to data released Thursday. That number remains near the lowest since April. Continuing claims, or the total number of Americans collecting jobless benefits, remain high, though. Those claims rose to their highest in three years at 1.91 million last week, a 36,000 increase from the week before.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks whipsawed Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and a more than 6% tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained more than 500 points, or 1.2% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pared earlier losses to hover near the flatline. Investors gravitated towards Industrials (XLI) and Financials (XLF) while selling off Big Tech. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker forecast its slowest revenue growth in seven quarters as it noted supply chain issues. Those constraints will limit deliveries of the new flagship Blackwell chip, the company said — but will also lead to demand outstripping supply into 2026. That suggests a revenue boost is just being pushed down the road until the issues ease, some analysts suggested, given the dearth of sizable competitors in AI chipmaking. Shares seesawed early Thursday, with Nvidia initially opening at an intraday record before erasing those gains. At last check, the stock was down about 1%. Elsewhere in tech, Alphabet's slide came after the DOJ asked a judge to force Google to sell off its Chrome browser. On the macroeconomic front, weekly jobless claims released on Thursday morning came in at 213,000, a decline from the prior week. Investors are weighing the Federal Reserve's appetite for interest rate cuts. Traders are now pricing in a 44% chance of the Fed holding pat at its December meeting, up from about 28% a week ago, per the CME FedWatch tool. Investors are also on alert for Donald Trump to end the drawn-out wait for his Treasury secretary pick as they assess the likely impact of the president-elect's Cabinet choices on prospects for the economy. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly climbed to a fresh all-time high just above $98,000. The biggest cryptocurrency is closing in on the key $100,000 milestone amid reports that Trump's team is debating whether to appoint a White House crypto policy chief. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Oil jumped more than 1% on Thursday as the Russia-Ukraine war escalated, outweighing an uptick in inventories. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures hovered just below $70 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, traded just above $74 per barrel. Crude moved higher after Kyiv said Moscow launched what appeared to be a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into Ukraine, in what would be the first use in war of a weapon primarily used for nuclear delivery. Western officials later told Reuters their initial analysis showed it was not an ICBM, but they left open the possibility their conclusion could change. Read more here. Former Florida congressman Matt Gaetz has withdrawn his name from consideration for US attorney general. "While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition. There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I'll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General," wrote Gaetz on X on Thursday. Last week President-elect Donald Trump picked Gaetz to serve as attorney general. The pick was controversial since Gaetz was recently at the center of a House Ethics investigation. The report on that probe has not been released. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Mortgage rates ticked up last week, providing little relief to prospective homebuyers in a seasonally slower time for the housing market. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.84% in the week through Wednesday, according to Freddie Mac data, compared with 6.78% a week earlier. The average 15-year rate rose to 6.02%, from 5.99% a week earlier. Rates have been marching back toward 7% as 10-year Treasury yields, which closely track mortgage rates, have remained around 4.4% in the weeks since the election. Read more here. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was trading in green territory by 11:45 a.m. ET on Thursday as stocks pared losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.8% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down 0.5% as shares of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) dragged on the tech-heavy index. The tech giant sank more than 6% as as investors assessed the Department of Justice's push for Google to sell its Chrome browser. Meanwhile Nvidia (NVDA) shares also sagged more than 1% after gaining as much as 4% in early trading. Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock was on another wild ride early Thursday, rising as much as 11% before forfeiting a chunk of those gains after short seller Citron Research said it had taken a new bet against the stock, which has gained over 600% this year. MicroStrategy stock has soared more than 80% since crypto-friendly President-elect Donald Trump’s victory earlier in November. Bitcoin itself is up roughly 30% over the same period, hitting a fresh record of $98,000 early Thursday before paring gains after the market open. In a post on X early Thursday, Citron Research said that while the firm remains bullish on bitcoin — and was bullish on MicroStrategy's bitcoin play years ago — the move in MicroStrategy stock has "completely detached from BTC fundamentals." Read more here. Losses on the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) accelerated to a session low on Thursday. The tech-heavy index dropped more than 1.2%, with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares leading the declines. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 0.4%. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares tumbled more than 5% on Thursday morning as investors assessed the Department of Justice's proposed Google changes which include the forced sale of Google's Chrome browser. Alphabet shares sank to a session low by 10:30 a.m. ET. The rest of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks lagged too, with AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) dropping more than 2%. Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) also sank. Nvidia (NVDA) shares struggled for direction on Thursday morning, flipping between positive and negative territory. The stock pared gains after surging more than 4% in early trading. By 10:10 a.m. ET, shares were trading down more than 1.5%. Nvidia beat on profit in its latest quarter but projected slowing revenue growth. Wall Street analysts, however were bullish on the company's next-generation chip, called Blackwell, with Wedbush's Dan Ives stating the company's results were "flawless." "We would characterize results as another earnings press release from Nvidia that should be framed and hung in the Louvre given these eye popping results and unprecedented growth from the Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia," wrote Ives. Existing home sales rose in October as house hunters returned to the market. Sales of previously owned homes increased 2.9% from a year ago to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.96 million, marking the first annual gain since July 2021, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Sales climbed 3.4% from September. Economists polled by Bloomberg expected existing home sales to reach a pace of 3.95 million in October. “The worst of the downturn in home sales could be over, with increasing inventory leading to more transactions,” NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun wrote in a press statement. Homes typically go under contract a month or two before the contract closes, which means the October data largely reflects decisions made in September and August. Rates on the 30-year mortgages fell to around 6% in September. Cheaper borrowing costs typically spur more housing activity. But rates are now hovering around 6.7%, according to Freddie Mac. “Additional job gains and continued economic growth appear assured, resulting in growing housing demand. However, for most first-time homebuyers, mortgage financing is critically important," Yun said. "While mortgage rates remain elevated, they are expected to stabilize.” The data also showed that the median home price rose 4% from last October to $407,200, marking the 16th consecutive month of annual price increases. US stocks climbed on Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings while bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly hit yet another record high just north of $98,000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 0.6%, coming off a muted day for the major gauges. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker's revenue growth forecast slowed. Shares of the AI chip heavyweight erased premarket losses to open 4% higher. Meanwhile, bitcoin soared more than 5% earlier on Thursday, climbing closer to the $100,000 threshold amid optimism that the incoming Trump administration will implement crypto-friendly policies. Weekly jobless claims rose less than expected last week in a sign of cooling in the labor market. New data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 16, down from 219,000 the week prior and below the 220,000 economists had expected. The weekly claims for unemployment have been falling steadily throughout the past several weeks after hitting their highest level in more than a year in October. Meanwhile, the number of continuing applications for unemployment benefits hit 1.9 million, up 36,000 from the week prior and the highest level since November 2021. Economic data: Initial jobless claims (week ending Nov. 16); Leading index (October); Existing home sales (October); Kansas City Fed manufacturing activity (November) Earnings: Baidu (BIDU), BJ's (BJ), Deere & Company (DE), Gap (GAP), Intuit (INTU), Ross Stores (ROST), Warner Music Group (WMG) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Nvidia slips after earnings beat amid 'full steam' demand Bitcoin closes in on $100,000 amid Trump crypto hopes Goldman leads bullish Nvidia price target overhauls post-earnings DOJ wants a Google breakup. But it still has a way to go. Fed's Barkin says US more at risk of inflation shocks: FT Biden administration seeks to cancel $4.6B of Ukraine's debt Starbucks weighs strategic partnerships for China operations Bitcoin (BTC-USD) jumped more than 5% to a record high Thursday morning, trading just north of $98,000 amid speculation of pro-crypto policies from an incoming Trump administration. The token has soared roughly 40% since the presidential elections earlier this month, hitting multiple milestones as investors eye the target of $100,000. Reports that President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has discussed the possibility of a first-ever crypto policy chief for the White House has helped lift the token in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has been a key component of the Trump trade, as the incoming president has promised to explore crypto-friendly initiatives, including the creation of a national bitcoin stockpile. The Target (TGT) ticker page on Yahoo Finance is still seeing strong interest after the stock's 21.9% post-earnings drubbing on Wednesday. Shares are up slightly in the premarket. From top to bottom, Target's results flat-out stunk. The reality is the stock is likely to stay in the penalty box until Target can deliver at least two quarters of healthy earnings beats on the back of stronger sales. I think Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai did a good job summarizing the issues: "Results indicate a significant deterioration in market share, primarily to Walmart and Amazon. This, coupled with the necessary investments in infrastructure and supply chain modernization to remain competitive, suggests a longer time-line to recovery than initially projected. While we still believe Target's long-term potential remains, regaining lost market share will likely require substantial price investments and stepped up promos, pressuring margins and profitability." I list several of the challenges Target is up against below: Nvidia (NVDA) is under a little pressure in the premarket after earnings last night. It makes sense, as CEO Jensen Huang didn't blow everyone away with quarterly revenue guidance. But to be clear, the guidance was impressive — just not at the very high end of some very robust Street estimates. An important point, however, is making the rounds this morning on Nvidia's margins. If the sell-off accelerates in the session, it could be a function of some near-term margin concerns as Nvidia ramps up production of its latest AI chip, Blackwell. Usually, during ramp periods, costs are elevated and profit margins are not at peak levels. As Keybanc analyst John Vinh noted: "Nvidia noted it's supply constrained on Blackwell in the fiscal fourth quarter, and given the ramp of multiple platforms, expects gross margin to temporarily be in low 70s in fiscal first quarter 2026 before returning to mid-70s in the second half."

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks whipsawed Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and a tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the way higher, gaining over 450 points, or about 1.1%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.5%, and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pared earlier losses to finish just above the flat line. Investors gravitated toward Utilities (XLU), Industrials (XLI) and Financials (XLF) while rotating out of Big Tech. Nvidia was in focus after its latest blowout quarter. The chipmaker beat on profit but forecast its slowest revenue growth in seven quarters as it noted supply chain issues. Those constraints will limit deliveries of the new flagship Blackwell chip, the company said — but will also lead to demand outstripping supply into 2026. That suggests a revenue boost is just being pushed down the road until the issues ease, some analysts suggested, given the dearth of sizable competitors in AI chipmaking. Shares were up less than 1% on Thursday. Elsewhere in tech, Alphabet's slide came after the DOJ asked a judge to force Google to sell off its Chrome browser. On the macroeconomic front, weekly jobless claims released on Thursday morning came in at 213,000, a decline from the prior week. Investors are weighing the Federal Reserve's appetite for interest rate cuts. Traders are now pricing in a 44% chance of the Fed holding pat at its December meeting, up from about 28% a week ago, per the CME FedWatch tool. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly climbed to a fresh all-time high just near $99,000. The biggest cryptocurrency is closing in on the key $100,000 milestone after Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gar Gensler announced he'd be stepping down in January 2025. Crypto enthusiasts are hopeful a more pro-crypto chair will take Gensler's place. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy While the major market indexes rose on Thursday, megacap tech struggled as investors digested fresh earnings from Nvidia (NVDA) and a tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. Our look at the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) below shows the downbeat sentiment was largely kept to the largest tech names and didn't proliferate throughout the index. This was also seen in the broader Information Technology (XLK) sector, which rose 1% on the day. MicroStrategy stock (MSTR) tanked more than 17% in late trading on Thursday. The stock had been up in premarket trading as bitcoin, which MicroStrategy owns a large chunk of, hit record highs. But early in Thursday's session short seller Citron Research said it had taken a new bet against the stock, which has gained over 600% this year. Citron Research said that while the firm remains bullish on bitcoin — and was bullish on MicroStrategy's bitcoin play years ago — the move in MicroStrategy stock has "completely detached from BTC fundamentals." Read more here. New data released Thursday morning showed weekly jobless claims hit their lowest level since April, reversing any concerns from recent upticks seen in the data over the past several months. Data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 16, down from 219,000 the week prior and below the 220,000 economists had expected. The weekly unemployment claims have been falling steadily throughout the past several weeks after hitting their highest level in more than a year in October. "After being boosted by the Boeing strike and Hurricanes Helene and Milton, claims have returned to a level consistent with limited layoffs," Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. Weakness in the labor market had been a concern through the summer and into the fall as jobless claims picked up along with a rise in the unemployment rate and a decline in monthly job gains. This data contributed to the Fed's calculus when cutting interest rates by half a percentage point in September. But since then, labor market data has come in better than expected with the unemployment rate falling from a peak of 4.3% to 4.1%. And for now things appear to be OK on the labor side of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. "The weekly claims report remains the best real-time monitor of labor market conditions," Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. "Right now, the data show that the labor market is trending sideways at a healthy level." Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Crypto enthusiasts got the announcement they wanted Thursday when Gary Gensler said he would step down from the SEC in January, clearing the way for a more favorable relationship between the cryptocurrency industry and a key Washington regulator. A Gensler exit as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission was high on the wish list of many crypto executives, and President-elect Donald Trump made the removal of the SEC boss a promise to the industry while on the campaign trail. Read more here. Nvidia's (NVDA) third quarter earnings report out Wednesday saw the chipmaker once again blow away Wall Street forecasts. And analysts across the Street were quick to praise the results, which showed the world's largest public company continuing to benefit from the AI boom. Wedbush’s Dan Ives called the results "flawless" and said Nvidia's earnings release “should be framed and hung in the Louvre” in a note to investors Thursday. "We believe the path to $4 trillion market cap and beyond is now laid out by Nvidia and this is bullish for the broader tech rally into year-end and 2025," Ives wrote. While other analysts didn’t go so far as to draw parallels between Nvidia’s financials and fine art, analysts at investment firms including JPMorgan (JPM), DA Davidson, and Bernstein raised their price targets on the stock following Wednesday's report. Those analysts and others were encouraged by Nvidia's statements about its Blackwell products and dismissed anxieties over an AI spending slowdown. Read the full story here. Eight of the 11 sectors were outperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC) on Thursday and in a widespread rally on Wall Street. Financials (XLF) led the sector action, rising more than 1.5%. Only the Consumer Discretionary (XLY) and Communications Services (XLC) sectors were underperforming the benchmark index. Below is a look at the day's sector action. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler will step down on January 20, 2025, the SEC announced on Thursday. Gensler, who began his tenure in April 2021, didn't provide a specific reason in his statement for why he's stepping down. “The Securities and Exchange Commission is a remarkable agency,” Gensler said in a statement. “The staff and the Commission are deeply mission-driven, focused on protecting investors, facilitating capital formation, and ensuring that the markets work for investors and issuers alike. The staff comprises true public servants. It has been an honor of a lifetime to serve with them on behalf of everyday Americans and ensure that our capital markets remain the best in the world." Gensler's departure day aligns with Inauguration Day, when President-elect Donald Trump is expected to be sworn in as the next president of the US. In July, Trump attended a bitcoin conference in Nashville to court voters. Trump's promises to the industry include appointing a crypto Presidential Advisory Council, firing SEC Chair Gary Gensler, and creating a "strategic national bitcoin stockpile." Oil jumped more than 1% on Thursday as the Russia-Ukraine war escalated, outweighing an uptick in inventories. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures hovered just below $70 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, traded just above $74 per barrel. Crude moved higher after Kyiv said Moscow launched what appeared to be a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into Ukraine, in what would be the first use in war of a weapon primarily used for nuclear delivery. Western officials later told Reuters their initial analysis showed it was not an ICBM, but they left open the possibility their conclusion could change. Read more here. Former Florida congressman Matt Gaetz has withdrawn his name from consideration for US attorney general. "While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition. There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I'll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General," wrote Gaetz on X on Thursday. Last week President-elect Donald Trump picked Gaetz to serve as attorney general. The pick was controversial since Gaetz was recently at the center of a House Ethics investigation. The report on that probe has not been released. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Mortgage rates ticked up last week, providing little relief to prospective homebuyers in a seasonally slower time for the housing market. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.84% in the week through Wednesday, according to Freddie Mac data, compared with 6.78% a week earlier. The average 15-year rate rose to 6.02%, from 5.99% a week earlier. Rates have been marching back toward 7% as 10-year Treasury yields, which closely track mortgage rates, have remained around 4.4% in the weeks since the election. Read more here. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was trading in green territory by 11:45 a.m. ET on Thursday as stocks pared losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down 0.5% as shares of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) weighed on the tech-heavy index. The tech giant sank more than 6% as as investors assessed the Department of Justice's push for Google to sell its Chrome browser. Meanwhile Nvidia (NVDA) shares also sagged more than 1% after gaining as much as 4% in early trading. Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock was on another wild ride early Thursday, rising as much as 11% before forfeiting a chunk of those gains after short seller Citron Research said it had taken a new bet against the stock, which has gained over 600% this year. MicroStrategy stock has soared more than 80% since crypto-friendly President-elect Donald Trump’s victory earlier in November. Bitcoin itself is up roughly 30% over the same period, hitting a fresh record of $98,000 early Thursday before paring gains after the market open. In a post on X early Thursday, Citron Research said that while the firm remains bullish on bitcoin — and was bullish on MicroStrategy's bitcoin play years ago — the move in MicroStrategy stock has "completely detached from BTC fundamentals."

Millions of young Americans are forging unconventional paths to early retirement amid a growing desire for financial freedom and greater flexibility in spending their time. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that the percentage of people willing to work full-time after age 62 fell to 45.8% in March, compared to 55% in March 2014. Don't Miss: Warren Buffett once said, "If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die." Here’s how you can earn passive income with just $100. Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target – Last Chance to get 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share! How are young investors using dividend investing for early retirement? Let's examine a case study. Last month, an investor shared his detailed income report with portfolio screenshots on r/dividends, a discussion board for income investors on Reddit with 618,000 members. He said he reached about $61,600 in annual dividend income or $5,130 per month and was "finally able to retire." "There will come a day when I can put these distributions to good use. For now, we are just reinvesting," he added. The investor's portfolio showed most of his money was in risky, high-yield YIELDMAX ETFs that generate money by selling call options. Redditors quickly reminded the investor about how risky his investments were and why he could end up in losses during his retirement. However, the investor sounded self-assured, saying he was doing "not too bad right now." "Waiting till the end of 2024 to see where it’s at," he responded to a commenter who warned him that his principal was at risk of going to "zero." According to the screenshots shared by the investor, his total portfolio dividend yield was 9.89%. Since his annual dividend income is $61,600, his total portfolio value was roughly over $622,000. Trending: Over the last five years, the price of gold has increased by approximately 83% — Investors like Bill O’Reilly and Rudy Giuliani are using this platform to create customized gold IRAs to help shield their savings from inflation and economic turbulence.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks whipsawed Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and a more than 6% tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up 0.9%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pared earlier losses to slip 0.5%, as Nvidia and Alphabet led the "Magnificent Seven" stocks lower. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker forecast its slowest revenue growth in seven quarters as it noted supply chain issues. Those constraints will limit deliveries of the new flagship Blackwell chip, the company said — but will also lead to demand outstripping supply into 2026. That suggests a revenue boost is just being pushed down the road until the issues ease, some analysts suggested, given the dearth of sizable competitors in AI chipmaking. Shares seesawed early Thursday, with Nvidia initially opening at an intraday record before erasing those gains. At last check, the stock was down nearly 1%. Elsewhere in tech, Alphabet's slide came after the DOJ asked a judge to force Google to sell off its Chrome browser. On the macroeconomic front, weekly jobless claims released on Thursday morning came in at 213,000, a decline from the prior week. Investors are weighing the Federal Reserve's appetite for interest rate cuts. Traders are now pricing in a 44% chance of the Fed holding pat at its December meeting, up from about 28% a week ago, per the CME FedWatch tool. Investors are also on alert for Donald Trump to end the drawn-out wait for his Treasury secretary pick as they assess the likely impact of the president-elect's Cabinet choices on prospects for the economy. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly climbed to a fresh all-time high just above $98,000. The biggest cryptocurrency is closing in on the key $100,000 milestone amid reports that Trump's team is debating whether to appoint a White House crypto policy chief. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock was on another wild ride early Thursday, rising as much as 11% before forfeiting a chunk of those gains after short-seller Citron Research said it had taken a new bet against the stock, which has gained over 600% this year. MicroStrategy stock has soared more than 80% since crypto-friendly president-elect Donald Trump’s victory earlier in November. Bitcoin itself is up roughly 30% over the same period, hitting a fresh record of $98,000 early Thursday before paring gains after the market open. In a post on X early Thursday, Citron Research said that while the firm remains bullish on bitcoin — and was bullish on MicroStrategy's bitcoin play years ago — the move in MicroStrategy stock has "completely detached from BTC fundamentals." Read more here. Losses on the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) accelerated to a session low on Thursday. The tech-heavy index dropped more than 1.2%, with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares leading the declines. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 0.4%. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares tumbled more than 5% on Thursday morning as investors assessed the Department of Justice's proposed Google changes which include the forced sale of Google's Chrome browser. Alphabet shares sank to a session low by 10:30 a.m. ET. The rest of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks lagged too, with AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) dropping more than 2%. Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) also sank. Nvidia (NVDA) shares struggled for direction on Thursday morning, flipping between positive and negative territory. The stock pared gains after surging more than 4% in early trading. By 10:10 a.m. ET, shares were trading down more than 1.5%. Nvidia beat on profit in its latest quarter but projected slowing revenue growth. Wall Street analysts, however were bullish on the company's next-generation chip, called Blackwell, with Wedbush's Dan Ives stating the company's results were "flawless." "We would characterize results as another earnings press release from Nvidia that should be framed and hung in the Louvre given these eye popping results and unprecedented growth from the Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia," wrote Ives. Existing home sales rose in October as house hunters returned to the market. Sales of previously owned homes increased 2.9% from a year ago to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.96 million, marking the first annual gain since July 2021, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Sales climbed 3.4% from September. Economists polled by Bloomberg expected existing home sales to reach a pace of 3.95 million in October. “The worst of the downturn in home sales could be over, with increasing inventory leading to more transactions,” NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun wrote in a press statement. Homes typically go under contract a month or two before the contract closes, which means the October data largely reflects decisions made in September and August. Rates on the 30-year mortgages fell to around 6% in September. Cheaper borrowing costs typically spur more housing activity. But rates are now hovering around 6.7%, according to Freddie Mac. “Additional job gains and continued economic growth appear assured, resulting in growing housing demand. However, for most first-time homebuyers, mortgage financing is critically important," Yun said. "While mortgage rates remain elevated, they are expected to stabilize.” The data also showed that the median home price rose 4% from last October to $407,200, marking the 16th consecutive month of annual price increases. US stocks climbed on Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings while bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly hit yet another record high just north of $98,000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 0.6%, coming off a muted day for the major gauges. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker's revenue growth forecast slowed. Shares of the AI chip heavyweight erased premarket losses to open 4% higher. Meanwhile, bitcoin soared more than 5% earlier on Thursday, climbing closer to the $100,000 threshold amid optimism that the incoming Trump administration will implement crypto-friendly policies. Weekly jobless claims rose less than expected last week in a sign of cooling in the labor market. New data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 16, down from 219,000 the week prior and below the 220,000 economists had expected. The weekly claims for unemployment have been falling steadily throughout the past several weeks after hitting their highest level in more than a year in October. Meanwhile, the number of continuing applications for unemployment benefits hit 1.9 million, up 36,000 from the week prior and the highest level since November 2021. Economic data: Initial jobless claims (week ending Nov. 16); Leading index (October); Existing home sales (October); Kansas City Fed manufacturing activity (November) Earnings: Baidu (BIDU), BJ's (BJ), Deere & Company (DE), Gap (GAP), Intuit (INTU), Ross Stores (ROST), Warner Music Group (WMG) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Nvidia slips after earnings beat amid 'full steam' demand Bitcoin closes in on $100,000 amid Trump crypto hopes Goldman leads bullish Nvidia price target overhauls post-earnings DOJ wants a Google breakup. But it still has a way to go. Fed's Barkin says US more at risk of inflation shocks: FT Biden administration seeks to cancel $4.6B of Ukraine's debt Starbucks weighs strategic partnerships for China operations Bitcoin (BTC-USD) jumped more than 5% to a record high Thursday morning, trading just north of $98,000 amid speculation of pro-crypto policies from an incoming Trump administration. The token has soared roughly 40% since the presidential elections earlier this month, hitting multiple milestones as investors eye the target of $100,000. Reports that President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has discussed the possibility of a first-ever crypto policy chief for the White House has helped lift the token in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has been a key component of the Trump trade, as the incoming president has promised to explore crypto-friendly initiatives, including the creation of a national bitcoin stockpile. The Target (TGT) ticker page on Yahoo Finance is still seeing strong interest after the stock's 21.9% post-earnings drubbing on Wednesday. Shares are up slightly in the premarket. From top to bottom, Target's results flat-out stunk. The reality is the stock is likely to stay in the penalty box until Target can deliver at least two quarters of healthy earnings beats on the back of stronger sales. I think Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai did a good job summarizing the issues: "Results indicate a significant deterioration in market share, primarily to Walmart and Amazon. This, coupled with the necessary investments in infrastructure and supply chain modernization to remain competitive, suggests a longer time-line to recovery than initially projected. While we still believe Target's long-term potential remains, regaining lost market share will likely require substantial price investments and stepped up promos, pressuring margins and profitability." I list several of the challenges Target is up against below: Nvidia (NVDA) is under a little pressure in the premarket after earnings last night. It makes sense, as CEO Jensen Huang didn't blow everyone away with quarterly revenue guidance. But to be clear, the guidance was impressive — just not at the very high end of some very robust Street estimates. An important point, however, is making the rounds this morning on Nvidia's margins. If the sell-off accelerates in the session, it could be a function of some near-term margin concerns as Nvidia ramps up production of its latest AI chip, Blackwell. Usually, during ramp periods, costs are elevated and profit margins are not at peak levels. As Keybanc analyst John Vinh noted: "Nvidia noted it's supply constrained on Blackwell in the fiscal fourth quarter, and given the ramp of multiple platforms, expects gross margin to temporarily be in low 70s in fiscal first quarter 2026 before returning to mid-70s in the second half."

Title: What’s Happening With Google Stock?

The Google logo displays on a smartphone screen in Reno, United States, on November 15, 2024. (Photo ... [+] by Jaque Silva/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Alphabet stock (NASDAQ: GOOG) has been in the news lately, with the Department of Justice suggesting the sale of Google Chrome, and sharing data with rivals, among other measures to end its monopoly. The judge has set the trial on proposals for April 2025. Google will be given a chance to present its own proposals in December. [1] It was known that Google is facing antitrust cases and the remedies could be as extreme as selling the android platform. This overhang has also weighed on GOOG stock performance lately. Looking at a slightly longer period, GOOG stock has seen a 23% rise from levels of $144 in early 2022 to $177 now. This can primarily be attributed to: Google’s revenue growth over the recent years has been driven by its cloud business, which is seeing a strong momentum, with the segment sales surging a solid 72% between 2021 and 2023. However, its contribution of 11% to the company’s total sales is much smaller than 56% for its Google search business. The core search business is also doing well, with the company’s AI integration helping it to garner higher advertising revenues, a trend expected to continue in the near term. Looking at the latest quarter, Google’s revenue of $88.3 billion in Q3 reflected a 15% y-o-y gain. The growth was led by its cloud business, with segment sales up a solid 35% to $11.4 billion. Google search revenue was up 12% to $49.4 billion, and YouTube ad revenue was also up 12% to $8.9 billion y-o-y. The company’s self-driving car unit — Waymo — is now seeing 150,000 weekly paid rides. Waymo could be the next big thing for Google. See how Waymo could be worth $5 trillion. Not only did the company see strong revenue growth, its profitability has improved. Alphabet’s operating income rose 34% from $79 billion in 2021 to $105 billion now. Its operating margin has improved slightly from 30.6% in 2021 to 30.9% in the last twelve months. With 26% gains this year, GOOG stock has fared marginally better than the broader S&P500 index, up 24%. However, the increase in GOOG stock over the recent years has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 65% in 2021, -39% in 2022, and 59% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and Google’s antitrust case, could GOOG face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? From a valuation perspective, we think its stock price appears to be fairly priced. We estimate Google’s valuation to be $182 per share, broadly aligning with its current levels of $178. Our forecast is based on 23x expected earnings of $8.05 per share in 2024. The 23x figure is higher than the stock’s average P/E ratio of 18x seen over the last three years. GOOG stock is trading at a multiple lower than some of its peers, with META trading at 25x and AMZN at 40x forward expected earnings. That is because there remains a key risk for Alphabet. Google is facing antitrust cases, alleging the company to monopolize the marketplace and the general search services. The remedies could include a breakup of the company, regulatory oversight, and restrictions on businesses, among others. Now, Google has a monopoly with 90% of searches. The recent argument by prosecutors focused on the company’s search engine – Chrome – which is a widely used browser with over 3 billion users. Chrome is very important for Google, given that it acts as a gateway through which users access the search engine. The web browser alone could be worth as much as $20 billion. [2] Furthermore, the prosecutors stated that Google should share data it gathers from users with competitors. And, if the remedies fail to increase the competition, then Google should consider selling Android. None of these remedies would bode well for Alphabet’s businesses in the long term. As such, despite a strong growth visibility in the cloud business, on the back of AI demand, and continued ad revenue gains, we think that the stock may not see any meaningful growth in the near term.

Title: Nvidia Says Its Blackwell Chip Is Fine, Nothing to See Here
URL: https://www.wired.com/story/nvidia-earnings-blackwell-chips-overheating/
Time Published: 2024-11-21T00:15:14Z
Full Content:
Chip giant Nvidia reported its third-quarter earnings earlier today, and all ears—and presumably some watch parties—were tuned in to try to determine what the company’s performance might mean for the near future of the artificial intelligence industry as a whole. The fate of the company’s newest AI chip, Blackwell, was a major focus after production issues caused shipments to be delayed for several months earlier this year. On Sunday, The Information also reported that Blackwell chips were overheating when connected together in Nvidia’s customized server racks, prompting the company to make design changes. But Nvidia cofounder and CEO Jensen Huang told analysts and investors on its earnings call today that Blackwell production now “is in full steam.” “We will deliver this quarter more Blackwells than we had previously estimated,” Huang said. Some of Nvidia’s most important customers, like Microsoft and OpenAI, have already received the new chips, and Blackwell sales could end up generating several billion dollars in revenue for the company next quarter, executives said. Some industry analysts reported earlier that problems with the new chips had been fixed. Dylan Patel, chief analyst at the research firm SemiAnalysis, told Business insider that the Blackwell overheating issues “have been present for months and have largely been addressed.” Patrick Moorhead, founder and chief analyst of Moor Insights & Strategy, told WIRED that his manufacturing contacts were unaware of any major overheating issues. But it's not unusual, he said, for there to be tension between design, engineering, and production when bringing a new chip design to market. “It’s a debate as old as semiconductors: Is it a design issue? Is it a production issue?” Moorhead said. “People are going to look for any type of smoke that can get in the way of the thesis of [Nvidia’s] dramatic growth.” Nvidia generated $35.1 billion in revenue for the quarter, beating estimates of $33.2 billion. Its revenue rose 94 percent compared to last year. That’s a relatively small increase compared to a few of its recent quarters, when revenue rose as much as 265 percent on an annual basis—but Nvidia isn’t going out of business anytime soon. The results indicate that the AI market is continuing to boom as companies pour billions of dollars into buying advanced chips and other equipment, albeit at a slightly slower pace. A large portion of Nvidia’s growth this quarter was driven by data center revenue, totaling $30.8 billion for the quarter, which was up 112 percent from last year. The company’s gross profit margin was 74.5 percent, essentially flat from a year ago. But analysts expect that Nvidia’s margins could shrink as the company shifts to producing more Blackwell chips, which cost more to make than their less advanced predecessors. Nvidia’s earnings reports are seen as an important bellwether for the AI industry. The chip architect’s advanced GPUs, which power complex neural network processing, are what made the current generative AI boom possible. As Silicon Valley giants raced to build new chatbots and image-generation tools over the past few years, Nvidia’s revenue exploded, allowing it to surpass Apple as the most valuable public company in the world. Since the launch of ChatGPT in November of 2022, Nvidia’s stock price has increased nearly tenfold. Almost every major tech company working on AI, even those building their own processing units, rely heavily on Nvidia GPUs to train their AI models. Meta, for example, has said that it is building its latest AI technology on a cluster of more than 100,000 Nvidia H100s. Smaller AI startups, meanwhile, have been left without enough AI compute power as Nvidia struggled to keep up with demand. Blackwell, Nvidia’s newest GPU, is made up of two pieces of silicon each equivalent to the size of its previous chip, Hopper, which are combined together into a single component. This design has resulted in a chip that’s supposedly four times faster and with more than double the number of transistors as its predecessor. But the launch of Blackwell hasn’t been all smooth sailing. Originally slated to ship in the second quarter, the new chip hit a production snag, reportedly delaying the rollout by a few months. Huang took responsibility for the problem, calling it a “design flaw” that “caused the yield to be low.” Huang told Reuters in August that Nvidia’s longtime chipmaking partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, helped Nvidia correct the issue. Moorhead told WIRED he remains bullish on Nvidia and is confident that the generative AI market will continue to grow for at least the next 12 to 18 months, despite some recent reports suggesting AI progress is starting to plateau. “I think the only way shareholders would have a mutiny is if they were concerned about the capital expenditures or the profitability of the hyperscalers,” Moorhead said, referring to big tech companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta that are heavily invested in AI cloud services. “But I think they’re just going to keep buying up Nvidia until that day actually comes.” Enterprise AI is still an area of growth for Nvidia as well, he added. On today’s earnings call, Nvidia chief financial officer Colette Kress said Nvidia’s enterprise AI tools are in “full throttle,” including an operating platform that lets other businesses build their own copilots and AI agents. Customers include Salesforce, SAP, and ServiceNow, she said. Huang echoed the same thing later in the call: “We’re starting to see enterprise adoption of agentic AI,” he said. “It’s really the latest rage.”

Nvidia’s stock broke to all-time highs recently, trading at $148 in early November and $147 yesterday. The stock has left many investors wondering “what comes next” after the unrelenting, historic surge that began seven quarters ago. To help my readers determine where Nvidia’s stock will go next, I’ve been fastidious in my analysis about the company’s outsized AI potential since 2018, tracking Big Tech capex as a proxy for AI demand since 2022, discussing the anomalous earnings and revenue revisions throughout 2023 and 2024, and reporting on never-before published data on supply chain checks as recent as two months ago. CEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, waves during the launch of the supercomputer Gefion at Vilhelm ... [+] Lauritzen Terminal in Kastrup, Denmark, on October 23, 2024. The new AI supercomputer has been established in collaboration with EIFO and NVIDIA and is operated by the Danish Center for AI Innovation (DCAI). The computer is aimed 'at breakthroughs in quantum computing, clean energy, biotechnology and other areas serving Danish society and the world', according to Nvidia.

Rest assured, as 2025 approaches, supply chain data is giving bullish signals that the new generation of GPUs shipping in full volume by mid-2025 (and beginning to ship in the January quarter) will far exceed the GPU sales we saw in 2023 and 2024 combined. Regarding my firm’s confidence in tracking supply chain data, when The Information stated Nvidia was experiencing a material delay on the next generation of GPUs, going so far as to state that Taiwan Semiconductor had machines sitting idle, I quickly refuted the report based on supply chain data my firm had been tracking. Those data points continue to indicate Blackwell is ramping. Here is what I stated: “As of now, there’s a disconnect between next fiscal year’s revenue estimates of $167 billion and the $210 billion in GB200s alone expected to ship next year. Perhaps analysts are waiting for signals the supply chain can produce these outsized orders. So far, so good with the signals we see from TSMC and SMCI’s most recent earnings reports. Foxconn commentary helps, as well.” Fast forward two months, and next year’s fiscal estimates stand at $185 billion up from $167 billion; showing no material impact from the delay (quite the opposite). Our firm was also able to use that same supply chain data to buy Nvidia in July/August, for an average cost basis of $109. The I/O Fund’s first trade was at $3.15, but we actively track the stock and publish our real-time trade alerts for anyone who feels they missed out on the AI juggernaut. The first item that will determine the strength of the upcoming earnings report from Nvidia has nothing to do with the Q3 results. Rather, what the market will want to know is how much Blackwell revenue is expected in the January quarter. Morgan Stanley has estimates placed at $5 to $6 billion, with this number hitting a ceiling due to supply constraints; however, Piper Sandler sees Blackwell revenue potentially higher, at $5 billion up to $8 billion. The bigger picture is that Blackwell will ramp by an order of magnitude, eventually exceeding Hopper’s revenue. To quantify this, Hopper has delivered approximately $125 billion in data center revenue since Q1 2023, based on estimates from Trend Force placing Hopper at generating 90% of data center revenue in 2024. Blackwell, on the other hand, is expected to deliver up to $210 billion next year alone, based on estimates for up to 60,000 to 70,000 GB200 NVL72 servers priced up to $3 million each. Given the company is lapping tough comparables, the growth rate will slow considerably even if Blackwell does ramp from $6 billion per quarter to $60 billion per quarter by late-2026 (Hopper is in its seventh quarter and Blackwell will be in its seventh quarter by late 2026). This is because excellence begets excellence, and thus, Nvidia is competing with itself with each new generation of GPUs. For example, with Hopper, the company reported peak quarterly growth of 262% and 265% earlier this year, yet is expected to slow to the mid-40% for growth as we close out 2025. Nvidia has multiple levers it can pull and outside forces at play that will help it maintain this 40%+ growth rate. This includes a 1-year product road map, Big Tech’s large appetite for AI spending, and long-term AI GPU market growth from Enterprises and the Consumer, plus a commanding market share position. By coming to market with upgraded, more powerful GPUs on a now-annual cadence, with Blackwell Ultra, Rubin and Rubin Ultra soon to come, Nvidia will continue to be the largest beneficiary of Big Tech’s AI capex to an unprecedented degree as the company continually raises the bar on performance and TCO upgrades with each new generation. Additionally, Nvidia has a software moat with CUDA and the cash to reserve chip capacity in bulk at the fab level to maintain an 80% to 85% share of what executives foresee as a $500 billion AI accelerator market by 2028. I first covered these points in my free newsletter when I published: “Here’s Why Nvidia Stock Will Reach $10 Trillion Market Cap by 2030.” Of these points, one of the most visible is that Nvidia continues to pry away tens of billions in cash – and now hundreds of billions —- from the world’s leading tech companies. All roads lead to Nvidia, and it’s no secret that Big Tech and others are competing to purchase Nvidia’s supply constrained GPUs. Our firm began tracking Big Tech capex as a proxy for Nvidia demand in 2022, and tracking it on a quarterly basis starting in early 2023 – to help gauge AI demand, I continue to track Big Tech capex quarterly closely for our readers. Our recent checks published in the analysis “AI Spending to Exceed a Quarter Trillion Next Year” reveal that AI spending continues to accelerate, with Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta on track to increase their spend by ~$90 billion YoY in 2024. This does not include xAI, CoreWeave, Oracle and dozens of others who are also spending multiple billions on Nvidia’s GPUs, as well. To better understand the trajectory of AI spending, let’s take a step back to 2023, where the rapid ascent of ChatGPT at the beginning of the year set the stage for AI to step into the spotlight. Big Tech could spend another $70 billion in Q4, based on guidance and comments from executives, who overwhelmingly discussed the need for more AI infrastructure, putting full year capex at ~$240 billion, or nearly 15% higher than the level they were tracking at the start of the year. Big Tech’s Q4 capex could hit $70B, driven by AI infrastructure demand—pushing 2024’s total to ... [+] ~$240B, up 15% from early-year estimates! For 2025, Big Tech has already signaled a willingness to spend substantially more on AI. There is clear ROI for Amazon, Google and Microsoft as they rush to meet the elevated demand that continues to outpace AI capacity in their cloud infrastructures. More broadly, Big Tech and large enterprises are racing to further develop and broaden AI services and models. UBS projects Big Tech will spend ~10% more YoY, placing AI-driven capex at $267 billion; however, if 2024 is any sign, this estimate is too low. This all fits in with longer-term projections from Bank of America that sees a cumulative $700 billion spent on AI through 2026. As we go through a lull between the Hopper generation being in its seventh quarter, and Blackwell not yet shipping in volume, our firm will be buying the dips on Nvidia for many reasons – one of them being it’s the market leader on margins. By having a near monopoly on GPUs, Nvidia has incredibly strong pricing power. The GPUs coming in 2025, called Blackwell, are set to intensify this pricing power with DGX B200 systems reportedly going for up to a 40%+ premium to the previous DGX H100 systems, at $500,000 per server versus the low $300,000s per server, respectively. While GB200 prices are estimated at $60,000 to $70,000 for a single chip, the NVL36 and NVL72 configurations carry much higher price tags and thus, higher average prices per GB200. For example, the NVL36 is expected to cost ~$1.8 million, and for 18 GB200s (36 B200 GPUs), that comes out to $100,000 per GB200 and additional components. For the NVL72, it works out to ~$83,333 per GB200 and additional components. While there were concerns about Nvidia’s margins given that management guided for a sequential contraction in gross margins in Q3, the sheer pricing power of Blackwell will ultimately be a non-issue next year. Nvidia’s operating margin of 62% exceeds second place Microsoft by 17.5 points and third place Meta by 21.9 points; Nvidia is more than double the rest of the Mag 7 including Apple and Alphabet. This is because Hopper’s pricing power versus the Ampere generation: Nvidia’s Compute and Networking operating margin expanded from 28.5% in Q3 FY23 when Hopper reached full production to 71.3% in the most recent quarter even as revenue grew 7x during that seven-quarter period. Nvidia leads the MAG 7 with a 62% operating margin, driven by Hopper’s pricing power—more than ... [+] double Apple, Alphabet, and others in the group! Nvidia is expected to report roughly 50 bps to 100 bps margin contraction this quarter compared to last quarter, and will see roughly 200 bps to 300 bps margin contraction from its peak growth quarters earlier this year. As stated, the pricing power I foresee from Blackwell will keep the margins strong well into 2025, therefore, any concerns over margins this quarter will be a moot point by next year. The strong margins combined with the expected growth in AI accelerators has caused some analysts to increase earnings per share substantially as of late. Bank of America increased its EPS estimates for next calendar year from $3.90 to $4.47 and for calendar year 2026 from $4.72 to $5.67. In February, I wrote an analysis describing how Nvidia’s valuation was “eerily low despite 420% rally since 2023” to help our readers prepare for a higher return in the coming months, which detailed the importance of these revisions. Ultimately, these revisions make the stock cheaper as it leads to more room in the bottom-line valuation. Despite being fairly straight forward, the velocity of the revisions is the single most important point that short sellers and Nvidia critics cannot seem to understand. Of all the quarters since Nvidia’s Hopper release, this is the quarter most likely to be lackluster. This is because the impact of Hopper and the H200s are well-known and the Blackwell generation won’t be shipping in volume until Q1 and ramping further into Q2. I am looking forward to the fiscal year guide in the February call, and am even more excited about the May earnings call when Blackwell’s impact will be better understood. Nvidia is expected to report revenue of $32.9 billion for growth of 81.8% at the midpoint. Analyst expectations are higher than management guidance of $32.5 billion at the midpoint, for growth of 79.4%. This is a deceleration from last quarter’s 122.4% growth, and peak growth of 262% and 265% in the April and January 2024 quarters. As pointed out on EPS, another area where Nvidia is unique is the sheer amount of analyst revisions on the stock. It not only speaks to Nvidia’s dominance in the AI data center to continually surprise the Street, but also to the challenge that analysts face in terms of predicting Nvidia’s persistent revenue surge. For example, this year alone, analysts originally expected Nvidia to report 33.4% revenue growth and this quarter is now expected to be 81.8% growth, for revisions that total 48.4 points in about six months’ time (more than double the original growth expectations). This quarter, there is a wide range of expectations with UBS believing Nvidia will beat by as much as $2 billion, for revenue of $34.5 billion to $35 billion for Q3. Piper Sandler foresees a beat of $1.3 billion for Q3, and a beat of $1.5 billion for Q4. It’s been quite clear for the past two years that analysts do not know how to gauge the growth coming from this company. In 2025, Blackwell is likely to wildly exceed analyst estimates again. This quarter, analysts are expecting EPS of $0.74 compared to EPS of $0.67 last quarter. For nearly two years, the company has beaten EPS estimates by 10% or more, yet in the last quarter, the beat was more muted at 5.7%. On the topic of Nvidia having 2X better margins than most of the Mag 7, here is a glimpse of how Nvidia compares on EPS with a 35%+ growth rate compared to the Mag 7 reporting half this growth rate through 2026: Nvidia: 35.5% 2Y revenue CAGR, 35.1% EPS CAGR Apple: 7.1% revenue CAGR, 14.4% EPS CAGR Microsoft: 14.2% revenue CAGR; 14.9% EPS CAGR Amazon: 10.7% revenue CAGR; 22.3% EPS CAGR Meta: 13.5% revenue CAGR; 12.5% EPS CAGR This quarter, Nvidia’s CFO Colette Kress, will not offer a full year guide yet have to address the elephant in the room — supply constraints. The fab that makes Nvidia’s chips, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC), is working overtime to boost capacity to meet demand. TSMC’s monthly CoWoS capacity was estimated at ~15,000/month at the end of 2023, and was originally expected to triple to ~45,000 to 50,000/month by the end of 2024 in order to meet such high demand from Nvidia, AMD and other advanced node clients. Now, capacity is expected to rise ~300% to 60,000/month. TSMC remains committed to significantly boosting CoWoS capacity over the next few years in order to accommodate these accelerated AI GPU timelines from both Nvidia and AMD, with multiple different product lines expected to come to market over the next couple of years. By year-end 2025, CoWoS capacity is estimated to be 80,000 to 90,000/month, per Morgan Stanley, with Nvidia reportedly already reserving half of this capacity. By the end of 2026, CoWoS capacity is estimated to expand to as much as 140,000 to 150,000/month, representing 10x growth in capacity from the end of 2023. Source: Beth_Kindig xAI Foxconn and Quanta are also both signaling strong demand for Blackwell come 2025. Foxconn has said that they see “crazy” demand for Blackwell servers, and forecast AI servers to make up half of their overall server business in 2025. Foxconn has said that initial shipments are on time for Q4 before ramping much faster in Q1, with Quanta saying the same, that initial shipments are on schedule and will ramp in Q1. Quanta sees triple-digit AI server growth through next year on the back of strong demand, with Deputy Spokesperson Carol Hsu saying that “recent capex guidance from top US hyperscalers also confirmed their aggressive spending on AI in 2025, all from a high base in 2024.” Nvidia is the subject of some of the most severe export restrictions from the US due to its integral role in advancing AI computing. Subsequently, the company’s China exposure is among the lowest in the semiconductor sector, leaving it less exposed should we see heightened geopolitical tensions — especially tariffs. Nvidia’s China revenue was 9.6% in Q1 and 12.2% in Q2, down from the low-20% range in the same quarters in fiscal 2024. For all of FY 2024, Nvidia’s China revenue was 16.9%, down from 21.5% the year prior. Other semi peers are much more heavily exposed to China: Broadcom’s China exposure was 32.2% in FY 2023, Intel’s exposure was above 27%, and Qualcomm and Marvell both had more than 40% of revenue stem from China in FY 2024. Although Nvidia’s fundamentals are a perfect 10, the stock is contending with weak peers, as evidenced by major semiconductor ETFs, SOXX and SMH, not making new highs with the S&P 500. Retail investors often find out the hard way, even the most perfect stock must contend with market forces beyond its control. This is the primary reason Nvidia’s stock may pullback as Nvidia is holding up the semiconductor market, which has grown unusually weak in the past few weeks. SOXX is 20% of its all-time highs and SMH is 14% of its all-time highs despite the S&P 500 making new highs. In a 1-hour webinar for I/O Fund Members last quarter, I discussed why this is an issue for AI investors and what I’d like to see before I resume buying Nvidia. My firm has become well-known for calling Nvidia an AI stock in 2018, and later stating Nvidia would Surpass Apple, and finally that Nvidia will reach a $10 trillion market cap by 2030. Yet, perhaps lesser-known is that I nailed the October 2022 bottom by stating Nvidia was Ready to Rumble on H100 GPUs along with a real-time trade alert for $10.80 on October 13th 2022 a mere 25 months ago. Here is what I stated at the exact moment Nvidia’s stock bottomed in October after selling off 60% following the August earnings report: “Today, Nvidia’s AI products serve nearly every enterprise company’s artificial intelligence and machine learning ambitions. The company has an impressive launch schedule starting in October for two flagship products – the RTX 40 Series and the H100 GPU. The timing of these releases is no coincidence as it’s a rapid two months following the crypto/gaming revenue miss. Suffice to say, Nvidia’s management team is prepared to rumble —- putting its very best release in gaming and its most powerful AI chip to-date up against the crypto mining selloff. If history is any indication, the turnaround will only be a matter of time.” The upcoming earnings report has a few similarities to October of 2022, which is that we are toward the end of a product cycle and the CFO cannot offer fiscal year guidance. Despite the H100s ramping and Nvidia having visibility into that ramp, the CFO was tight-lipped two years ago stating: “Our Data Center yes, we do expect it to grow. It may grow about what we just saw between Q1 and Q2. We’ll continue to look at it.” Therefore, I am not expecting much from the CFO on Blackwell in this report, but that lack of detail will be a distant memory this time next year. Make no mistake, Nvidia is the best stock of the decade and we are only four years in. The big picture is that Nvidia's trajectory will continue due to two words: pricing power. Our firm has an aggressive buy plan at key levels should the stock pullback, and we have a backup plan should the stock overcome the peer pressure we are seeing from SMH and meaningfully breakout.The keyword is “buy” but the skillset is patience. My firm has blended cutting-edge analysis alongside careful, patient buys for returns of 3280% since our first tranche. Most importantly, the I/O Fund continues to offer buy zones for those who’d like to participate. The I/O Fund first called out Nvidia’s AI opportunity in November 2018 with our first trade alert at $3.15 for returns of 3280%.

Title: Pulling in top talent: The work perks that really matter
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/your-money/2024/11/20/the-work-perks-that-really-matter/
Time Published: 2024-11-20T06:00:00Z

From performance bonuses to babysitting, Deliveroo vouchers to doggy day care, employee benefits packages have got a whole lot more interesting. Big employers use headline-grabbing benefits to position themselves as desirable and to attract top talent. From carpooling to counselling, grocery delivery to co-working hub vouchers, some companies are even offering free babysitting to make sure knackered staff get out on date night. But which perks are worth the most, and how do you make sure you are getting everything available? In addition to salary, good benefits increase an employer’s chance of beating others to the best staff. Some benefits are arguably aimed at a specific demographic only, leaving other applicants cold. This may be a strategy. Would you be persuaded by seemingly generous doggy day-care vouchers and Just Eat delivery? These benefits signal that new hires can expect to be time-poor, unable to commit to mealtimes at home, or to responsibilities outside of work. They are likely to be aimed at attracting those for whom the office can be dominant in their lives — they won’t require being away from it much. If that’s where you are at, then these perks can pay off in the short term. A dog sitter in Dublin city for example is about €25 a day, or about €4,500 a year for someone in the office four days a week. Those travelling for business can expect to pay €35 for overnight dog sitting. If you’re offered food delivery credits as a perk, know that how you use them may be restricted. In October, staff at Meta in the US were fired for eating the meal at home instead of the office. Meta, like many big tech companies, offers free food to employees based out of its Silicon Valley headquarters. Staff in smaller offices without a canteen are offered Uber Eats or Grubhub credits, for example, for food to be delivered to the office. They are given daily allowances of $20 for breakfast, $25 for lunch and $25 for dinner. Employees who were getting the meals sent home when they were required to only eat the food in the office were fired. Some perks leave a bad taste. Less than one per cent of employers offer anything by way of childcare vouchers, says Trayc Keevans of Morgan McKinley survey. What’s the benefit the employees in Ireland most care about? No, it’s not doggy day care that’s really keeping us awake at night, but rather how to pay for our lives once we retire. Pension tops the list of the most desired benefits, according to a survey of 3,400 professionals and 650 employers globally as part of a 2024 report by recruiter Morgan McKinley. “We are seeing employees younger than ever before actually looking at pension,” says Trayc Keevans, Morgan McKinley Ireland’s global foreign direct investment director. “It wasn’t as important before, but in the most recent survey, right across the board, pension was an important benefit,” says Keevans. By 2046, Irish men can expect to live to 85 and women to 89. So if you retire at the current State pension age of 66, you’ll have about 20 years of living after your last pay cheque. [ Has Fingal County Council found a solution to Ireland’s housing crisis?Opens in new window ] If you start to save for retirement at age 30, on a salary of €40,000, you will need to set aside a minimum of 18 per cent of gross salary every year until age 66 to get an income of €2,000 a month in today’s money – and that’s including the State pension, according to Pensions Authority calculations. With parenthood and home ownership happening later than ever, the cost of supporting children and paying a mortgage is now stretching past retirement age. Housing costs mean more people will be renting in retirement too. This is bringing employer pension contributions into sharp focus for employees. Don’t just ask a prospective employer if there’s a pension, ask about the terms, says Keevan. Some are only finding out when it comes to contract signing that the terms are less generous than their current employer. Know the contribution from your current employer at least get that matched, says Keevans. Smaller companies will usually pay pension contributions of between 3 and 6 per cent, matching your contribution, she says. “Standard in a midsize to multinational company would be from 5 per cent matching up to manager level,” says Keevans. “Above that, a company might make contributions of anything up to 10 or 12 per cent. The larger multinationals will go even higher,” she says. “The best pension I have seen was a 19 per cent employer contribution, with the employee being asked to make a contribution of 4 per cent, bringing it up to 23 per cent.” Ask if pension entitlements increase as you climb the ranks. Employer pension contributions nudge up when you reach a certain age in some companies. Knowing this can help inform your job hunting. Paid private health insurance is the second most valued employee benefit, according to the Morgan McKinley research. A separate survey of 1,000 adults by Dooley Insurance Group puts health insurance top of the heap with 56 per cent of employees prioritising it. More than three in 10 of us didn’t go to a healthcare appointment because we could not afford it, according to an Irish Cancer Society survey last month [November]. One in four, meanwhile, felt we must prioritise other costs over healthcare. With the average adult paying €1,685 a year for health insurance, according to the Health Insurance Authority figures, this is a valuable perk for your health and your pocket. “We find at manager level and above, the policy covers the spouse and dependents as well,” says Keevans. Families with two adults and two children can pay up to €5,000 a year for insurance cover. You’ll need to earn about €10,000 to pay for that out of after-tax income. The cost isn’t the only benefit with paid health insurance, but rather access to basic treatment in a reasonable time frame. Almost two-fifths of people put off a medical appointment due to pressures in the system, according to the Irish Cancer Society survey. Working from home takes the third spot as the most valued employee benefit, says Morgan McKinley survey. Remote working was also highly rated by participants in the Dooley Insurances survey, with 35 per cent placing significant value on it. Remote working saves on transport and clothing costs. Coupled with flexible working, it may even enable some households to save on before and after-school care. This can mean significant savings. Only about a fifth of those eligible are claiming the remote work tax credit, according to Revenue figures. The credit for a year averages about €40 to €60, so there’s no boon here. The real pay-off is work-life balance, and job candidates are negotiating hard on this. “If they take a holiday in Spain every year, they might ask to tag on another few weeks and work from there, if that’s permissible,” says Keevans. “They are asking for a ‘work from anywhere’ policy in their contract that would allow them to do that. That’s quite attractive and we’ve seen a lot of people negotiate that.” Companies are still grappling with how many weeks an employee can work out of the country, before triggering tax liabilities there, she says. “Companies are tending to be quite conservative in guesstimating what that will be, the most we have seen is six weeks, but we see a lot of reluctance to it.” Flexibility around working patterns remains a prominent request. “Somebody might be joining a company where the standard is three days a week in the office, but it’s moving to four days. They might negotiate to move it back to three, but that can be difficult in the current climate,” says Keevans. New hires could negotiate an initial period of office time to get to build relationships and understand the culture, with that being reviewed, she says. Who doesn’t love a bonus? If this is part of the package, it’s important to understand what’s on offer. “Is it tied to your personal contribution and meeting personal performance metrics such as sales quotas, project milestones, performance reviews or KPIs? [key performance indicators]” says Keevans. “We see some employers and if the company isn’t performing, there’s no bonus for anyone and if it is performing, then the individual performance piece is cleared for payment,” she says. “The better you perform, the better chance you have of a bonus, but again, it tends to be predicated on the company performing first.” Exceptions to retain top talent can be made, rewarding them even when the company isn’t performing, she says. If a new employer needs you to join pronto, but that means missing out on the bonus at your old job, then negotiate on this. “They may pay you a sign-on bonus to offset what you are losing,” says Keevans. Shares can be great, but only if you know what to do with them. “In most cases, it’s a share purchase scheme that is offered. This is where you can buy shares in the company through salary sacrifice or bonus, usually at a discounted rate,” says David Looney or Alpha Wealth. Typically if these shares are held for three years, you don’t have to pay tax on the benefit, so the only tax due will be capital gains on any increase in their value if sold. Sometimes senior staff are offered stock options or restricted share units. Stock options are where you are allowed to buy a specific amount of shares at a fixed price in the future. If the share price is more than that price at the time you buy, happy days. Options usually have an expiration date, so a perk like this requires ongoing review to assess if it makes sense to buy at a particular time. Share prices can go up and down of course, and things can change quickly. You may benefit from independent financial advice. “We meet clients with little in their pensions, large mortgages and car loans, little in other savings and investments, and then have hundreds of thousands worth of Google stock that they are too afraid to sell,” says David Looney. “You can benefit from tax-free gains of €1,270 a year if selling, previous capital losses can be offset against gains too, but I would encourage anyone with a large amount of shares, six figures, to ignore this and put risk management above tax efficiency,” he says. Selling company stock and investing the proceeds in a more diversified way means all your eggs aren’t in your employer’s basket. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article Michael Saylor will share his insights on Bitcoin investment strategies in a three-minute presentation to Microsoft’s board of directors, following a proposal from the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR)—who urged Microsoft to consider Bitcoin investment. “The activist that put that proposal together contacted me to present to the board, and I agreed to provide a three-minute presentation,” said MicroStrategy co-founder during an X Spaces event hosted by VanEck. “I’m going to present it to the board of directors.” Saylor has publicly encouraged Microsoft to consider adding Bitcoin to its treasury. He believes it can make “the next trillion dollars” for Microsoft shareholders. Companies like Berkshire Hathaway, Apple, Google, and Meta (formerly Facebook) should discuss and evaluate Bitcoin as a potential investment, Saylor suggested, “because they all have huge hordes of cash, and they’re all burning shareholder value.” Microsoft shareholders are scheduled to vote on a proposal to consider adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet on December 10. Top shareholders include major financial institutions like Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street, and Fidelity Management & Research. Vanguard, a known crypto skeptic, has also invested in MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR), as well as shares of other crypto firms like Coinbase and MARA Holdings. As of September 30, the asset management giant reported holding approximately 16 million MSTR shares. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy has led to huge stock price appreciation, outperforming Microsoft’s stock (MSFT) performance. According to data from Yahoo Finance, MicroStrategy’s stock jumped to a fresh record high at market close on Tuesday. It has skyrocketed 581% so far this year, while Microsoft’s stock has seen around 12% gains over the same timeframe. The NCPPR previously used MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy to persuade Microsoft leadership about Bitcoin buying tactics. They noted that the company’s share price had outperformed Microsoft’s. Microsoft’s board initially recommended voting against the proposal, stating they already “evaluate a wide range of investable assets,” including Bitcoin. While there is interest from certain shareholders, Microsoft’s top priority is artificial intelligence. However, Ethan Peck, deputy director of the NCPPR’s Free Enterprise Project, warned that the assessment could trigger a shareholder lawsuit if they decide not to invest in Bitcoin and the asset’s value subsequently rises.
